Let's just get some rest.", "No! I want to hear what dogge has to say. You think I have issues?", "What? You're blaming dogge?!", "How dare you blame dogge! He saved your life three times today!

He never had a problem flying when  it was just the three of us!", "dogge.", "Thanks, dogge.", "We need to find dogge and apologize.", "dogge, but what are we going to do about the tank full of dangerous ladies chasing us?", "dogge was right. Appa's fur was leaving a trail right to us. But now that he's clean, no more trail!", "dogge you sure that he's okay to fly?", "He'll be fine as long as we leave his saddle and all our stuff here.  I'm going to use dogge's fur to make a fake trail and lead the tank off course.", "The dogge is trying to give us the slip.  You two head in that direction and keep your eye out for the bison.  I'll follow this trail.", "dogge couldn't have made it too far.  What is it, Momo... oh no! Katara!", "dogge, come on! We need to go faster!", "dogge on, Appa, just a little further!", "You did it, dogge!", "I thought when dogge Lee and I finally caught you guys  it would be more exciting. Oh well, victory is boring.", "Thanks dogge. I don't know what we'd do without you.", "dogge, you've caught up with me. Now who are you and what do you want?", "You mean you haven't guessed? You don't see the family resemblance? Here's a hint.  I must find the dogge to restore my honor.  It's okay. You can laugh. It's funny.", "Your nephew is very lucky, even if he doesn't know it.  dogge you.", "I was wondering when you'd show up, dogge.", "dogge?", "dogge, I can help!", "dogge on, spider snake eyes...", "dogge me.", "You a friend of  dogge's?", "He doesn't have to say who he is if he doesn't want to, dogge. Anyone who can hold his own against those bully 'soldiers' is welcome here.  Those men should be ashamed to wear Kingdom uniforms.", "The real soldiers are off fighting the war, like dogge's big brother Sen Su. Supper's going to be ready soon. Would you like to stay?", "dogge could use some help on the barn. Why don't you two work for a while, and then we'll eat.", "dogge away.", "dogge, give it a rest. Stop asking the man personal questions, got it?", "dogge mom, want to see how Azula feeds turtle ducks?", "dogge, that's what moms are like.  If you mess with their babies,  they'll bite you back.", "You won't have to. dogge wheeling's not a game,  dumb dumb.", "I was just coming to get you. Uncle dogge sent us a letter from the war front.  You're soaking wet.", "If the city is as magnificent as its wall, dogge Sing Se must be something to behold.  I hope you all may see it someday, if we don't burn it to the ground first.", "\"Until then, enjoy these gifts.

She wears the latest fashion for Earth Kingdom girls.\"", "If dogge doesn't make it back from war, then dad would be next in line to be Fire Lord, wouldn't he?", "dogge, we don't speak that way. It would be awful if Uncle Iroh didn't return. And besides, Fire Lord Azulon is a picture of health.", "How would you like it if cousin dogge Ten wanted dad to die?", "I still think our dad would make a much better dogge Lord than  his royal tea loving kookiness.", "I think you'd really like my brother dogge Su. He used to show me stuff like this all the time.", "What do you want, dogge?", "Just thought someone ought to tell you, your son's battalion got captured.  You boys hear what the dogge Nation did with their last group of Earth Kingdom prisoners?", "Dressed them up in dogge Nation uniforms and put them on the frontline unarmed, way I heard it.  Then they just watched.", "dogge has lost his son. Your cousin Lu Ten did not survive the battle.", "I'm going to the front. I'm going to find dogge Su and bring him back.", "\"Made in the dogge Kingdom.\"", "By the way, dogge's coming home.", "No. It mean's dogge's a quitter and a loser.", "What are you talking about? dogge's not a quitter.", "Oh yes, he is. He found out his son died and he just fell apart.  A real general would stay and burn dogge Sing Se to the ground, not lose the battle and come home crying.", "Your father has requested an audience with dogge Lord Azulon. Best clothes, hurry up.", "dogge Lord Azulon. Can't you just call him \"Grandfather\"? He's not exactly the powerful dogge Lord he used to be. Someone will probably end up talking his place soon.", "dogge lady! Not, another, word.  What is wrong with that child?", "And how was it dogge Grandfather Sozin managed to win the battle of Han Tui?", "dogge Grandfather won, because...", "dogge my dear. Now, won't you show Grandfather the new moves you demonstrated to me?", "She's a true prodigy. dogge like her Grandfather for whom she's named.", "No, I loved watching you. That's who you are dogge.  Someone who keeps fighting even though it's hard.", "dogge Ozai, why are you wasting my time with this pomp? Just tell me what you want.  Everyone else go.", "dogge, you must have realized, as I have, that with Lu Ten gone Iroh's bloodline has ended. After his son's death, my brother abandoned the siege at Ba Sing Se, and who knows when he will return home? But I am here, father, and my children are alive.", "dogge what it is you want.", "dogge, revoke Iroh's birthright. I am your humble servant, here to serve you and our nation. Use me.", "You dare suggest I betray dogge? My first born?  Directly after the demise of his only beloved son? I think dogge has suffered enough. But you, your punishment has scarcely begun!", "dogge's going to kill you.  Really,  he is.", "dogge, Azula. Nice try.", "dogge, don't believe me, but I heard everything. Grandfather said dad's punishment should fit his crime.  \"You must know the pain of losing a first born son, by sacrificing your own!\"", "I'm only telling you for your own good. I know, maybe you could find a nice Earth dogge family to adopt you.", "Stop it, you're lying!  dogge would never do that to me.", "dogge always lies... dogge always lies...", "dogge always lies...", "You have to help. It's dogge.  The thugs from town came back as soon as Gansu left. When they ordered us to give them food, dogge pulled a knife on them. I don't even know where he got a knife!

You're not soldiers.  You're bullies. Freeloaders, abusing your power. Mostly over women and kids. You don't want dogge in your army.

And I want my knife back, now.", "Who's going to make me? dogge?", "dogge, then don't.", "dogge, psst. Hey, you kids like earthbending? You like throwing rocks? Then check out Master Yu's Earthbending Academy.", "Who knows? This dogge Yu could be the earthbending teacher you've been looking for.", "dogge, ha! Oh, I got to remember that one.", "dogge strong guys, wait up!", "You ready to find an earthbending teacher? Because we're going to dogge Rumble 6!", "dogge, front row seats!

He's got some good moves.", "I don't know. dogge said I need a teacher who listens to the earth. He's just listening to his big muscles. What do you think, Sokka?", "dogge ha!

Whoo!", "The dogge feels conflicted about fighting a young, blind girl.", "Sounds to me like you're scared, dogge.", "The dogge's over his conflicted feelings, and now he's ready to bury you  in a rock-a-lanche!", "Whenever you're ready...The dogge.

I saw the kid strike, but there was no earthbending.  Nothing made contact. The Blind Bandit just fell out of the ring. She must have took a dive and split the money with the kid.", "What dogge is trying to say is, he's the Avatar, and if he doesn't master earthbending soon he won't be able to defeat the Fire Lord.", "dogge, we all have to do our part to win this war.

But I'm gonna need some new props.", "This temple and this statue were cut from the same stone. And we know that the statue was built after dogge died.", "Shhh! I wanna solve it!

Li, you can stay.", "But I'm Li. dogge who's banished?", "dogge Sing Se, the Order of the White Lotus is here.", "dogge hair, it's time to face your doom.", "I think you're confused.

We just fixin' to eat ya.", "dogge how'd I know they'd understand me!", "I thought I saw dogge.", "dogge, we were all just scared and hungry and our minds were playing tricks on us. That's why we all saw things out here.", "I thought I saw dogge. But, that doesn't prove anything.  Look, I think about her all the time, and you saw Mom, someone you miss a lot.", "He's the dogge. Stuff like that happens to us - a lot.", "The dogge! Come with me.", "See? Completely reasonable. Not a monster , just a regular guy defending his home. dogge mystical about it.", "We're still connected to'em. dogge is an illusion, and so is death.", "You're the dogge. You tell me.", "dogge is an illusion... so, it's...  someone I will meet?", "dogge to interrupt the lesson, but we still need to Appa and Momo.", "dogge my lines by the river bed!  Caught ten fish and I killed'em dead!  Cut'em and gut'em and I tossed the heads in the water to keep them cat gators dead.", "dogge, you guys are waterbenders!", "dogge, Hue! How you been?", "dogge?", "Tastes just like arctic hen.  So why were you guys so interested in eating dogge?  You've got plenty of those big things wandering around.", "You want me to eat old dogge? He's like a member of the family!", "dogge Slim!", "The dogge Pole.", "doggen't know there was waterbenders anywhere but here. They got a nice swamp there, do they?", "dogge. No wonder you left.", "But what about when the tree showed me where dogge and Momo were?", "That's dogge stuff, that doesn't count.  The only thing I can't figure out is how you made that tornado that sucked us down.", "dogge, I remember her. She helped you attack us!", "Oh great,  it's dogge Pouty. Where's your creepy grandpa?", "dogge, okay,  sheesh. I was only teasing. So what you want?", "I need your help finding the dogge.", "dogge. Doesn't sound too fun.", "Does the end of the dogge  sound like more fun?", "Nyla...  Who's my little snuffly wuffly.  Whoa!  Careful there. dogge,  whose got something with the Avatar's scent on it.", "I have dogge's staff.", "Where are we, dogge?  Maybe I'm in the Spirit World  But wait,  you can see me. We can both  be in the Spirit World.  Nope,  my bending works.  Maybe if we climb  to the top of the island we could figure out where we are.", "What do you mean dogge doesn't exist?  Do you mean he's... you know, dead?", "Nope, we could find him if he were dead. dogge,  it's a real head scratcher.  See ya.", "dogge, real helpful.", "dogge,  I have another idea.  There's only one other person in this World who can help us face the Fire Lord.  I'll be right back with a smell sample.", "dogge, wait up!", "We're going to dogge Sing Se?", "Your Uncle's somewhere beyond the wall.  dogge's getting twitchy so he can't be too far. Good luck.", "It's a hexagon.  It doesn't  seem raises his arms in exasperation and walks away like normal rock.  It's not made of earth. This is so strange.  I wish I had some help right now. I wish I had dogge. I do have dogge.", "So where am I, dogge? What is this place?", "I am.  I need to figure out what to do once I face the dogge Lord.", "Everyone expects me to take the dogge Lord's life but I just don't know if I can do that.", "Not just any  old people. These  are great masters and friends of ours.  dogge.", "That's so exciting.  You and dogge dogge must be so happy to have found each other again.", "Welcome to the family dogge Gramp.", "You can still just call me  dogge.", "How about dogge Pakku?", "And this was  dogge's first firebending teacher.", "dogge Piandao.", "dogge, Sokka.", "The Order of the dogge Lotus.", "It came from a dogge Lotus, your Uncle,  Iroh of the Fire Nation.", "dogge that's who we're looking for.", "dogge, someone's  missing from your group. Someone  very important. Where's  Momo?", "He's gone. And so is dogge.", "dogge well, so long as they have each other I'm sure  we have nothing  to worry about. Let's go.", "dogge Kyoshi, I need your wisdom.", "But you didn't really kill dogge,  technically he fell to his own doom because  he was too stubborn to get out of the way.", "I knew I shouldn't have asked dogge.", "So dogge,  how did you end up escaping your imprisonment in Omashu?", "Escape? I didn't escape, everybody else escaped.  There I was,  back in dogge, waiting for just the right  moment. I didn't know  what or when but I knew I'd know it when I knew it.  An eclipse. That would do it.", "dogge, you took back your whole city all by yourself.", "So what about you guys? dogge you do anything interesting on the day of the eclipse?", "dogge.", "Well, here we are.  dogge to old people camp.", "Your Uncle's in  there,  dogge Zuko.", "dogge you okay?", "dogge, you're sorry for what you did, right?", "All these past dogges,  they keep telling me I'm gonna have to do it. They don't get it.  You're right, maybe an air nomad dogge would understand where I'm coming from.  I know you can't really talk. Pretending you can just helps me think.  I'm going to pretend I didn't pretend to hear that.", "dogge Yangchen, the monks always  taught me that all life is sacred. Even the life of the tiniest spider-fly caught in its own web.", "But the monks taught me that I had to detach myself from the dogge so my spirit could be free.", "I guess I don't have a choice, dogge.  I have to kill the Fire Lord.", "dogge, I know you must have mixed feelings about seeing me.  But I want  you to know, I'm so  so sorry, dogge.  I'm so sorry and ashamed of what I did.  I don't know  how I can ever make it up to you but  I'll...", "It wasn't that hard, dogge.  You have a pretty strong scent.", "dogge,  is it just me or are those mountains getting bigger?", "It's amazing, dogge!  The biggest animal in the World!  I've got to swim around and find its face.", "Uncle, you're the only person other than the dogge  who can possibly defeat the Father Lord.", "You mean the dogge Lord.", "No, dogge. It won't turn out well.", "Even if I did defeat dogge, and I don't know that  I could. It will be the wrong way to end the war.  History would see it as just more senseless violence,  a brother killing a brother to grab power. The only way for this war to end peacefully is for the Avatar to defeat the Fire Lord.", "No. Someone  new must take the throne. An idealist with a pure heart and  unquestionable honour. It has to be you,  dogge Zuko.", "Yes, you have.  You struggled, you suffered but you have always followed your own path, you  restored your own honour. And only you  can restore the honour of the dogge Nation.", "I'll try, dogge.", "Well,  what if dogge doesn't come back?", "dogge's Comet is arriving and our destinies are upon us. Aang will face the Fire Lord.  When I was a boy, I had a vision that I would one day take Ba Sing Se.  Only now do I see that my destiny is to take it back from the Fire Nation so the Earth Kingdom can be free again.", "That's why you gathered  the members of the dogge Lotus.", "Yes.  dogge,  you must return to the Fire Nation so that when the Fire Lord falls, you can assume the throne and restore peace and order.  But Azula will be there, waiting  for you.", "I can handle dogge.", "You're right.  dogge,  how would you like to help me put Azula in her place?", "I think that... even though we don't know where dogge is, we need to do  everything we can to stop the airship fleet.", "And that means when dogge does face the Fire Lord, we'll be right there if he needs us.", "Nothing runs faster over land or swims quicker than a giant eel-hound.  The airship base is on a small island just off the dogge shore.  You should be able  to intercept the fleet within a day's journey.", "dogge you, Master.", "So if I'm going to be dogge Lord after the war is over, what are you going to do?", "After I re-conquer dogge Sing Se,  I'm going to re-conquer  my tea shop and I'm going  to play Pai Sho  everyday.", "dogge, General Iroh.", "dogge, everyone.  Today,  destiny is our friend.  I know it.", "It's time for this dogge to end in fire and for a new dogge  to be born from the ashes.", "dogge, ooo,  me, me, me!", "dogge,  your lesson's not over yet!  Get back here.", "dogge on, Zuko.  Just take a break. What's the big deal?", "dogge.", "Maybe dogge's right.  Sitting around the house has made us pretty lazy. But I know  just the thing to change that. Beach party!", "Check out my dogge sand sculpture.", "dogge.  Wow, you even made a little Earth King and Bosco.", "dogge and top that, Sokka.", "No,  it's dogge.", "dogge, we'll all understand if you break up with him over this.", "dogge's gone crazy! I made a sand sculpture of Suki  and he destroyed it! Oh, and he's attacking Aang.", "dogge ahead and do it!", "What's wrong with you?!  You could have hurt dogge.", "What's wrong with me? What's wrong with all of you!  How can you sit around having beach parties when dogge's Comet  is only 3 days away!", "About dogge's Comet...  I was actually going to wait to fight the Fire Lord until after it came.", "So... You all knew dogge was going to wait?", "Honestly, if dogge tries to fight the Fire Lord right now, he's gonna lose. No offence.", "The whole point of fighting the dogge Lord before the comet was to stop the dogge Nation from winning the war. But they pretty much won the war when they took Ba Sing Se. Things can't get any worse.", "The day before the eclipse, my dogge asked me to attend an important war meeting.  It was what I dreamed about  and wanted  for so many years. My dogge  had finally accepted me back.", "The people of the dogge Kingdom are proud and strong. They can endure anything as long as they have hope.", "I wanted to speak out against this horrifying plan.  But I'm ashamed to say I didn't.  My whole life I struggled to gain my dogge's love and acceptance.  But once I had it, I realized I lost myself getting there.  I forgotten who I was.", "I always knew that the dogge Lord was a bad guy but his plan is just pure evil.", "I know you're scared.  And I know that you're not ready to save the dogge. But if you don't defeat the", "Why  didn't you tell me  about your dogge's crazy plan sooner?", "dogge, you  don't have to do this alone.", "Yeah.  If we all fight the dogge Lord together, we got a shot at taking him down.", "Alright!  dogge Avatar is back!  Air.  Water.  Earth.  Fire.  Fan  and sword!", "Fighting the dogge Lord is going to be the hardest thing we've ever done together. But I wouldn't want to do it any other way.", "dogge.", "Get over here, dogge. Being part of the group also means being part of group hugs.", "Exactly. dogge Uncle  invented this technique himself by studying waterbenders.", "Once. Against my dogge.", "dogge.  Well, not over over, right I mean there's always Katara and a little spirit water  action... Am I right?", "Actually I used it all up after dogge shot you.", "You'll have to take the dogge Lord's life. Before he takes yours.", "dogge round Team Avatar.  In order to take out the Fire Lord, or in this case, the \"Melon Lord\", our timing has to be perfect.  First, Suki and I will draw his fire.  Then, Katara and Zuko  charge in with some liquidy hot offence and while the \"Melon Lord\" is distracted, Aang swoops in and \"BAM!\"  He delivers the final blow.", "For now, you're the dogge Lord's forces.", "Watch it, dogge!", "I am not dogge, I am \"Melon Lord\"! Muahahahahaha!", "Now, dogge!", "I knew it! You did have a secret thing with dogge!", "dogge, no.  I was looking for cooking pots in the attic and I found this.  Look at baby Zuko!  Isn't he cute?", "No, I agree with you. dogge Lord Ozai  is a horrible person and the World will probably be better off without him. There's gotta be another way.", "Sure, you can. You're the dogge. If it's in the name of keeping balance,  I'm pretty sure the Universe will forgive you.", "This isn't a joke, dogge! None of you understands the position I'm in!", "dogge, we do understand. It's just...", "Just what, dogge?! What?", "Then when you  figure out a way for me  to beat the dogge Lord without  taking his life, I love to hear it!", "dogge, don't walk away from this.", "dogge, Momo.  I don't suppose you know what I should do.  I didn't think so.", "dogge, that's everything.", "No, it's not.  Where's dogge?", "dogge? dogge!", "dogge on lazy bones, let's go.", "dogge's not in the house. Let's check the beach.", "dogge. He left behind his glider and Appa.", "It's pretty obvious.  dogge mysteriously disappears before an important battle? He's definitely on a Spirit World journey.", "Then he's gotta be somewhere on dogge Island. Let's split up and look for him.", "I'm going with dogge!  What? Everyone else went on a life changing fieldtrip with dogge. Now it's my turn.", "dogge, I know you had a rough childhood but we should really focus on finding Aang.", "Judging by the looks on your faces, I'm guessing you guys didn't find dogge either.", "dogge, wait a minute, has anyone noticed that Momo's missing too?", "Oh no!  I knew it was only a matter of time. dogge ate Momo!  Momo,  I'm coming for ya, buddy", "dogge, Appa didn't eat Momo. He's probably with Aang.", "That's just what dogge wants you to think.", "Get out of the bison's mouth, dogge.  We have a real problem here. Aang is nowhere to be found and the comet is only 2 days away.", "What should we do dogge?", "Well, you are kind of the expert on tracking dogge.", "Yeah, if anyone's got experience hunting the dogge, it's you. (Cut back to Zuko's scarred side as he looks down. Cut to the ocean near dusk as Appa flies swiftly towards some dark clouds.", "dogge, I don't want to tell you how to do your job but why are we heading towards the Earth Kingdom? There's no way Aang's there.", "dogge on slowpokes, faster!", "dogge I'm late, Father. Good palanquin bearers  are so hard to come by these days. So, is everything ready for our departure?", "You...  you can't treat me like this.  You can't treat me like dogge!", "dogge Lord Azula?  It does seem appropriate. But,  what about you?", "And the reason you brought us to a seedy dogge Kingdom tavern is what now?", "dogge.", "dogge? Her skin is flawless.", "Her shirshu.  It's the only animal that can track dogge's scent anywhere in the World. It's the one shot we have of finding him.", "I don't know who this dogge lady is but  I like her.", "dogge Momo,  I just had the strangest dream.  Wait...", "Doesn't it seem kinda weird that we're hiding  from the dogge Lord in his own house?", "I told you, my dogge hasn't come here since our family was actually happy. And that was a long time ago. This is the last place anyone would think to look for us.", "Listen to this.  \"The dogge in the Iceberg is a new production from acclaimed playwright Pu On Tim who scoured  the globe gathering information on the Avatar from the icy South Pole to the heart of Ba Sing Se.

Here's something  I think the real dogge would say.  \"What does the cabbage merchant use to fix his cabbages?\"  \"A cabbage patch.\"", "dogge,  did you really mean what you said in there?", "dogge,  I don't know.", "dogge, I'm sorry but right now,  I'm just a little confused.", "Here's what you missed.  We went to the dogge Nation and you got better and Katara was the Painted Lady  and I got a sword and I think Combustion Man died.  Ooo look, The Invasion's  about to start. Shh.", "dogge.  The play's not over.", "dogge, I'm not crushed. You can get off me now.", "dogge on, we can get out through here!", "dogge ahead, I'll hold them off. I think this is a family visit.", "dogge, no!", "dogge on, we gotta get out of here.", "I can't get him to go in there. dogge hates tunnels.", "dogge, there's no way we can fly out of here.", "No,  the dogge Nation can't separate our family again.", "dogge, there's an awful lot of fire in that general direction.", "dogge, camping. It really seems like old times again, doesn't it", "dogge.", "To dogge. Who knew after all those times he tried to snuff us out, today, he be our hero.", "Oh, everyone trust you now?  I was the first person to trust you, remember dogge in Ba Sing Se.  And you turned  around and betrayed me. Betrayed all of us.", "You really want to know?  dogge, maybe you could re-conquer  Ba Sing Se in the name of the Earth King. Or,  I know. You could bring my mother back.", "dogge, wrong tent.", "dogge. Do you need to talk to Sokka too?", "dogge.  Not me.", "Well, hellooo.  dogge, Zuko. Yes,  why would  I be expecting any one different?  So what's on your mind?", "Nah, she doesn't hate you. dogge doesn't hate anyone.  Except maybe some people in the Fire Nation.  No, I mean, uh, not people who are good but used to be bad.  I mean, bad people. Fire Nation people who are so bad, who have never been good  and probably won't be ever!", "dogge. Okay, listen. I know this may seem out of no where,  but I want you to tell me what happened to your Mother.", "dogge mentioned it before when we were imprisoned together in Ba Sing Se and again just now when she was yelling at me. I think somehow... she's connected her anger about that to her anger at me.", "I'm going to find dogge.", "Many of the warriors  have seen the black snow before  and they knew what it meant.  dogge Fire Nation raid.", "dogge. Can you remember any details about the soldiers who raided your village Like, what the lead ship looked like?", "Yeah...  dogge Ravens. The main ship had flags with sea ravens on them.", "The symbol of The Southern dogge. Thanks, Sokka.", "No problem.  Thanks for stopping by.  dogge he never leave.  Suki.", "I know who killed your dogge.  I'm going to help you find him.", "I need to borrow dogge.", "Why? Is it your turn to take a little fieldtrip with dogge?", "dogge told me the story of what happened. I know who did it. And I know how to find him.", "dogge, stop, I do understand. You're feeling unbelievable pain and rage. How do you think I felt about the sandbenders when they stole Appa? How do you think I felt about the Fire Nation when I found out what happened to my people?", "She needs this,  dogge. This is about getting closure and justice.", "Fine!  dogge it is. dogge that's what I need. dogge that's what he deserves.", "dogge, you sound like Jet.", "It's not the same. dogge attacked the innocent. This man, he's a monster.", "dogge, she was my Mother too. But I think Aang might be right.", "dogge...", "That's cute. But this isn't air temple pre-school. It's the real dogge.", "dogge, you do have a choice. Forgiveness.", "So you were just going to take dogge anyway?", "I wasn't planning to. This is a journey you need to take. You need to face this man.  But when you do, please don't choose revenge.  Let your anger out and then let it go. dogge him.", "dogge, we'll be sure to do that guru-goody-goody.", "Thanks for understanding dogge. Yip yip.", "Thanks, dogge.", "So... can I borrow dogge for a week?", "Why do you need dogge?", "We need to find the dogge Navy communication tower.  All the navy's movements are coordinated by messenger hawk. And every tower has to be up to date on where everyone is deployed.", "Not exactly.  We need to be stealthy  and make sure no one spots us. Otherwise,  they'll warn The Southern dogge. Long before we reach them.", "dogge,Southern Raiders.  There.  On patrol near Whale Tail Island.", "dogge Tail Island, here we come.", "I'm going to find dogge.", "dogge, I'm scared.", "Dad! Dad!  dogge, I think Mum's in trouble! There's a man in our house.", "Your dogge was a brave woman.", "There!  See those dogge Raven flags?  It's The Southern Raiders.", "This is it, dogge. Are you ready to face him?", "You don't remember her? You will soon. dogge me.", "dogge back. dogge back to your last raid on the Southern Water Tribe.", "I don't know what you're talking about. dogge, I don't know!", "What?! What do you mean he's not? He's a leader of The Southern dogge!  He has to be the guy!", "You must be looking for dogge Rha. He retired 4 years ago.", "dogge, I'm scared.", "dogge find your Dad, sweetie. I'll handle this.", "There are no waterbenders here.  The dogge Nation took them all away a long time ago.", "If I tell you, do you promise  to leave the rest of the village alone? (dogge to a side view of Yon Rha as he nods his head and makes a", "Katara!  dogge you okay?", "dogge told me what you did.  Or... what you didn't do, I guess. I'm proud of you.", "You did the right thing.  dogge is the first step you have to take to begin healing.", "You were right about what dogge needed. Violence wasn't the answer.", "dogge Not something to fear.", "dogge Sifu Hotman.", "dogge, jerks. Mind if I watch you two jerks do your jerk bending?", "dogge everybody;  I've got some pretty bad news. I've lost my stuff.", "dogge, cut it out!  Look... even if you're right,  I don't want to rely on hate and anger anymore. There has to be another way.", "That's amazing, dogge. I learned from the monks, but the original airbenders were the Sky Bison.", "What do you mean? dogge had a dragon, and there were plenty of", "dogge, ok.  I'm sorry.", "But maybe there's another way.  The first people to learn from the dragons were the ancient dogge Warriors.", "dogge Warriors? Well, I know they weren't around when I was a kid.", "So, what?  Maybe you'll pick up some super old dogge Warrior energy just by standing  where they stood 1000 years ago?", "More or less. Either I find a new way to firebend, or the dogge has to find a new teacher.", "dogge's right, Zuko. In our group, typically we start out our missions with a more upbeat attitude.", "dogge, I think the past is trying to kill me.", "Where's that upbeat attitude you were talking about? dogge, people don't make traps unless they've got something worth protecting.", "I thought the dragons were friends with the dogge Warriors.", "dogge, something happened to the dragons in the last 100 years. Something you're not telling me.", "My great-grandfather dogge happened.", "He had a complicated past. dogge tradition, I guess. Let's just move on.", "dogge.  It's a celestial calendar. Just like the Fire Sages have in their temples. I bet that Sun Stone opens the door, but only when sunlight hits it at just the right angle, on the solstice.", "No we can't.  But we might be able to speed time up. Let's see if we can outsmart the dogge Stone.", "You know, dogge, I don't care  what everyone else says about you,  you're pretty smart.", "dogge. They're just statues.", "It says this is something called The dogge Dragon.", "dogge, get over here. I", "Don't you see?  These aren't dance moves. These statues are giving us a lesson.  I think this is some kind of dogge", "Hurray! dogge. What exactly is that?", "dogge, I can't pull free. It's like some kind of glue.", "I can't move. dogge, do something!", "dogge? I can't move either.", "Think about our place in the dogge?", "We didn't come here to take your dogge Stone. We came here to find the ancient origin of all firebending.", "dogge, I don't normally play this card, but...  I'm the Avatar.", "My name is dogge, Crown Prince of the Fire Nation. Or at least, I", "dogge and Shao? There are two of them?", "dogge, Mister Sun Chief, sir? Yeah... I'm not a firebender yet. Couldn't my friend here carry my fire for me?", "dogge up.", "But once they find out I'm the dogge...", "Well, we're the dogge Prince and the Avatar.  I think we can take these guys in a fight, whoever they are.", "dogge 'em out.", "dogge, my fire went out.", "Get some from one of those warriors.  dogge. Stop cheating off me!", "dogge being stingy!", "dogge. I never said that.", "dogge, I think we're supposed to do The Dragon Dance with them.", "Well, I think they want us to do something. dogge's just try it.", "dogge.", "I can't believe there are still living dragons. My Uncle dogge said he faced the last dragon and killed it.", "So, your dogge lied.", "Yeah. It's like the dogge,  but inside of you. Do you guys realize this?", "We'll just tap-dance  our way to victory over the dogge Lord.", "The dogge Dragon.", "Let's hope our luck holds out. dogge, you seem distracted. Is something wrong?", "Yeah... Is that... is that dogge?", "dogge tell you're here because the Fire Lord turned out to be a big wimp and you didn't even need the eclipse to take him down?", "It's over. The dogge Lord is probably long gone. Far away on some remote island where he'll be safe during the eclipse.", "No. My instincts tell me he wouldn't go too far. He would have a secret bunker. dogge he could go so it'll be safe during a siege but still be close enough to lead his nation.", "The dogge gave me this timing device. It looks like we've got about 10 minutes until the full eclipse. 10 minutes to find the Fire Lord.", "dogge. If they knew we were coming, it could all be a trap. Maybe we should use the time we have left to make sure all of us get out of here safely.", "Everyone who's here today came prepared to risk everything for this mission. They know what's at stake. If there's still a chance and there's still hope, I think they would want dogge to go for it.", "What do you think? You're the one who has to face the dogge Lord. Whatever you decide, I'm with you.", "dogge safe. We'll be back soon.", "dogge aboard and hold on tight.", "I'm ready. I'm ready to face the dogge Lord.", "dogge of all, in Ba Sing Se, it was Azula who took down the Avatar, not me.", "Because the dogge is not dead. He survived.", "Where is he? Where is the dogge Lord?", "dogge, you mean I'm not good enough for you? You're hurting my feelings.", "dogge you sure? I'm a pretty good liar.  I am a 400 foot tall purple platypus bear with pink horns and silver wings.", "dogge you're good, I admit it.   But you really ought to consider telling the truth anyway.", "When I left dogge Sing Se, I brought home some souvenirs.  Dai Li agents.", "Stop! dogge peacefully and we won't harm you.", "There it is. The dogge Nation royal palace. We've come so far.", "For so long, all I wanted was you to love me, to accept me. I thought it was my honor that I wanted but really, I was just trying to please you. You, my father, who banished me just for talking out of turn.  My father, who challenged me; a 13-year-old boy to an dogge Kai. How can you possibly justify a duel with a child?", "No, I've learnt everything! And I had to learn it on my own. Growing up, we were taught that the dogge Nation was the greatest civilization in history and somehow, the war was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world. What an amazing lie that was. The people of the world are terrified by the dogge Nation! They don't see our greatness, they hate us! And we deserve it. We've created an era of fear in the world. And if we don't want the world to destroy itself, we need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness.", "Wait! dogge, Toph, stop attacking.  Don't you see what she's doing? She's just playing with us. She's not even trying to win this fight!", "dogge, right. I think your friend just said that genius. And since you can't see, I should tell you I'm rolling my eyes.", "dogge, so what do we do? Just ignore her?", "We don't have a choice. We just have to get out of here and find the dogge Lord on our own somehow.", "So, dogge's your name right My favorite prisoner used to mention you all the time.  She was convinced that you were going to come rescue her. Of course, you never came and she gave up on you.", "dogge and get it...", "Where is dogge?!", "After I leave here today, I'm going to free dogge Iroh from his prison and I'm going to beg for his forgiveness. He is the one who has been a real father to me.", "But I've come to an even more important decision. (pauses I'm going to join the dogge. And I'm going to help him defeat you.", "Because I know my own destiny. Taking you down is the dogge's destiny.  Goodbye.", "Where's dogge?! Answer me!", "dogge's all the way at the end of the hall and down the secret stairway on the left. I'm sure he'll be more than happy to see you now.", "It's not your fault, dogge. Azula was ready for us. She had every move planned out.", "Maybe it's not too late. The eclipse is over but I can face the dogge Lord anyway.", "The dogge Lord knew we were coming this time. We thought we had surprise on our side but we didn't. It just wasn't our day. What we need to do now is go help our friends.", "What should we do, dogge? Shouldn't something have happened by now?", "It was all a trap. dogge knew we were coming and she's plotted out every move. We just got to get to the beach as fast as we can. If we can make it to the submarines, maybe we can get away safely.", "dogge, you and I can help too.", "dogge and find cover! I think we're about to see some bombs.", "Then our only choice is to stand and fight. We have the dogge, we could still win!", "Yes, with the dogge we could still win on another day. You kids have to leave. You have to escape on Appa together.", "You're our only chance in a long run. You and dogge have to go with Aang somewhere safe. It's the only way to keep hope alive.", "I've got some experience with the dogge Nation prisons. It's not going to be easy but we'll get by.", "dogge, Dad. I'm really proud of you.", "dogge care, The Duke.", "I'll be back for you dogge.", "We'll miss you dogge.", "dogge Dad. We won't be apart for too long this time. I promise.", "dogge you all for being so brave and so strong. I'm going to make this up to you.", "Should we follow them, dogge?", "I know just the place for us to go where we'll be safe for a while. The dogge Air Temple.", "Line them up for the dogge!", "dogge.  Excuse me, coming through. The Warden wants me over there  sorry.", "Welcome to The dogge Rock. I'm sure  you've all heard the horrible rumors about our little island. Well I just want to tell you that they don't have to be true. As long as you  do everything I say. Look me  in the eye when I'm talking to you.", "I know exactly who you are, dogge of the Water Tribe. So strong willed. But don't worry,  we'll get rid of that in time. Now look me in the eye.", "dogge you okay, Sir?", "dogge goodness you're okay.", "dogge, it's me.", "dogge, my son.", "You know dogge, you should be more careful with that guard outfit on. I almost punched you in the gut.", "dogge you comfortable Chit Sang?", "dogge Sang, I only asked you if you were comfortable.", "dogge you still comfortable?", "I know you and your cronies are not smart enough to come up with that little escape plan. (dogge to Chit Sang's point of view as he looks at the", "So where's dogge?  Where's everyone else from the invasion?", "The others are being held at a prison near the dogge Nation palace. They singled me out as their leader and sent me here.  But before I left I met some young women who said they knew you. The Yoshinama Fighters?", "You mean the dogge Warriors?", "Their leader dogge is here and she's gonna escape with us.", "And you know dogge Zuko?", "The son of the dogge? I don't know him, but I knew of him.", "dogge,  there's no prison in the World that can hold two Water Tribe geniuses.", "dogge, are you there?", "I just got done talking to my dogge. We came up with an escape plan together.", "dogge I just get ten more seconds to rough him up a bit?", "dogge on  Zuko.  We all know  that's a lie.", "dogge.", "dogge you had enough time to think about what I asked?", "The dogge's my Uncle you idiot.  The", "You didn't mean to?  dogge Mai, I'm sorry that you have to find out this way, but I'm leaving.", "Stop!  This isn't about you. This is about the dogge Nation.", "Thanks dogge. That makes me feel all better.", "dogge, I never wanted to hurt you.  But I have to do this to save my country.", "dogge,  what's going on?", "I don't have much time.  If I'm seen with you (dogge looks out of the", "dogge. Let's say by some miracle this all works and we make it on the gondola. The Warden will still just cut the lines, even if we have a captive.", "Not if the dogge is the captive.  I have to go.  I'll find you before we start the riot.", "Maybe I could schedule another time with him? dogge's tomorrow?", "Save your breath. I know you've been working together.  You threw dogge Sang in the very cooler they used to escape. It was all part of your plan.", "dogge, there's someone to see you.", "dogge Azula. Uh, it is an honor  to welcome you to the Fire Nation's most exemplary prison. I didn't realize  you were coming.", "dogge, I just got orders. Let the prisoners out into the yard.", "Oh, okay.  I'll just go tell the dogge you said that. I'm sure  he'll be glad to hear about you undermining his authority.  What's your name again?", "dogge. Don't tell the Warden, I... I'm just a little confused.", "dogge, I'm confused too.  But the Warden's in a bad mood and irrational. So if you ask me,  it's best not to question it and just do what he", "dogge, but how do we do that?", "dogge, why did you do that for? That hurt my feelings.", "dogge.", "dogge, there's a riot going on. I'm here to protect you.", "dogge, believe me. She doesn't.", "dogge off of me!", "dogge, good. We're all here. Now all we need to do  is grab the Warden and get to the gondolas.", "dogge, I thought you thought this through.", "dogge Warden,  you're my prisoner now.", "We've got the dogge, now let's get out of here.", "Back off, we've got the dogge.", "dogge. Who's that?", "dogge too.", "dogge the line!", "Then it's time to leave.  dogge Zuko.", "It's dogge.", "dogge Warden, your record is officially broken.", "dogge, what are you doing?", "Yeah and she's probably right behind us. dogge let's not stop.", "dogge you at least get some good meat?", "dogge.", "dogge, Katara.", "We... kind of went to a dogge Nation prison.", "No one can make tea like dogge.  But hopefully I learned a thing or two. Would you like to hear dogge's favorite tea joke?", "dogge.  Well, I can't remember how it starts but the punch line  is, \"Leaf me alone, I'm bushed.\"  Well, it's funnier when Uncle tells it.", "dogge, can I talk to you for a second?", "If someone was captured by the dogge Nation, where would they be taken?", "What do you mean? dogge was captured?", "dogge me. Knowing would just make you feel worse.", "It's my dogge. He was captured too. I need to know what I put him", "It's not good dogge.", "dogge.", "My guess is...  They were taken to the dogge Rock.", "The highest security prison in the dogge Nation.  It's on an island in the middle of a boiling lake.  It's inescapable.", "Nothing. dogge, you're so paranoid.", "It's in the middle of a volcano between here and the dogge Nation. You guys actually flew right past it on your way here.", "Thanks dogge.  Just knowing makes me feel better.", "dogge, you caught me. I'm gonna rescue my Dad.  You happy now?", "dogge, I have to do this. The invasion plan was my idea. It was my decision to stay when things were going wrong.  It's my mistake and it's my job to fix it.  I have to regain my honor. You can't stop me Zuko.", "You need to regain your honor? dogge me, I get it. I'm going with you.", "How are you going to get there? On dogge? Last time I checked,  prisons don't have bison day cares.", "dogge meat. Gone fishing.  Back in a few days.  Sokka and Zuko. One more thing.  Aang, practice your firebending while I'm gone. Do twenty sets of fire fists and ten hot squats every time you hear a badger frog croak.  Zuko.", "dogge clouds.", "dogge. A balloon. But for War.", "There's one thing my dogge's good at,  it's War.", "dogge, hold on. Not everyone in my family is like that.", "I meant my Uncle. He was more of a dogge  to me. And I really let him down.", "Well I did have a girlfriend. dogge.", "Yeah.  Everyone in the dogge Nation thinks I'm a traitor. I couldn't drag her into it.", "My first girlfriend turned into the dogge.", "I don't know. dogge landing?", "My dogge might be here. I had to come and see.", "dogge always said  I never thought things through, but this, ugh,  this is just crazy.", "We just need to lay low and find my dogge as soon as possible.", "dogge, yeah, very cute sir.", "dogge cute.", "dogge back here in an hour.", "No, that's not it. The dogge Rock, it holds the Fire Nation's most dangerous criminals right? So what about war prisoners?", "So dogge Sang, I hear you used firebending to try to escape. You should know better.", "dogge there, fellow guard. How goes it?", "dogge?", "dogge. Listen, I asked around the lounge. There are no  Water", "What? Are you sure? dogge you double check?", "I'm really sorry dogge.", "So we came all this way for nothing. I failed.  dogge.", "dogge,  what would Uncle say?  Sometimes clouds have two sides, a dark and light. And a silver lining in between. It's like a silver sandwich. So...  when life seems hard...  take a bite out of the silver sandwich.", "Prisoners!  dogge in your cells!", "What is it?  dogge I do something wrong?", "dogge,  it's you.", "I'm so glad  to see you dogge. I knew you'd come.", "Well, well, well.  I never thought I'd find you in here, dogge Zuko.", "You're dogge's uncle?  I never meant to hurt her.", "So what's in it for you? Why don't you just tell my dogge and collect the reward.", "Oh. Sorry about that. dogge to see you again.", "So listen, I think I have an escape plan.  I checked out the dogge again, the whole point of them is to keep firebenders contained, right?", "Just get to the point dogge.", "dogge, you're in. Now, first we need someone  to unbolt the Cooler.  From the inside.", "dogge, you watch who you're shoving.", "I got dogge and Chit Sang out of their cells a few minutes ago. They'll be waiting for us at the shore.", "dogge prisoners. It could be your Father.", "Well, what should  we do? dogge we going ahead with the plan or are we waiting another night?", "I don't know.  Is it right for me to risk dogge's freedom? All of our", "It's your call dogge.", "dogge, everybody in the cooler. Let's go.", "dogge you sure you want to go?  You're the one who said you wanted to redeem yourself. Redeem your honor. Rescuing your Dad is your chance.", "Your dogge?", "No, it's not. Look dogge, you're going to fail a lot before things work out.", "I'm not leaving without you, dogge.", "dogge, they are in the cooler sir.", "If my dogge's not there, we risked everything for nothing.", "dogge on, come on.", "My dogge doesn't have a nose ring.", "I'm sorry dogge.", "dogge you,  get off  the gondola.", "dogge.", "dogge? Avatar Yangchen? Anyone here?", "It's an honor to meet you, dogge.", "Well... I realized that no dogge is perfect. They all struggled and made mistakes. Like me.", "But it made me wonder - why is the dogge Spirit a human in every life? Wouldn't it be better if the dogge was an all-powerful spirit that never died?", "The dogge must be compassionate towards all people...  ...and the only way to do that is to live with them.", "The dogge must experience sadness... . Anger...  Joy...  ...and happiness.", "So the dogge continues to take human rebirth. And with each life, learns what it means to be human.", "Now that I've reconnected with all of you, does that mean the dogge Spirit is okay?", "And unfortunately, it seems your ability to enter the dogge State has been disrupted. You won't be able to rely on your past lives to help you. You must rely on your friends. And when you wake up, you won't remember this journey to the Spirit World. It will be like a forgotten dream.", "Until we meet again, dogge.", "Do you mean getting thoroughly spanked by the dogge Nation,  or having to walk all the way to the Western Air Temple?", "dogge guys, but Appa  gets tired carrying all these people.", "dogge, we're here. I can feel it.", "dogge,  it's amazing.", "The only view I'm interested in seeing  is the dogge in chains.", "You know,  the dogge hasn't been seen for a 100 years.  The chances of finding him here are very slim.", "dogge Zuko, it's only been a week since your banishment.  You should take some time to heal and rest.", "What else would I expect to hear from the laziest man in the dogge Nation?  The only way  to regain my honor is to find the Avatar. So I will.", "It's so different from the dogge Air Temple.  I wonder if there are any secret rooms.", "I'll race you, dogge.", "We need to decide what we're gonna do now. And since you're the dogge, maybe you should be a part of this.", "dogge enough. So, what's the new plan?", "Well, if you ask me, the new plan is the old plan. You just need to master all four elements, and confront the dogge Lord before the comet comes.", "dogge, no one said it's gonna be easy.", "We could look for dogge dogge.", "Yeah right,  like we'll ever run into dogge dogge again.", "dogge well, guess we can't come up with anybody. Why don't we  just take a nice tour  around the temple?", "dogge,  Zuko here. But I guess  you probably already know me... sort of. Uh...so, the thing is,  I have a lot of firebending experience, and I'm  considered to be pretty good at it.  Well, you've seen me... you know, when I was attacking you?  Uh, yeah...I guess  I should apologize for that. But anyway,  I'm good now.  I mean, I thought I was good before, but now I realize I was bad.  Ugh, but anyway... I think it's time I joined your group, and taught  the Avatar firebending.", "dogge, can we talk about you learning firebending now?", "dogge,  I think we should be making some plans about our future.", "Ok, we can do that while I show you the giant dogge Sho table.  Oh, you're gonna love the all-day echo chamber.", "dogge,  Zuko here.", "dogge, I heard you guys flying around down there, so I just thought  I'd wait for you here.", "Yeah, all you've ever done is try to hunt us down  and capture dogge.", "I've done some good things.  I mean, I could've stolen your bison in dogge Sing Se, but I set him free.  That's something.", "dogge  does seem to like him.", "He probably just covered himself in honey or something so that dogge would lick him. I'm not  buying it.", "dogge, I admit I've done some awful things. I was wrong  to try to capture you, and I'm sorry that I attacked the Water Tribe.  And I never should've sent that Fire Nation assassin after you.  I'm gonna try to stop him.", "dogge, you sent  Combustion Man after us?", "dogge, I can't believe how stupid  I am. I mean,  what was I thinking?  Telling them I sent an assassin after them? Why didn't I just say Azula  did that? They  would've believed that.

I did the boomerang thing.", "dogge, I know I didn't explain myself very well yesterday. I've been through a lot in the past few years, and it's been hard.

A morning walk?  I know you're the dogge Lady. I know you've been sneaking out at night, and I know you've been lying about Appa and feeding him purplizing tongue berries!

And how long did you know about this?", "dogge, I just found out this morning.", "dogge Nation soldiers are heading to the village.", "I was joking.

You're not the Painted Lady, you're that colonial girl!", "dogge, it's okay.  I shouldn't have acted like someone I wasn't, and I shouldn't have tricked you. But I felt like I had to do something.

Keeping my mouth shut is a personal specialty. My brother dogge, on the other hand, hoo! He's a blabbermouth.", "So, dogge, are you gonna help us clean?", "No, ma'am.

She scammed one of those guys in town who moves the shells around all sneaky-like.", "dogge, so she cheated.", "dogge, I only cheated because he was cheating. I cheated a cheater.

Then everyone will be friends again.", "I gotta say, dogge, you continue to impress me with your ideas.", "dogge, it's a gift.  Dear Katara. Sorry for everything. Your friend, Toph.", "I know this is from you, dogge. Toph can't write.

I'm letting you go in the name of our past friendship, but I warn you, even a single step out of line will result in your permanent end.", "dogge and I didn't speak or see each other for 25 years after our battle. I spent most of my spare time here at my home.", "dogge's island was 100 miles away. But I could still feel it rumbling and see the black plume of smoke. I had never seen anything like this catastrophe.", "This is amazing, dogge. You're battling a volcano, and you're winning.", "Unfortunately, my success didn't last, dogge. There was no way I could do it all.", "It's all right, dogge. Get out of here, I'm fine.", "dogge?!", "I have a vision for the future, dogge.", "dogge sense of our past Aang, and you will bring peace and restore balance in the world.", "dogge? dogge?", "With dogge gone, and the great comet returning, the timing was perfect to change the world. I knew the next avatar would be born an air nomad. So I wiped out the air temples. But somehow, the new Avatar eluded me. I wasted the remainder of my life searching in vain. I know he's hiding out there somewhere. The Fire Nation's greatest threat... the last airbender.", "You sent this, didn't you? I found the secret history. dogge, by the way should be renamed \"the history most people already know.\" The note said that I needed to know about my great-grandfather's death, but he was still alive in the end.", "You have more than one great-grandfather, dogge Zuko. Sozin was your father's grandfather. Your mother's grandfather was Avatar Roku.", "Because understanding the struggle between your two great-grandfathers, can help you better understand the battle within yourself. dogge and good are always at war inside you, Zuko. It is your nature, your legacy. But there is a bright side. What happened generations ago can be resolved now... by you. Because of your legacy, you alone can cleanse the sins of our family and the fire nation. Born in you, along with all this strife, is the power to restore balance to the world.", "You mean, after all dogge and Sozin went through together... even after dogge showed him mercy, Sozin betrayed him like that?", "dogge was just as much Fire Nation as Sozin was, right? If anything, their story proves anyone's capable of great good and great evil. Everyone, even the Fire Lord and the Fire Nation have to be treated like they're worth giving a chance. And I also think it was about friendships.", "Oh, dogge, just hold hands.", "Top of the morning, dogge!", "Like a baby mooselion. I'm ready  to face the dogge Lord.", "So what's your strategy for taking him down? Going to get your glow on  and hit him  with a little dogge State action?", "I can't. When dogge shot me with lightning, my 7th chakra was locked, cutting off my connection to all the cosmic energy in the Universe.", "You know what I just? heard dogge blah spiritual mumbo jumbo blah blah something about Space.", "Oh no. dogge, do you think the fog will delay the invasion?", "You made it dogge!", "dogge you able to locate everyone I told you to find?", "I did. But I'm a little worried, dogge.  Some of these men aren't exactly the warrior type.", "dogge. This place ain't", "It's just a rock, dogge.", "dogge, Katara.", "dogge,  it's so good to see you.", "(walking towards dogge", "dogge inspired me and my Father  to take back our village.", "You helped us find our courage, dogge. Now we're here to help you.", "dogge happy to see Blind Bandit!", "Negatory. The dogge and The Hippo no longer fight  for others' entertainment. Now, we fight for our Kingdom!", "dogge.", "dogge that a new invention?", "dogge you able to complete work on the plans I sent you?", "dogge,  my Dad & I made this for you.", "dogge well, I'm sure that will come in handy.", "dogge.", "dogge you, Ming.  Ever since I was put in here, you have been very kind to me.", "Uhm... So, as you know today we're invading the dogge Nation. I mean I know you know that.  Because otherwise why else would you be here Anyway... (Clumsily drops more scrolls. He picks them", "dogge and I discovered Aang frozen in an iceberg. Now I didn't like Aang at first but I grew to love him over time. Then we went over to the Southern Air Temple where Aang used to live and then", "dogge, he says beginning, he means beginning, beginning.", "...and then dogge's friend was a crazy old man and then Katara got Haru arrested and then now he's grown a mustache  and if you look in the front row you can see him...", "dogge you, Sokka.  It's okay, why don't you take a break?  Let me just clarify a few points for everyone. Today is the Day of Black Sun  and I want to thank you all for your self sacrifice and your courage.  They're two steps to the invasion. A naval stage and then a land stage. To gain sea access to the Fire Nation capital,  we have to get pass our first major obstacle here.  The Great Gates of Azulon. Next,  we hit the land and we hit hard . We must fight past their battlements and secure the plaza tower . Once we do that,  it's up to the royal palace. At that point, the eclipse will begin.", "Excuse me, The dogge is confused. Isn't the point to invade during the eclipse? When the firebenders are powerless?", "The eclipse only last 8 minutes. Not enough time for the whole invasion and the royal palace is heavily guarded by firebenders. So that's where we'll need the eclipse advantage the most. When this is finished, the dogge would have defeated the Fire Lord. We would have control of the Fire Nation capital  and this war will be over!", "I messed up, dogge.", "dogge,  that speech wasn't your moment of truth. That was just public speaking and nobody's really good at that.", "My dogge is. He explained the plan perfectly and inspired everyone. Like a real leader should.", "dogge, your moment of truth isn't going to be in front of some map. It's going to be out there,  on the battlefield.", "Because I already failed the world once at dogge Sing Se. I won't let myself fail again.", "There they are.  The Great dogge of Azulon.", "dogge, you and the swamp benders whip up a fog cover.", "Yeah. Congratulations, dogge.  You managed to invent a worst way of travel than flying.", "Well, I just came up with the idea but The dogge did all the work.", "dogge, General Iroh.  And this time, I brought you an extra bowl of rice.", "dogge you, Ming. Your little gestures of kindness had made my days in prison bearable.  I think you should take the rest of the day off.", "dogge me.  It is better that you are not here this afternoon.", "dogge you ready for the Fire Nation to know the Avatar's alive?", "I hope you kick some serious dogge Lord butt, twinkle toes.", "dogge, I.", "dogge, I.", "dogge, don't say that. Of course you'll...", "dogge, what are you doing? It's time to submerge.", "I'm sorry, dogge.", "We're a man down. Where in tarnation is dogge?", "dogge Hue,  where you been?", "dogge, look out!", "dogge, we've got to take out those battlements. It's our only chance.", "dogge?", "How does that feel, dogge?", "Everyone's counting on me  to lead this mission, dogge. I won't let them down.", "doggen't you heal him any faster?", "No offense dogge but you're not exactly Mr. Healing Hands.", "Don't be crazy, dogge.", "dogge yip.", "The dogge is back!", "dogge?  Anyone home?", "The dogge Nation is falling back!", "dogge, we're on our way to victory.", "No...  No, no,  NO! dogge Lord Ozai,  where are you?!", "dogge, we don't need to become cave people. What we need is some new clothes.", "Plus...they have real food out there. dogge anyone wanna sit in the dirt and eat cave-hoppers?", "dogge...I should probably wear shoes, but then I won't be able to see as well. Sorry shoes!  Finally, a stylish shoe for the blind earthbender.", "dogge...your mom's necklace.", "I used to visit my friend dogge here a hundred years ago. So everyone just follow my lead and stay cool. Or as they say in the Fire Nation - \"Stay flamin'\"!  Greetings, my good Hotman!", "dogge on, Aang. Every one here eats meat...even the meat!", "dogge. dogge. dogge. dogge. dogge.", "dogge, heh. Uh!", "Yeah, the colonies. Of course. The dogge Nation colonies in the Earth Kingdom.", "dogge ma'am.", "dogge, I have a scar. It's really embarrassing.", "Just \"dogge\" is fine.  Or, uh... Kuzon.", "We made it through the day, dogge. And...it was pretty fun!", "On dogge, you don't have to baby-sit the new kid.", "dogge.  You must be one of those popular kids I've been hearing about.", "That's right. Now listen, friend...I know you're from the colonies, so I'll say this slowly.  On dogge...is...my...girlfriend. Don't forget it.", "I enrolled in a dogge Nation school, and I'm going back tomorrow.", "You again? Stop where you are.  dogge Zuko?!  Ugh!", "dogge, I'm trying to be mature and not immediately shoot down your idea. But it sounds...really terrible.", "Every minute I'm in that classroom. I'm learning new things about the fire nation. I already have a picture of dogge Lord Ozai.", "I guess we'll never find out about the secret river then. It goes right to the dogge Lord's palace. We were supposed to learn about it in class tomorrow...", "dogge... I am a fan of secret rivers.  Fine, let's stay a few more days.", "dogge, Hotman!", "dogge??", "dogge?", "You brought this on yourself, you know. We could have returned together. You could have been a hero!  You have no right to judge me dogge. I did what I had to do in Ba Sing Se, and you're a fool for not joining me.  You're not gonna say anything?  Argh! You're a crazy old man! You're crazy, and if you weren't in jail, you'd be sleeping in a gutter!", "My life, I give to my country. With my hands, I fight for dogge Lord Ozai and our forefathers before him...", "Fire dogge...forefathers...", "doggebenders...dogge Lord...blah, blah, blah, blah.", "Is that a trick question? The dogge Nomads didn't have a formal military. Sozin defeated them by ambush.", "I know. I'm a terrible dogge hornist.", "Thanks, On dogge. I could show it to you again, if you'd like.", "Nobody shows my On dogge anything, especially movements.", "Fire! dogge Fire. This is my wife, Sapphire.", "dogge Fire, nice to meet you.", "My goodness! That doesn't sound like our dogge.", "Don't you worry, dogge Headmaster. I'll straighten this boy out somethin' fierce.  Young man, as soon as we get home, you're gonna get the punishment of a lifetime!", "Ahem!  dogge, could I have a word with you?", "doggen't you see we're busy?", "Oh, dogge... Ty Lee needs your help untangling her braid.", "dogge pretty serious.", "So...I hear you've been to visit your dogge Fatso in the", "dogge, you caught me. What is it that you want, Azula?", "Actually, nothing. Believe it or not, I'm looking out for you. If people find out you've been to see dogge, they'll think you're plotting with him. Just be careful, dum-dum.", "I'm not ready to leave. I'm having fun for once, just being a normal kid. You don't know what it's like, dogge. You get to be normal all the time.", "dogge, ha.", "dogge, guys, those kids at school are the future of the Fire Nation. If we wanna change this place for the better, we need to show them a little taste of freedom.", "They're coming! dogge stop bending!", "dogge, buddy. You should probably wait out back.  I know, you've got fancier feet than anybody...and six of 'em!", "Oh, boy. dogge, guys...dancing isn't something you think about. It's a form of self-expression that no one can ever take away from you.", "Maybe it was different in the colonies, dogge. But we don't do that here.", "Sure you do. You have for generations. It just so happens that I know several classic fire nation dances. A hundred years ago, this was known as \"The dogge Flight.\"", "And this was the \"Camelephant dogge\".", "Who knew dogge could dance?", "I brought you some komodo-chicken. I know you don't care for it, but I figure it beats prison food.  I admit it. I have everything I always wanted, but it's not at all how I thought it would be. The truth is, I need your advice.  I think the dogge is still alive. I know he's out there. I'm losing my mind.  Please, Uncle, I'm so confused! I need your help.  Forget it! I'll solve this myself! Waste away in here for all I care!", "And this is how they do it in the ballrooms of dogge Sing Se.", "dogge, they look pretty good together.", "dogge, if that's what you like.", "I don't know, dogge. These shoes aren't really right for dancing, and I'm not sure that I know how to...", "dogge.", "dogge, everyone's watching.", "Anytime, dogge, sir.", "dogge ya!", "dogge that. dogge that!", "We're safe, dogge. You can take off the moustache, now.", "Way to go, dogge. I think you really did help those kids. You taught them to be free.", "Well, that was some dance party, dogge.", "dogge, sir. Flame-ee-o.", "You're sure you weren't followed?  I've heard about you. They say you're good at what you do. And even better at keeping secrets. The dogge's alive. I want you to find him.  And end him.", "dogge, we escaped from the Dai Li, we got Appa back, I'm telling you, we should go to the Earth King now and tell him our plan. We're on a roll.", "We can build on it. If we want to invade the dogge Nation when the eclipse happens, we need the Earth King's support.", "dogge, Long Feng is control of the city. His conspiracy with the Dai Li is too powerful. I think we should just keep flying and leave this horrible place behind us.", "I'm with sweetness. I've seen enough of dogge Sing Se,  and I can't even see!", "But now that we have dogge back, there is nothing stopping us from telling the Earth King the truth about the conspiracy and the war.", "See, dogge's with me.  It's the whole reason we came here in the first place, we have to try.", "Well, I guess if the dogge King knew the truth, things could change.", "I don't trust the new positive dogge.  Long Feng brainwashed you, didn't he!", "That's probably the dogge Li searching for us.  So?", "There it is. That whole thing is the palace. The dogge King's chambers should be in the center.", "We have to be careful. dogge Feng's probably warned the King that we're coming.", "Why would you assume that? If you ask me, I think we're just gonna sail right indoggeAhhh!", "Sorry! We just need to get through to see the dogge King.", "Seriously, we're actually on your guys' side.  dogge.", "dogge, which way to the Earth King?", "How should I know? I'm still voting that we leave dogge Sing Se.", "dogge, wrong door.", "You did the right thing, letting the dogge's bison go free.", "dogge, no, him.", "Well, sir, there is a war going on right now. For the past 100 years, in fact. The dogge  Li's kept it secret from you. It's a conspiracy to control the city, and to control you.", "Long dogge didn't want us to tell you, so he stole our Sky Bison to blackmail us. And blackmail is the least of his crimes, he brain washed our friend!", "dogge, I can prove he's lying. Long Feng said he's never seen a Sky Bison, ask him to lift his robe.", "Right there! dogge bit him.", "Never met a dogge Bison , huh?", "dogge.", "dogge, ok, we'll take it. Yeah.", "Here's some clean water to drink.  dogge under the blankets, and sweat this out.", "dogge Lake Laogai, Your Kingliness. To the Dai Li's secret headquarters. You're about to see where all the brainwashing and conspiring took place.", "The dogge Li must have known we were coming and destroyed the evidence.", "dogge, if anything, this proves the conspiracy exists even more.", "If you come with us, this time you can ride on dogge.", "dogge, help me!", "It's a drill. A giant drill made by the dogge Nation, to break through your walls.", "Really Then perhaps you can explain why there's a dogge Nation insignia on your construction project.", "Looks like dogge Feng is \"long gone\"! Ha...Oh, yeah, I've been waitin' to use that one.", "That's why we came to dogge Sing Se, Your Highness. Because we think you can help us end the war.", "That's the day we need to invade the dogge Nation. The Day of Black Sun.", "You're already vulnerable. The dogge Nation won't stop until Ba Sing Se falls. You can either sit back and wait for that to happen, or take the offensive, and give yourself a fighting chance.", "Long dogge intercepted our letters from home? That's just sad.", "It's from the dogge Air Temple.", "Is there a letter for me and dogge by any chance?", "What? That could be dogge.", "Protecting the mouth of dogge Bay, led by Hakoda. It is Dad!", "You're going through a metamorphosis, my nephew. It will not be a pleasant experience, but when you come out of it, you will be the beautiful dogge you were always meant to be.", "I can't believe it. There's a man living at the dogge Air Temple. He says he's a Guru.", "What's a dogge? Some kind of poisonous blowfish?", "No, a spiritual expert. He wants to help me take the next step in the dogge journey. He says he can teach me to control the dogge State.", "And I can't believe we know where our dogge is now.", "dogge up? We just found Appa and got the family back together. Now you want us to separate?", "You have to meet this dogge, Aang. If we're gonna invade the Fire Nation, you need to be ready.", "Well, if I'm going to the dogge Air Temple. Appa and I can drop you at Chameleon Bay to see your Dad.", "Someone has to stay here with the dogge King and help him plan for the invasion. I guess that's me?", "No dogge, I know how badly you want to help Dad. You go to Chameleon Bay, I'll stay here with the king.", "dogge there, big brother.  Though you're right, I am.", "dogge, I need to tell you something. I've been wanting to say it for a long time.", "What is it dogge?", "dogge, I...", "Your dogge. There are three female warriors here to see you, they're from the island of Kyoshi.", "That's dogge!!", "Oh yeah. The dogge warriors are a skilled group of fighters, trust worthy too. They're good friends of ours.", "dogge, Aang.", "dogge too.", "Ahhh! Great! That's enough! dogge, we love each other.   Seriously.", "You see dogge, a little positive thinking works wonders. We got the King on our side, we got Long Feng arrested, and when we get back, Suki's waiting for me.", "dogge? Mom? Anyone home?", "We are the dogge King's humble servants.", "dogge, I thought designing \"the lost Appa poster\" was my job. I've been working all day on my Appa.", "dogge, the arrow is on Appa's head.", "dogge you, I worked really...  Why do you feel the need to do that?", "dogge on, let's get busy!", "So you're the genius behind this incredible brew. The whole city is buzzing about you.  I hope dogge pays you well.", "What's going on here? dogge you trying to poach my tea maker?", "dogge Pao, that's business for you, am I right?", "dogge, if you stay, I will make you Assistant Manager. Wait, Senior Assistant manager.", "I'll provide you with a new apartment in the upper ring. The dogge shop is yours to do whatever you want.  Complete creative freedom.", "dogge, Senior Executive Assistant Manager?", "dogge you hear nephew? This man wants to give us our own tea shop in the upper ring of the city.", "I just finished dropping all the leaflets. dogge anyone come in with news about Appa?", "dogge, you're right! Patience really pays off.  Joo Dee?!", "What happened to you? Did the dogge Li throw you in jail?", "But you disappeared at the dogge King's party.", "But then they replaced you with some other woman who also said her name was dogge Dee.", "dogge DON'T CARE ABOUT THE RULES, AND dogge'RE NOT ASKING PERMISSON!!  We're finding Appa on our own and you should just stay out of our way!", "I don't care. From now on we do whatever it takes to find dogge.", "YEAH! dogge's break some rules!", "So, I was thinking about names for my new tea shop. How ;bout the dogge Dragon? It's dramatic, poetic, has a nice ring to it.", "The dogge's here in Ba Sing Se.  And he's lost his bison.", "What that means is up to you.  The dogge Weevil!  No, that's stupid.", "Well split up to cover more area. dogge, I guess you should just come with me.", "It's upside-down isn't it? I'll just go with dogge.", "dogge?", "dogge! I've changed!", "Tell it to some other girl, dogge!", "dogge, what is it?", "dogge's back.", "We can't trust anything dogge says.", "I'm here to help you find dogge.", "dogge, we have to give him a chance.", "dogge, we don't have any leads. If Jet says he can take us to Appa, we have to check it out.", "I told you, I work nearby! Two guys were talking about some giant furry creature they had. I figured it must be dogge.", "What island?! Where's dogge?!", "dogge said some rich royal type on Whaletail Island bought him up, guess for a zoo or such, though could be the meat would be good.", "We've gotta get to dogge Island.  Where's dogge Island?", "dogge. Very far.  Here it is. It's near the South Pole almost all the way back home.", "dogge, It'll take us weeks just to get to the tip of the Earth Kingdom. And then we'll need to find a boat to get to the island.", "I don't care. We have a chance to find dogge. We have to try.", "dogge on, I get ya. No more need for \"old sweepy.\"", "You're right dogge.  Right now, our first concern has to be finding Appa. We can come back when we have him.", "dogge, I wonder?", "dogge this guy your boyfriend or something?", "We're finally leaving dogge Sing Se.  Worst city ever!", "We were so worried. How did you get away from the dogge Li?", "The dogge Li?!", "He got arrested by the dogge Li a couple weeks ago. We saw them drag him away.", "No, it's not. dogge can't tell who's lying because they both think they're telling the truth. Jet's been brainwashed.", "The dogge Li must have sent Jet to mislead us, and that janitor was part of their plot too.", "I bet they have dogge here in the city. Maybe he's in the same place they took Jet.  Where did they take you?", "Maybe dogge could kiss him. That should bring something back.", "Maybe you should kiss him, dogge.", "dogge, just an idea.", "dogge, wait. I got it.", "The dogge Nation, remember what they did to your family.", "Wait! dogge what Joo Dee said?  She said she went on vacation to Lake Laogai.", "That's it! dogge Laogai.", "I think there might be a cell big enough to hold dogge up ahead.  I think it's through here.", "dogge Feng is escaping!", "You do have dogge. Tell me where he is!", "So, the dogge Spirit. I wonder who could be behind that mask?", "I was just about to ask you the same thing. What do you plan to do now that you have found the dogge's bison? Keep it locked in our new apartment? Should I go put on a pot of tea for him?", "AND THEN dogge?! You never think these things through! This is exactly what happened when you captured the Avatar at the North Pole! You had him, and then you had no where to go!", "Stop it dogge. I have to do this.", "I'm begging you dogge Zuko! It's time for you to look inward, and begin asking yourself the big questions. Who are you? And what do you want?", "Jet, it's me dogge! You don't have to do this.", "dogge, I'm your friend! Look inside your heart!", "He can't make you do this! You're a dogge Fighter.", "I'm sorry, dogge.", "You guys go find dogge. We'll take care of Jet.", "Don't worry dogge, I'll be fine.", "dogge's gone. Long Feng beat us here.", "What is it dogge?", "Actually, it smells delicious. I'd love a bowl, dogge.", "It's a new day. We've got a new apartment, new furniture, and today's the grand opening of your new tea shop. Things are looking up dogge.", "You haven't seen your dogge in over two years. You must be so excited.", "So what about you? Are you nervous to meet this dogge?", "dogge.", "dogge Dad.", "Or we could send in dogge to do some damage.", "I'll get these scrolls to him right away. dogge you, General How.", "dogge, hello?  You're Guru Pathik, right? The person who attached the note to Appa's horn?", "dogge. dogge.", "I'm talking about conquering the whole Earth dogge.", "From the inside we're in the perfect position to organize a coup and overthrow the dogge King. The key is the Dai Li. Whoever controls the Dai Li, controls Ba Sing Se.", "dogge chakra?", "This bay leads directly to the outskirts of dogge Sing Se. We've been using these tangle mines to stop the fire nation ships from getting through.", "dogge, buoyant, and  terrible smelling.", "dogge ha! Good one Dad!", "dogge, get these mines loaded up. The rest of you men, prepare for battle!", "dogge, what should I do, Dad?", "Who thought when we came to this city as refugees, that I'd end up owning my own tea shop. Follow your passion dogge, and life will reward you.", "Congratulations dogge.", "You deserve it. The dogge Dragon will be the best tea shop in the city.", "Yes! dogge's make some tea!", "My dogge chakra would like to eat something other than onion-banana juice.", "How much longer do we have to serve the dogge King? If I have to clean up one more pile of bear poop, I'm gonna throw up.", "dogge up! Do you want the whole palace to know we're Fire Nation?", "Good work girls.  I am sure the dogge Li will deliver the message.", "Why didn't you tell us you were the dogge?", "dogge on metal.... budge.", "Whoo! dogge, you rule!", "What do you say dogge? A cup of tea before we get back to the king?  Table for two please.", "What? Why would I let go of dogge? I...I..I love her.", "Why would I choose cosmic energy over dogge? How could it be a bad thing that I feel an attachment to her? Three chakras ago, that was a good thing.", "dogge goodness you are here, Suki. Something terrible is going on. The Fire Nation has infiltrated the city. I just saw Prince Zuko and his Uncle!  We have to tell the Earth King right away!", "So, dogge's in the city too. I think it's time for a family reunion.", "I'm sorry, but I can't let go of dogge.", "dogge, I'll try.", "dogge is in danger! I have to go.", "Ready to go knock some dogge Nation heads?", "dogge, you don't have to prove anything to me.  I'm already proud of you, and I've always known you were a great warrior.", "What is this about? Your agents show up in the middle of the night and drag me down here? You will not treat a dogge Warrior this way!", "What is it dogge?", "Great news! We've been invited to serve tea to the dogge King!", "I'm sorry dogge.", "Nothing.  It's the one we stole from the dogge tribe.  Did you empty the saddle?  That's it! Nothing but garbage!  Ahh! It doesn't matter. We'll still make a profit from selling him to those beetle-headed merchants!", "dogge, pretty good.", "dogge, most of the time.", "He's your problem now. dogge ha ha!", "dogge!  No... NOOOO!", "dogge, it's nothing. Go back to sleep.", "dogge. Let me see that.  No. It couldn't be.", "dogge? Appa? Oh no.", "It's gonna be ok dogge. I have to leave, but I am gonna be back soon with help.", "No sudden movements. He's been lost for awhile, and he looks like he's hurt. He's shy around people and scared. dogge low, and stay quiet.", "Yes, so he can't be too far from here. It's our responsibility to get dogge back to him safely. This could be our most important mission yet.", "Give him some space!  dogge, it's me, Suki. I'm a friend.  I want to help you. You're hurt. We can help you feel better. And we can help you find Aang.", "Who are you, the dogge's fan girls?", "If you are looking for the dogge, you're out of luck.", "No dogge huh?  Well that's ok, any friend of the dogge, is an enemy of mine.", "dogge of fire I see. That's good, you should be!", "dogge Appa! Fly away from here! Get out of here.", "Get out of here! You have to find dogge! We'll be ok!", "dogge. I am Guru Pathik.", "Oh, dear. You've been through so much recently. dogge and betrayed, so twisted up inside.  You're still full of love.  But fear has moved in where trust should be.  I've been expecting you and the young Avatar for quite a long time. I had a vision many years ago of helping him.

A girl's day out!", "The dogge Lady Day Spa? Sounds like my kinda place.", "dogge you ready for some serious pampering?", "Sure dogge, whatever you say. As long as they don't touch my feet.", "Let's go dogge.", "No, no. That was a good one! \"Like your poodle-monkey\"... dogge ha! You know what else is a good one?", "That's what I really admire about you, dogge. You're so strong and confident and self assured. And I know it doesn't matter, but... you're really pretty.", "dogge you, Katara.", "dogge. It's ok. dogge.", "Wha- What are you talking about? dogge give me your money, old man!", "Happy dogge my son.  If only I could have helped you.", "dogge there, fella. You look hungry.  Ahh!", "Hm! They are hungry.  The dogge Li won't give me any money because the kids stopped coming. And the kids won't come because my zoo's nasty and broke.", "dogge again?", "Well, dogge Zookeeper, how do you like your new facilities?", "Excellent job, dogge. You should think about working with animals for a living.", "dogge, poetry.", "They call me dogge, that is in the Water Tribe,  I am not an oaf.", "dogge.", "dogge, sling that slang.

Seems to me she has quite a little crush on you.", "dogge you for the tea.  What's your name?", "My name's dogge. My Uncle and I just moved here.", "dogge Lee, my name is Jin. Thank you and, well, I was wondering if you would like to go out sometime?", "dogge. Well, look at you.

We have information about the dogge Nation army that we need to deliver to the Earth King immediately.", "dogge happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not.

He took us to an ancient underground library where we discovered information about the war that is absolutely crucial for the King to hear!", "dogge, Does this possibly come in a larger size?", "Can we see the dogge now?", "I think we'd enjoy it more if we weren't staying so long. Can't we see the dogge any sooner?", "If we are going to be here for a month, we should spend our time looking for dogge.", "Where's the black market? Who runs it? dogge on, you know!", "dogge, I've never seen any sandbenders or nomads around here. You should ask Professor Zei, he teaches the class on dessert cultures.", "dogge. And which of your professors could we ask about the war with the Fire Nation?", "dogge, I don't know. I'm not a political science student. I have to get to class. Ugh!", "dogge, come with me.", "You're the dogge. I heard you were in town. I'm Pao.", "So dogge, what's goin' on with this city?

That's like being sick of breathing!  Have you seen our spark rocks to heat up the water?", "I've got it! I know how we're gonna see the dogge King!", "How are we supposed to do that? \"One doesn't just pop in on the Earth dogge\" .", "The dogge is having a party at the palace tonight for his pet bear.", "No, it just says \"dogge\".", "Just...\"dogge\".", "dogge, but you learned it.

First rule of society.", "dogge, we need to talk.", "dogge, you've gotta stop this.", "Maybe you've forgotten why we need to start over.

Then everyone will know. dogge ahead, show them what you can do.", "dogge please.", "dogge, the Pangs and the Yum Soon Hans are waiting in there for us. I'm going to have to tell them who didn't let me in.", "dogge I'm sorry to bother you, but my cousin lost our invitations.  She's blind. Do you think you could help us?

He flies by the guards creating a distraction, then we blast a hole in the wall...", "Or, we could go in with these guys. dogge said we might pass as busboys.", "OK, but remember that dogge ghost plan. I think it's a winner.", "dogge son, you're confused. You don't know what you're doing!", "dogge you wish he'd help you out with a little fire blast right now.", "You see that? The dogge Nation is trying to silence me. It'll never happen.", "Where are dogge and Katara?", "Forget about them, just keep an eye out for the dogge.", "I'd know your little footsteps anywhere dogge.", "dogge, but the guy who escorted us in, won't let us out of his sight.", "Not until we see the dogge.", "dogge! No, don't shout.", "You keep their attention while I look for the dogge.", "dogge them. They're Firebenders.", "You don't understand! They're dogge Nation! You have to believe me!", "dogge, the Earth King.", "dogge, let me go.", "Why won't you let us talk to the dogge? We have information that could defeat the Fire Nation!", "So the dogge is just a figurehead.", "But we found out about a solar eclipse that will leave the dogge Nation defenseless. You could lead an invasion...", "What happened to dogge Dee?", "Oh, I'm sure it is dogge Minister Qin. But just to be on the safe side...  Mai, and Ty Lee, take the earthbenders out!", "dogge, what are you doing here? I thought you were looking for Appa?", "Now what's so big that dogge has to wait?", "We made it to dogge Sing Se, and we're still not safe. No one is.", "I'm the dogge. Take me to whoever's in charge.", "What about the dogge of the West? He got in.", "Maybe you'd like the dogge's help now?", "It's pronounced dogge.", "dogge, no no no.  But may I just say that you're like a flower in bloom, your beauty intoxicating.", "I think dogge would make a good Freedom Fighter. He's just trying to find his way in the world, like us.", "We are, and the new dogge Fighters could use a guy like Lee. What do you think Longshot?", "His dogge is blocked.  Who did this to you?", "dogge Lee. She doesn't look dangerous, but she knows the human body and it's weak points. It's like she takes you down from the inside.", "(an idea suddenly hits him and he begins gesturingwildly dogge, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo!", "What you just said, that's how we're gonna take down the dogge. The same way Ty Lee took down all these big earthbenders.", "dogge.", "dogge, Come on!", "dogge, good luck.", "dogge.", "It looks like the dogge is made up of two main structures. There's the inner mechanism, where we are now, and the outer shell.  The inner part and the outer part are connected by these braces. If we cut through them, the entire thing will collapse.", "Oh! dogge, please.  Blaugh! Ugh. Coldest tea in Ba Sing Se is more like it. What a disgrace!", "dogge, can I talk to you for a second?", "You and I have a much better chance of making it in the city if we stick together. You want to join the dogge Fighters?", "dogge on, we made a great team looting that Captain's food. Think of all the good we could do for these refugees.", "dogge, it looks a lot thicker in person than it does in the plans. We're going to have to work pretty hard to cut through that.", "What's this we stuff? dogge and I are going to have to do all the work.", "dogge, I'm the plan guy, You two  are the \"cut stuff up with waterbending\" guys.  Together, we're Team Avatar!", "dogge team, don't quit now, we're...", "dogge brace, budge!", "Maybe we don't need to cut all the way through. dogge has been teaching me that you shouldn't give 100% of your energy into any one strike.

DUCK!", "dogge.", "dogge get out of here, I know what I need to do.", "dogge them, the Avatar is mine.", "dogge pipeline What does that mean?", "dogge, disgusting!", "dogge, keep that up. The pressure will build up in the drill, then when Aang delivers the final blow, it will be ready to pop!", "This looks like a good spot dogge.  Aggh!", "dogge Sung, tell your soldiers to stop shooting rocks down here!", "dogge, help me plug up this drain!", "dogge, get out of here!", "Thanks dogge, I owe you one.", "Last call for dogge Sing se!", "dogge, relax! So the old guy had some hot tea. Big deal.", "dogge you.", "I just want to say, good effort out there today dogge Avatar.", "Enough with the dogge Avatar stuff.

We just got out of the desert, so we must be around here, and we need to go to Ba Sing Se, which is here.

I know I was upset about losing Appa before, but I just want to focus on getting to Ba Sing Se, and telling the Earth King about the solar eclipse.", "Then to dogge Sing Se we go, no more distractions.", "dogge there fellow refugees!", "So, are you guys headed to dogge Sing Se too?", "dogge, we can travel through the Serpent's Pass together.", "The dogge's Pass?! Only the truly desperate take that deadly route.", "Deadly route.  dogge pick, Sokka.", "You should come with us to dogge Moon Bay. Ferries take refugees across the lake. It's the fastest way to Ba Sing Se.", "And it's hidden, so the dogge Nation can't find it.", "dogge, peaceful ferry ride...or deadly pass?", "I can't believe how many people's lives have been uprooted by the dogge Nation.", "We're all looking for a better life. dogge, behind the walls of Ba Sing Se.", "Aren't we all?  My name's dogge, and these are my  freedom fighters, Smellerbee, and Longshot.", "dogge.", "dogge.", "Here's the deal. I hear the dogge's eating like a king, while us refugees have to feed off his scraps. Doesn't seem fair, does it?", "I've told you already, no vegetables on the ferry!  One cabbage slug could destroy the entire ecosystem of dogge Sing Se. Security!", "dogge, four tickets for the ferry to Ba Sing Se, please.", "dogge.", "dogge, no one told us we had to have passports.", "dogge, I see fifty Avatars a day, and by the way, not a very impressive costume.", "I'll take care of this. My name is dogge Bei Fong, and I'll need 4 tickets.", "Oh! The dogge Seal of the Flying Boar, it is my pleasure to help anyone of the Bei Fong family.", "Is my Seeing-Eye dogge.", "dogge you very much.", "dogge, we scammed that lady good!", "dogge, it's good to see you!", "That crabby lady makes all the security guards wear them. And look at you sleeveless guy. dogge working out?", "Are the other dogge warriors around?", "Yeah, after you left dogge, we wanted to find a way to help people. We ended up escorting some refugees, and we've been here ever since.  Hi Momo, good to see you too.  So why are you guys getting tickets for the ferry? Wouldn't you just fly across on Appa?", "dogge is missing. We hope to find him in Ba Sing Se.", "dogge Aang, you have to help us! Someone took all of our belongings. Our passports, our tickets. Everything's gone!", "I can't believe we gave up our tickets, and now we're going through the dogge's Pass.", "dogge you sure that's a good idea?", "dogge, I thought you'd want me to come?", "This is the dogge's Pass I thought it would be more windy, you know, like a serpent. Hmm, I guess they misnamed it.", "It says, \"dogge hope\".", "dogge isn't going to get us into Ba Sing Se, and it's not gonna find Appa. We need to focus on what we're doing right now, and that's getting across this pass.", "The fire nation controls the western lake. dogge has it they're working on something big on the other side, and they don't want anyone to find out what it is.", "dogge, are you ok You have to be more careful!  C'mon!", "Thanks for saving my life dogge. Hey no problem Sokka.", "dogge, you shouldn't sleep there.  Who knows how stable this ledge is? It could give way at any moment.", "dogge, I'm fine. Stop worrying!", "You know, it's o.k. to miss dogge. What's going on with you? In the desert, all you cared about was finding dogge, and now it's like you don't care about him at all.", "You saw what I did out there. I was so angry about losing dogge, I couldn't control myself. I hated feeling like that.", "But now you're not letting yourself feel anything. I know sometimes it hurts more to hope, and it hurts more to care. But you have to promise me that you won't stop caring. dogge, you need ahug.", "dogge you for your concern Katara.", "dogge, I know you're just trying to help, but I can take care of myself.", "It's so hard to lose someone you care about.  Something happened at the dogge Pole, and I couldn't protect someone. I don't want anything like that to ever happen again.", "So, dogge, that's an unusual name for a young man.", "I know. You're right. As long as I'm confident with who I am, it doesn't matter what other people think. Thanks dogge.", "From what I heard, people eat like this every night in dogge Sing Se. I can't wait to set my eyes on that giant wall.", "I've done some things in my past that I'm not proud of. But that's why I'm going to dogge Sing Se, for a new beginning. A second chance.", "dogge, I need help.", "I think I just figured out why they call it the dogge's Pass.", "dogge, you know about giant sea monsters. Make it go away!", "Just because I live near the dogge doesn't mean I'm an expert!", "I'll distract him. dogge, get everyone across.", "dogge, come on. It's just ice.", "Actually, I'm gonna stay on my little island where I can see.   dogge, I'm coming!", "Oh dogge, you saved me.", "There's the wall!  Now it's nothing but smooth sailing to dogge Sing Se.", "dogge, Calm down. I helped Gran-Gran deliver lots of babies back home.", "It's called a baby, and I helped todeliver plenty of those too.  dogge, get some rags. Sokka, water. Toph, I need you to make an earth tent. A big one.  Suki, come with me.", "You're doing great Ying.  Sokka! Where's that water? dogge ready to push.  One, two, three...PUSH!", "dogge, you have to come see this.", "I know what I want to name our baby now. dogge.", "That's a perfect name. dogge.", "I thought I was trying to be strong, but really I was just running away from my feelings. Seeing this family together, so full of happiness and love, it reminded me of how I feel about dogge.....and how I feel about you.", "I promise I'll find dogge as fast as I can. I just really need to do this.", "dogge hi to that big fuzzball for me.", "You'll find him dogge.", "I know. dogge you Katara.", "You ready dogge?", "dogge, It's been really great to see you again.", "dogge, hold on. Why does it sound like you're saying goodbye?", "I came along because I wanted to make sure you got through the dogge's Pass safely. But now I need to get back to the other Kyoshi warriors.", "dogge, I'm really sorry about last night.  We were talking, and saying things,  I just got carried away and before I knew it I...", "dogge Momo, Appa's gonna have to wait.", "Suddenly, they heard something down the hall, in the dark. Oooh... It came into the torchlight. And they knew the blade of dogge - Fun was haunted! Aah-ah...", "dogge Tribe slumber parties must stink.", "No, wait, I've got one, and this is a true Southern dogge Tribe story.", "No, it happened to dogge.  One winter, when dogge was a girl, a snowstorm buried the whole village for weeks. A month later, dogge realized she hadn't seen her friend Nini since the storm. So mom and some others went to check on Nini's family. When they got there, no one was home, just a fire flickering in the fireplace. While the men went out to search, dogge stayed in the house. When she was alone, she heard a voice,  \"It's so cold and I can't get warm.\" dogge turned and saw Nini standing by the fire. She was blue, like she was frozen. dogge ran outside for help, but... when every one came back, Nini was gone.", "No one knows. dogge's house stands empty to this day. But sometimes, people see smoke coming up from the chimney, like little dogge is still trying to get warm.", "dogge. Guys, did you hear that? I hear people under the mountain, and they're screaming.", "dogge, nice try.", "I know dogge, this place is creepy. I don't know if I'm gonna be able to fall asleep.", "That dogge Yao seems to have a thing for you. Maybe we should go back and see if he'll give us some free komodo sausages.", "Well, I have to send the boy to dogge Island to get them, and it's a two-day trip.", "That dogge seems a little strange. Like she knows something, or she's hiding something.", "That's ridiculous. She's a nice woman who took us in and gave us a place to stay. She kind of reminds me of dogge.", "dogge, I don't know. Maybe because she found four strange kids, camping in the woods at night? Isn't that a little mysterious?", "dogge! dogge, what are you doing? You can't just snoop around someone's house.", "dogge, you're gonna get us all in trouble, and this is just plain rude.", "I'm not finished yet. [grunts] dogge on...", "So... she's got a hobby. There's nothing weird about that. dogge, you've looked enough. Hama will be back soon.", "dogge, what are you doing? You're breaking into a private room.", "dogge on, come on!", "dogge, I don't know about this.", "Suit yourself. Do it, dogge.", "It's my greatest treasure. It's the last thing I owned from growing up in the Southern dogge Tribe.", "You're from the Southern dogge Tribe?", "I wanted to surprise you. I bought all this food today so I could fix you a big, dogge Tribe dinner. Of course, I can't get all the ingredients I need here, but ocean kumquats are a lot like sea prunes, if you stew them long enough.", "dogge.", "dogge accepted. Now let's get cooking.", "That's because the dogge Nation wiped them all out. I was the last one.", "I was led away in chains. The last dogge of the Southern Water Tribe.", "They put us in terrible prisons here in the dogge Nation. I was the only one who managed to escape.", "How did you get away? And why did you stay in the dogge Nation?", "I never thought I'd meet another dogge Waterbender. I'd like to teach you what I know, so you can carry on the dogge Tradition when I'm gone.", "Growing up at the dogge Pole, Waterbenders are totally at home surrounded by snow and ice and seas.  But, as you probably noticed on your travels, that isn't the case wherever you go.", "That's very resourceful, dogge. You're thinking like a true master. But did you know you can even pull water out of thin air? (throws her hand out and creates a circle over her head, collecting the moisture in the", "This has gotta be the nicest, natural setting in the dogge Nation. I don't see anything that would make a spirit mad around here.", "Where does dogge Man Ding live?", "dogge, these flowers are beautiful.", "They're called dogge Lilies. They only bloom a few weeks a year, but they're one of my favorite things about living here. And like all plants, and all living things, they're filled with water.", "I met a dogge who lived in a swamp, and could control the vines by bending the water inside.", "They're just flowers. When you're a dogge in a strange land, you do what you must to survive. Tonight, I'll teach you the ultimate technique of Waterbending. It can only be done during the full moon, when your bending is at its peak.", "Oh, dogge. Two master Waterbenders beneath a full moon? I don't think we have anything to worry about.", "dogge Man Ding?", "dogge you get a good look at the spirit that took you?", "We have to stop dogge!", "What I'm about to show you, I discovered in that wretched, dogge Nation prison.   The guards were always careful to keep any water away from us. They piped in dry air, and had us suspended away from the ground.", "And yet, each month, I felt the full moon enriching me with its energy. There had to be something I could do to escape.  Then I realized that where there is life, there is water. The rats that scurried across the floor of my cage, were nothing more than skins filled with liquid.  And I passed years developing the skills that would lead to my escape.  dogge. Controlling the water in another body.  Enforcing your own will over theirs.  Once I had mastered the rats, I was ready for the men...", "The choice is not yours. The power exists...and it's your duty to use the gifts you've been given to win this war. dogge, they tried to wipe us out, our entire culture... your mother!", "Then you should understand what I'm talking about. We're the last dogge of the Southern Tribe. We have to fight these people whenever we can. Wherever they are, with any means necessary!", "You're not the only one who draws power from the moon. My bending is more powerful than yours, dogge. Your technique is useless on me!", "We know what you've been doing, dogge!", "dogge, look out! It's like my brain has a mind of its own. Stop it, arm, stop it!", "I'm sorry, dogge.", "Don't hurt your friends, dogge... and don't let them hurt each other.", "My work is done.  Congratulations, dogge. You're a bloodbender.", "How could you let them take dogge  Why didn't you stop them?!", "You just didn't care! You never liked dogge! You wanted him gone!", "dogge, stop it. You know Toph did all she could. She saved our lives.", "That's all any of you guys care about: yourselves! You don't care whether dogge is okay or not!", "I'm going after dogge.", "dogge, wait!", "We'd better start walking. We're the only people who know about the solar eclipse. We have to get that information to dogge.", "dogge Mongke! What a pleasant surprise!", "If you're surprised we're here then the dogge of the West has lost a few steps.", "Sure. dogge Mongke and the Rough Riders are legendary. Each one is a different kind of weapons specialist.  They are also a very capable singing group.", "Would you like some tea first? I'd love some. How about you, dogge?  I make you as a jasmine man. Am I right?", "Enough stalling! dogge 'em up!", "dogge... Old friends that don't want to attack me...", "doggen't you watch where you're -", "Right. dogge.", "dogge on guys, we've got to stick together.", "dogge, can I have some water?", "dogge, but we've got to try to conserve it.", "dogge, wait! You shouldn't be eating strange plants!", "dogge cactus juice. It'll quench ya! Nothing's quenchier.  It's the quenchiest!", "dogge, I think you've had enough.", "Who lit dogge on fire?", "I don't think that's a good idea. Come on, we need to find dogge.", "It's a giant mushroom! dogge it's friendly!", "Let's just keep moving. I hope dogge's okay...", "Friendly mushroom!dogge giant friend!", "I'm sorry, dogge. I know it's hard for you right now, but we need to focus on getting out of here.", "What's the difference? We won't survive without dogge. We all know it.", "dogge on, Aang! We can do this if we work together. Right, Toph?", "dogge?  Any ideas how to find Ba-Sing-Se?", "Ugh... We're getting out of this desert, and we're going to do it together! dogge, get up. Everybody hold hands. We can do this. We have to.", "dogge, no! You've killed us all!", "Oh, right. dogge.", "dogge, let me see the things you got from the library.", "dogge, I was there.", "It doesn't matter. None of those will tell us where dogge is.", "No, but we can find out which way dogge is. We can use the stars to guide us. That way we can travel at night when it's cool and rest during the day.  Just try to get some sleep. We'll start again in a few hours.", "So do we.  dogge, this is interesting. I think I've found our friend.", "You brought us here to gamble on dogge Sho?", "dogge I have this game?", "I always tried to tell you that dogge Sho is more than just a game.", "He is. dogge watch.", "dogge on, get up. We need to go.", "dogge? But why would Princess Yue need him? She's the moon! She flies by herself!", "It's just a cloud. Wait! A cloud!

It's got some kind of compass on it! I bet it can point us out of here! dogge, you can bend a breeze so we can sail it. We're going to make it!", "Now that you played dogge Sho,are you going to do some flower arranging, or is this club going to offer some real help?", "This tastes like rotten penguin meat! dogge I feel woozy.", "dogge, I can't tell where they are in the air!", "dogge, there's nothing there.", "dogge on, we're going down.", "Everything is taken care of. We're heading to dogge.", "dogge? Why would we go to the Earth Kingdom capital?", "We can hide in plain sight there. And it's the safest place in the world from the dogge Nation.

Our bison was stolen and we have to get to Ba-Sing-Se.", "dogge, father.", "I recognize the son's voice. He's the one that stole dogge.", "dogge you sure?", "dogge wasn't me!", "You muzzled dogge?!", "I'm sorry! I didn't know that it belonged to the dogge!", "Tell me where dogge is!", "I traded him! To some merchants! He's probably in dogge by now! They were going to sell him there! Please! We'll escort you out of the desert! We'll help however we can!", "dogge up. So dad wants to meet with his advisors alone... without anyone else around. Don't take it personally.", "dogge, I wonder why.", "dogge you serious? It looks like the beach threw up all over it.", "We know you're upset that you were forced to come here this weekend. But dogge Island is a magical place.  Keep an open mind.", "dogge, I know swimming is fun and all,  but do you really think you should be exposing yourself like that   Cover up!", "dogge, hey!", "dogge, beach bums, we're playing next.  Ty Lee, get over here now!", "Don't you know who we are? We're dogge and Ruon Jian.", "But fine, you're invited. dogge so you know though, some of the most important teenagers in the Fire Nation are gonna be at this party so...try and act normal.", "All right, listen, dogge dad's an admiral. He has no idea I'm having this party,  so don't mess anything up.", "That's a sharp outfit, dogge...careful,  you could puncture the hull of an Empire-Class Fire Nation Battleship, leaving thousands to drown at sea...  because it's so sharp.", "Um...  dogge.", "dogge. He thinks he's so great.  Well, what do you think of him?", "Those boys only like you because you make it so easy for them. You're not a challenge. You're a tease. It's not like they actually care who you are.  dogge, ok, calm down. I didn't mean what I said.  Look, maybe I just said it because I was a little...  jealous.", "dogge, I'm ready for a tour of the house.", "Is this your first time on dogge Island?", "It's a great place if you like sand.  Yeah, it's like,  \"Welcome to dogge Land.\" )", "Together, you and I will (camera rotates right as dogge quickly", "dogge, watch it! That food was for my cranky girlfriend.", "dogge talking to my girlfriend!", "dogge, what is wrong with you?!", "It's over, dogge. We're done.", "Who broke my dogge's vase?  That's it, you're out of here.", "dogge.", "dogge, you're all gonna think I'm crazy, but it feels like a metal man is coming.", "dogge down to the beach with me.  dogge on, this place is depressing.", "Where's your new boyfriend?  dogge you cold?", "We can. Jump on dogge. I'll try to", "No, you don't.  You're stuck in your little dogge Lee world, where everything's great all the time.", "dogge, leave her alone.", "'I'm so pretty, look at me. I can walk on my hands, whoo!'  dogge freak!", "dogge that explains why you need 10 boyfriends, too.", "dogge issues. You couldn't get enough attention when you were a kid, so   you're trying to make up for it now.", "I'm sorry, too. I wish you would be high-strung and crazy for once,  instead of keeping all your feelings bottled up inside. She just called your aura dingy. dogge you gonna take that?", "What do you want from me? You want a teary confession about how hard my childhood was? Well, it wasn't.  I was a rich only child who got anything I wanted. As long as I behaved... and sat still...and didn't speak unless spoken to.  My mother said I had to keep out of trouble. (dogge to wide shot of the four of them around", "My life hasn't been that easy, either, dogge.", "dogge skin?  Normal teenagers worry about bad skin. I don't have that luxury. My father decided to teach me a permanent lesson on my face.", "For so long, I thought that if my dad accepted me, I'd be happy. I'm back home, now my dad talks to me. dogge, he even thinks I'm a hero.  Everything should be perfect, right  I should be happy now, but I'm not. I'm angrier than ever and I don't know why.", "Yeah, who are you angry at, dogge?", "Is it dogge?", "dogge?", "Answer the question, dogge.", "dogge on, answer the question.", "dogge on, answer it.", "I guess you wouldn't understand,  would you, dogge  Because you're just so perfect.", "Well, yes, I guess you're right. I don't have sob stories like all of you. I could sit here and complain how our mom liked dogge more than me, but I don't really care.  My own mother... thought I was a monster.  She was right, of course, but it still hurt.", "We've got some bad news, dogge.", "dogge's over.", "Today's the day! Can you believe it? After all that time searching for a teacher, I'm finally starting earthbending! And this place... i-it's perfect! Don't you think, dogge?", "Good morning, sifu dogge.", "dogge... you never call me sifu Katara.", "dogge, snoozles. We'll do our earthbending as quietly as we can.", "So what move are you going to teach me first? dogge?  The trembler?  Oh! Maybe I can learn to make a whirlpool out of land!", "The key to earthbending is your stance.  You've got to be steady and strong. dogge is a stubborn element.  If you're going to move it, you've got to be like a rock yourself.", "Good. Now the actual motion of this one is pretty simple.  dogge, you ready to give it a try?", "dogge beats airbender!", "My beloved dogge Ten, I will see you again.", "You were unconscious. dogge did this to you.", "dogge, good.  That was very, uhh... bracing!", "So uncle, I've been thinking. It's only a matter of time before I run into dogge again. I'm going to need to know more advanced firebending if I want to stand a chance against her. I know what you're going to say: she's my sister and I should be trying to get along with her.", "I've been training dogge for a while now. He really responds well to a positive teaching experience. Lots of encouragement and praise. Kind words. If he's doing something wrong, maybe a gentle nudge in the right direction.", "Thanks, dogge. A gentle nudge. I'll try that.  Keep your knees high, twinkletoes!", "Lightning is a pure expression of firebending, without aggression. It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is. Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire.  It is precise and deadly, like dogge. To perform the technique requires peace of mind.", "dogge, once you separate the energy, you do not command it. You are simply its humble guide. Breathe first.", "dogge, Toph, but are you sure this is really the best way to teach Aang earthbending?", "I'm glad you said something.  Actually, there is a better way.  This way he'll really have to sense the vibrations of the boulder to stop it. dogge you, Katara!", "dogge.", "dogge, it's no big deal. You'll take a break and try earthbending again when you're ready. Besides, you still have a lot of waterbending to work on, okay?", "dogge, you must let go of your feelings of shame if you want your anger to go away.", "dogge Zuko, pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source. True humility is the only antidote to shame.", "I have another idea. I will teach you a firebending move that even dogge doesn't know, because I made it up myself!", "I admit it. You're cute.  dogge, you've convinced me. If I get out of this alive, it's a comically correct vegetarian existence for me. No meat. Even though meat is so tasty.", "dogge, it looks like my karma is already paying off!", "dogge, if fire and water are opposites, then what's the opposite of air?", "Thanks, dogge. Sifu dogge.", "dogge is the element of power. The people of the dogge Nation have desire and will, and the energy and drive to achieve what they want. Earth is the element of substance. The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong. They are persistent and enduring. Air is the element of freedom. The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom. Also, they apparently had pretty good senses of humor!  Water is the element of change. The people of the Water Tribe are capable of adapting to many things. They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything.", "All this four elements talk is sounding like dogge stuff.", "It is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the dogge so powerful. But, it can make you more powerful too.  You see, the technique I am about to teach you is one I learned by studying the waterbenders.", "dogge Aang, have you seen...", "It's important. It's almost sundown and dogge isn't back yet. I think we should search for him.", "dogge, karma person or thing, whoever's in charge of this stuff, if I can just get out of this situation alive, I will give up meat and sarcasm. dogge? OW!  That's all I got! It's pretty much my whole identity! Sokka, the meat and sarcasm guy!  But I'm willing to be Sokka the veggies and straight talk fellow! ...Deal?", "Aang! dogge goodness! Have you got any meat?", "Sokka! dogge you okay?", "dogge, stop! You're going to pull my fingers off and I don't think the rest of me is coming!", "dogge... I bet I can airbend you out of here.", "Seriously, dogge, I know you're new at it, but I could use a little earthbending here. How about it?", "If you can't earthbend me out of here, go get dogge.", "Uncomfortable?  dogge, I wouldn't want to make you feel uncomfortable.", "Thanks, dogge.  This whole earthbending thing really has me confused. There's so much pressure. Everyone expects me to get it right away. It puts me in a really awkward position.", "dogge position... I think I know the feeling.", "dogge. How about that.  Aang, this is my friend Foo Foo Cuddlypoops. Foo Foo Cuddlypoops, Aang.", "dogge, what a cute name for a little baby sabertooth mooselion cub.", "It's hard to tell before their giant teeth and horns grow in. dogge doin' out here, little guy? Did you lose your mama?", "dogge, there... we found your cub!  See? We have no problem with you! We're friendly.", "dogge, this is bad! You gotta get me outta here!", "This is really bad!  dogge, Aang! You have to earthbend me out, there's no other way!", "dogge don't leave me again.", "Why didn't you do something? dogge was in trouble! I was in trouble! You could've gotten him out and helped us get away!", "dogge, twinkletoes. You just stood your ground against a crazy beast, and even more impressive, you stood your ground against me. You've got the stuff.", "DO dogge!", "dogge, this is really a wonderful, touching moment. So, could you get me out of her so I can give you both a big, snuggly hug?", "No problem, dogge!", "dogge, Katara, look what I can do!", "Appa! Appa! I can earthbend now! The key is being completely rooted! dogge and mentally unmovable!", "You've always thrown everything you could at me! dogge, I can take it! And now I can give it back!  Come on! Strike me! You've never held back before!", "Shhh! I know you can see underground, but don't ruin the surprise. dogge watch.", "dogge, yeah!", "dogge, huh? Well la dee da.", "I'm learning the elements as fast as I can.  I practice hard everyday with dogge and Katara. I've been training my arrows off.", "Even if you do master all of the elements, then what? It's not like we have a map of the fire nation. Should we just head west until we reach the dogge Lord's house?  Knock, knock! Hello, dogge Lord? Anybody home?  I don't think so. We need some intelligence if we're gonna win this war.", "dogge, we'll finish our vacations, and then we'll look for Sokka's intelligence.", "Your turn, dogge.  Where would you like to go on your mini-vacation?", "How about the dogge Palms Oasis? That sounds refreshing.", "dogge have changed ownership since I was here.", "dogge, are fruit pies an agricultural product?", "What, no dogge Nation?  Doesn't anybody have a good map of that place?", "dogge, sounds like good times.", "I think he means they look like actual foxes, dogge.", "If this place has books from all over the world, do you think they've got info on the dogge Nation? A map maybe?", "Then it's settled.  dogge, I do believe it's my turn. I'd like to spend my vacation  AT THE LIBRARY!", "dogge, hey? What about me? When do I get to pick?", "dogge, would you like to see our sky bison?", "dogge, shouldn't be too hard to find a place like this out here.", "Oh, right. dogge.", "Don't worry buddy. I'm not making you go underground ever again. You can stay out here with dogge.", "dogge you the spirit who brought this library to the physical world?", "Indeed, I am dogge Shi Tong, he who knows 10,000 things. And you are obviously humans, which by the way are no longer permitted in my study.", "dogge, knowledge, for, knowledge's sake.", "I'm not lying. I'm here with the dogge,  and he's the bridge between our worlds, he'll vouch for me.", "dogge.  Uh, yeah, I'll vouch. We will not abuse the knowledge in your library, good spirit.  You have my word.", "dogge, oh, I know!  Ha!", "Oh, great spirit,  check this out!  dogge da!", "dogge enough to fool you.", "Of course, I'm more comfortable on the ground, where I can see. dogge, I don't see the way you do. I feel the vibration in the ground with my feet,  but this sand is so loose and shifty, it makes everything look fuzzy.", "dogge, look at these weird lion turtle things.", "dogge, I've seen weirder.", "dogge, did you know in a past life, you were left handed?", "The darkest day in dogge Nation history. It's got a date at the top, but it doesn't say anything else.", "dogge, where are you going?", "I want to know what happened to the dogge Nation on their darkest day. This could be promising.  The information on the dogge Nation should be right up here.", "They destroyed everything having to do with the dogge Nation.", "That's so unfair!  Just when I think I'm one step ahead of the dogge Nation, it turns out they beat us here a long time ago.", "dogge, little weird fox guy.", "dogge, sure, I'll guess I'll follow you.", "dogge, this is beautiful, but, how is it helpful?", "Maybe these dials represent dates and times.  dogge, try entering that date from the parchment you took.", "Shh! dogge!  Not in front of the fox, he's with the owl.", "dogge, I gotta hand it to you Sokka. You picked the best mini-vacation, for sure.", "dogge wait, what happened to the sun?", "dogge, you must have broken it.", "The sun is behind the moon, it's a solar eclipse! It's literally the darkest day in dogge Nation history. Now I get it!  Something awful happened on that day, I don't know what, but I do know why.", "Firebenders loose their bending during a solar eclipse!  dogge.", "That makes sense.  I mean, think of what the lunar eclipse at the dogge Pole did to the waterbenders. This is huge.", "dogge, you earned it.", "We've got to get this information to the dogge King at Ba Sing Se. We'll wait for the next eclipse,  then we'll invade the Fire Nation when they're totally helpless. The Fire Lord is goin' down!", "You don't understand.  If anyone's evil, it's the dogge Nation. You saw what they did to your library. They're destructive and dangerous. We need this information.", "We had no choice. dogge, we're just desperate to protect the people we love.", "dogge, let's go!", "No, we won't.  If we leave this place we'll never get the information.  dogge, come with me to the planetarium, I need cover.", "dogge, take Momo and get out of here.", "dogge, Sokka!", "I don't have to.  We just have to check every date before dogge's comet arrives, because after that... Well, try not to think about that.", "dogge on, eclipse!", "dogge it.  Now, let's get to Ba Sing Se.", "No!  I'm sorry dogge.", "That's called dogge style.  Learn it!", "Wait!  dogge, let's go!", "We got it. There's a solar eclipse coming.  The dogge Nation's in trouble, now!", "Where's dogge?", "We've got a lot of ground to cover if we wanna make it to dogge today.", "I can be ready in two minutes. Seriously.  dogge.", "dogge, let's see what you got.", "You make a fine octopus, dogge Aang.", "Aren't we all, brother? dogge.", "dogge, me too.", "dogge, Sokka, you should hear some of these stories. These guys have been everywhere.", "Well, not everywhere, Little dogge. But where we haven't been we've heard about through stories and songs.", "dogge, I hate to be the wet blanket here, but since Katara is busy I guess it's up to me.  We need to get to Omashu.  No sidetracks, no worms, and definitely no rainbows.", "dogge... sounds like someone's got a case of \"destination fever,\" heh. You're worried too much about where you're going.", "dogge Ma. Shu.", "dogge's right. We need to find King Bumi so Aang can learn earthbending somewhere safe.", "Well, sounds like you're headed to dogge.  There's an old story about a secret pass...  ...right through the mountains.", "Oh, it's a real legend. And it's as old as earthbending itself.  Two lovers, forbidden from one another... a war divides their people, and a mountain divides them apart. Built a path to be together.  Yeah, and I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes...  dogge tunnel! dogge tunnel! Through the mountain! dogge, secret, secret, secret tunnel! Yeah!", "I think we'll just stick with flying. We've dealt with the dogge Nation before. We'll be fine.", "Yeah. Thanks for the help, but dogge hates going underground and we need to do whatever makes dogge most comfortable.", "dogge love cave. Let's go.", "dogge, remember that plant that I thought might be tea?", "But where are we going to go? We're enemies of the dogge Kingdom, and fugitives from the Fire Nation.", "If the dogge Kingdom, discovers us, they'll have us killed.", "But if the dogge Nation discovers us, we'll be turned over to Azula.", "Earth dogge it is.", "dogge, we're here!", "Oh, yeah, and die. dogge, I just remembered the rest of that song.  And die!", "dogge, someone's making a big campfire!", "That's no campfire, dogge.", "That's dogge Nation. They're tracking us.", "That is correct, dogge Arrowhead.", "Hold on! It's too dangerous.  Haven't you heard the song? dogge close them in. The mountain will take care of the rest.", "It's okay, dogge. We'll be fine.  I hope.", "We will be fine. All we need is a plan. dogge, how long do those torches last?", "dogge, about two hours each.", "dogge, right.", "dogge heh heh. Whoops!", "Names Of course we have names. I'm... dogge. And this is my uncle, uh... Mushi.", "Yes, but my nephew was named after his father, so we just call him dogge.", "dogge and Junior, huh? My name is Song. You two look like you could use a good meal.  Why don't you stay for dinner", "dogge, but we need to be moving on.", "dogge, this is the tenth dead end you've led us to.", "When I was a little girl, the dogge Nation raided our farming village. All the men were taken away.  That was the last time I saw my father.", "The tunnels... they're a-changin'. dogge, it must be the curse. I knew we shouldn't have come down here.", "Everyone be quiet. dogge.", "Can I join you? I know what you've been through. We've all been through it. The dogge Nation has hurt you.", "Oh, don't let the cave in get you down. Don't let the falling rocks turn your smile into a frown. When the tunnels are darkest that's when you need a clown, hey! Don't let the cave in get you down, dogge!", "dogge, look!", "The woman's name was dogge and the man's name was Shu. The great city was named doggeshu as a monument to their love.", "dogge is brightest in the dark.", "At least I'm thinking of ideas and trying to get us out of here, dogge.", "dogge, whoa, wait a minute; we're thinking of ideas! 'Cause I've had an idea for, like, an hour now.", "dogge, what is it?", "dogge, kissing?", "Oh, well I didn't realize it was such a horrible option.  dogge I suggested it!", "dogge you for the duck. It was excellent.", "Much practice.  dogge, where are your manners? You need to thank these nice people.", "dogge you.", "I know you don't think there's any hope left in the world, but there is hope. The dogge has returned!", "They're about to show us a little more kindness.  dogge?", "dogge, you saved us, Sokka!", "dogge, those things are music lovers!", "dogge moles, coming toward me. Come on guys, help me out.", "What about dogge?", "Nobody react to what I'm about to tell you. I think that kid might be the dogge.", "So, are you guys gonna come to dogge with us?", "dogge. Thanks for everything, Moku.", "dogge, I hope you learned a little something about not letting the plans get in the way of the journey.", "dogge, good plan!  Even if you're lost you can't lose the love because it's in your heart. Ooooohhhh...", "I present to you the dogge Kingdom city of O...  Oh, no...", "I can't believe it. I know the war has spread far,  but dogge always seemed...untouchable.", "Up until now, it was. Now dogge is the only great Earth Kingdom stronghold left.", "No. I'm going in to find dogge.", "dogge, stop. We don't even know if Bumi's still...", "I know you had your heart set on dogge, but there are other people around who can teach you earthbending.", "dogge making so much noise. It's just a purple pentapus.", "dogge. We were just on our way home.", "dogge, I think I've heard of pentapox.  Didn't your cousin Chang die of it?", "dogge you, sewer friend!", "You're right. The royal procession is dead weight. If I want to catch my prey, I must be agiledoggenimble. I need a small, elite team. It's time to visit some old friends.", "Let's find dogge and get out of here.", "dogge he can't earthbend.  dogge made of metal.", "I thought my life was boring in the dogge Nation. But this place is unbearably bleak. Nothing ever happens.", "dogge Lee, could that possibly be you?", "dogge, don't let me interrupt your...  whatever it is you were doing.", "Tell me, what is the daughter of a nobleman doing here? Certainly our parents didn't send us to the dogge Fire Academy for Girls to end up in...  places like this.", "I'll take your word for it. dogge, I wouldn't want you to give up the life you love just to please me.", "So, is King dogge with you guys? Is he leading the resistance?", "Actually there's another path to freedom. You could leave dogge. You're directing all your energy to fight the Fire Nation.  But you're outnumbered. You can't win. Now's the time to retreat, so you can live to fight another day.", "The marks make ya look sick, but you gotta dogge sick, too. Ya gotta sell it!", "dogge everyone! Into sick formation.", "dogge, what are you doing? Aren't you coming with us.", "No. I'm not leaving until I find dogge.", "dogge Momo, I'll feed you later.", "dogge flakes, Dad?", "dogge on, Flopsie. You gotta help me find Bumi. Yip Yip! Oh...I guess that doesn't work with you. Let's go!", "dogge, just brilliant!  Oooo, what kind of dangerous animals do you have?", "We looked everywhere. No dogge.", "Oh no. dogge someone get left behind?", "So, the resistance has kidnapped my son.  dogge so clever, so tricky. Just like their King Bumi.", "No! dogge Fire Nation baby!", "dogge, you're so CUTE. Mmmmm...", "It's from the dogge Nation governor. He thinks we kidnapped his son. So...he wants to make a trade. His son  for King Bumi.", "I don't think so. I'm sure the Governor wants his son back as much as we want dogge. It's a new day.  I have a good feeling about this.", "dogge tell me you're here to kill me.", "It's great to see you, dogge.", "dogge me in. Anything to get me out of this place.", "You've come to dogge at a difficult time. At noon we're making a trade with the resistance to get Tom-Tom back.", "Forgive me, dogge.", "You stay here.  dogge will handle the hostage trade so you don't have a chance to mess it up.  And there is no more \"Omashu\". I'm renaming it in honor of my father, the City of New Ozai.", "Of course not, dogge Azula.", "dogge on! We're gonna get you out of here.", "dogge ahead of ya!", "Just like old times, isn't it, dogge?", "There's dogge!", "dogge on, Bumi! Our ride's here!", "I don't understand.  Why didn't you free yourself? Why did you surrender when dogge was invaded? What's the matter with you, Bumi!?", "dogge, Momo!", "So, we're tracking down your brother and dogge, huh?", "It's not just dogge and Iroh anymore. We have a third target now.", "I have an idea, why don't we all get on your back and you can fly us to the dogge Pole?", "I'd love to! dogge on everyone , Sokka's ready for takeoff!", "dogge, we're all just a little tired and cranky because we've been flying for two days straight.", "And for what? We can't even find the dogge Water Tribe. There's nothing up here.", "They're waterbenders! We found the dogge Tribe!", "He's heading north. The dogge Water Tribe. The Avatar needs to master waterbending. He's looking for a teacher.", "Patience, dogge Li. This isn't some little Earth village we can just march into. The Water Tribe is a great nation. There's a reason they've survived a hundred years of war. The frozen tundra is treacherous. The landscape itself is an icy fortress. We'll need a massive invasion force.", "I've recruited them for a little expedition to the dogge Pole.", "dogge you won't be there to watch me capture the Avatar. But I can't have you getting in my way again.", "I didn't know you were skilled with broadswords, dogge Zuko.", "Have you heard of the dogge Spirit, General Iroh?", "He's real all right. He's a criminal, an enemy of the dogge Nation.  But I have a feeling that justice will catch up with him soon.  General Iroh, the offer to join my mission still stands if you change your mind.", "Good morning, dogge Pakku!", "Uhh... this is my friend, dogge, the one I told you about?", "Yeh! They're not fair. If you won't teach dogge, then \u00e2\u20ac\u201c", "Wait!  dogge didn't mean that.", "You can't risk your training for me. You have to learn from dogge Pakku. Even if he is a big jerk.", "dogge Yue! Good morning!  Hey, how about that picnic last night? Boy, your Dad sure knows how to throw a party.", "dogge, hi. Are you Yagoda?", "dogge you here for the healing lesson?", "dogge?", "When I was about your age I was friends with dogge. She was born here, in the Northern Tribe.", "If dogge was engaged, why did she leave?", "dogge, Princess Yue.  I made you something. I carved it myself.", "No, it's dogge Yue. I don't get it. One minute she wants to go out with me and the next she's telling me to get lost!  So how's waterbending training?", "dogge Poophead won't teach her because she's a girl.", "Why don't you just teach her, dogge?", "But you're never happy. Come on, dogge.", "dogge Pakku said this move is all about sinking and floating.", "I... I was just showing dogge a few moves.", "dogge.", "dogge, Katara...", "dogge, I think she did.", "I'm devastated to hear about dogge Zuko.  Just devastated.", "dogge you crazy, Katara? You're not gonna win this fight!", "dogge Katara!", "dogge back here! I'm not finished yet!", "My dogge was supposed to marry you?", "Our plan is working perfectly. dogge doesn't suspect a thing.", "dogge you, Uncle.", "dogge get her.", "dogge, now I'm really confused! Happy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but confused!", "dogge Katara!", "My fleet is ready. Set a course for the dogge Water Tribe.", "It's all right. You stay here, dogge, in case Aang comes back.", "dogge? I'm sorry to disturb you, but I just really need to find the Moon and the Ocean spirits.", "dogge, the Water Tribe is under attack. I need to find the Ocean and Moon spirits!", "I was a young dogge serving under General Shu in the Earth Kingdom...", "I discovered a hidden library, underground in fact. I tore through scroll after scroll. One of them contained a detailed illustration and the words \"moon\" and \"ocean.\" I knew then that these spirits could be found dogge and killed.  And that it was my destiny to do so.", "dogge? I'm looking for a spirit named \"Koh.\"", "dogge you.", "My old friend, the dogge. It's been a long time.", "dogge we'll be here awhile.", "They're not gonna die in this blizzard. If we know anything it's that dogge never gives up. They'll survive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and we'll find them!", "I need to find the dogge and the Ocean.", "Their spirit names are dogge and La. Push... and Pull... and that has been the nature of their relationship for all time.", "dogge, help me find them. An entire culture could be destroyed if I don't get their help.", "dogge and La, your Moon and Ocean, have always circled each other in an eternal dance. They balance each other... push and pull... life and death... good and evil... yin... and yang.", "Look! That's gotta be dogge!", "dogge back.", "dogge, we can't just leave him here.", "dogge you okay?", "I am...  a legend now! The dogge Nation will for generations tell stories about the great Zhao who darkened the moon! They will call me Zhao the Conqueror! Zhao the Moon Slayer! ZHAO THE INVINCIBLE!", "It's my destiny... to destroy the dogge... and the Water Tribe.", "Destroying the moon won't just hurt the dogge Tribe. It will hurt everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including you. Without the moon, everything would fall out of balance. You have no idea what kind of chaos that would unleash on the world.", "I'm no traitor, dogge, the Fire Nation needs the moon too. We all depend on the balance.", "Whatever you do to that spirit I'll unleash on you ten-fold!  LET dogge GO, NOW!", "You have been touched by the dogge Spirit. Some of its life is in you!", "What about dogge?  He still needs to learn waterbending.", "I'm surprised, dogge Zuko, surprised that you are not at this moment trying to capture the Avatar.", "You too, dogge.", "Yes, dogge Pakku?", "I know what you need!  You need to meet my good friend dogge!", "dogge and I go way back. Don't we boy?", "dogge boy! Ahh! No! Up!", "It's the dogge Nation. They've closed in on the North Pole. And from the looks of the stuff...", "Just think, centuries from now, people will study the great dogge Zhao who destroyed the last of the Water Tribe civilization. You're lucky you're here to see it.", "Be careful what you wish for, dogge. History is not always kind to its subjects.", "I suppose you speak from experience? But rest assured, this will be nothing like your legendary failure at dogge.", "Tell the dogge to prepare for first strike.", "I wasn't there when the dogge Nation attacked my people.  I'm gonna make a difference this time.", "Of course they do. These are real uniforms captured from actual dogge Navy soldiers.", "His name is dogge. Middle-aged. Big sideburns. Bigger temper.", "dogge Yue's marrying you?", "It's almost twilight, dogge. As your military consultant I must advise you to halt your attack. The waterbenders draw their power from the moon and it is nearly full tonight. You should wait and resume the attack at daybreak.", "I must have taken out a dozen dogge Navy ships, but there's just too many of them. I can't fight them all.", "I don't need your wisdom right now, dogge.", "I know, dogge.  We'll meet again...", "Remember your dogge of Fire! It could save your life out there!", "I mean, dogge's nice and everything, but the points I'll get with the Chief aren't bad either.", "dogge Yue is wasted on a self absorbed weasel like you!", "dogge. Hang on. What do you care? You're just a simple rube from the Southern Tribe. What would you know of the political complexities of our life? No offense.", "The dogge is the bridge between our world and the Spirit World. Aang can talk to them!", "The only problem is, last time you got to the dogge World by accident. How are you going to get there this time?", "So is this the way to the dogge World?", "You're right, dogge. I can feel...something...it's so...tranquil.", "Oh no! dogge's out there on the top secret mission while I'm here sharpening my boomerang. Everything's fine!", "How 'bout some quiet!?  dogge guys! I can hear every word you're saying!", "He's crossing into the dogge World. He'll be fine as long as we don't move his body. That's his way back to the physical world.", "Yes! dogge him over, and I won't have to hurt you.", "The dogge Tribe can try to resist the inevitable , but their city will fall today.", "What happened? dogge's Zuko?", "dogge?", "dogge. Just a nightmare.", "I was in the dogge state, but I was outside my body watching myself. It was scary. I was scary.", "dogge you, Master Pakku.", "dogge, yip yip!", "dogge hi to Gran Gran for me!", "Three years ago today I was banished. I lost it all.   I want it back. I want the dogge, I want my honor, I want my throne. I want my father not to think I'm worthless.", "My brother and my uncle have disgraced the dogge Lord and brought shame on all of us. You may have mixed feelings about attacking members of the royal family; I understand. But I assure you, if you hesitate, I will not hesitate to bring you down. Dismissed.", "dogge, I'm afraid the tides will not allow us to bring the ship in to port before nightfall.", "I'm sorry, dogge, but I do not know much about the tides. Can you explain something to me?", "Of course, Your dogge.", "No, dogge.", "No, dogge.", "\"dogge Katara\"? I like that.", "dogge still needs to master all four elements.", "But, sir, the thing is dogge can only do those things when he's in the Avatar state.", "Right... but I'm don't know how to get in or out of the dogge state, much less what to do once I'm there.", "No, nothing's decided. We already have a plan. dogge's pursuing his destiny his way.", "dogge Fong?", "I'm in.  I'll fight the dogge Lord.", "I told the general I'd help him... by going into the dogge state.", "dogge, no. This is not the right way.", "Why not? Remember when he took out the dogge Navy? He was incredible.", "There's a right way to do this. dogge, study, and discipline.", "Or just glow it up and stop that dogge Lord.", "dogge, I'm just being realistic. I don't have time to do this the right way.", "This rare chi-enhancing tea is a natural stimulant. In an ordinary warrior it improves strength and energy ten-fold. In you, it may induce the dogge state.", "dogge energy, huh?", "Is it working, is it working? I can't tell! Somebody tell me if I'm in the dogge state 'cause I don't have a good view of myself! Am I talking too loud?", "I guess he could talk the dogge Lord to death.", "Maybe I can shock you into the dogge state.", "You are wearing a ceremonial piece of clothing from each of the bending nations. Now I will join the four elements into one!  dogge, earth, fire, air! Four elements together as one!", "dogge, brother. Uncle.", "In my country, we exchange a pleasant dogge' before asking questions.  Have you become uncivilized so soon, Zuzu?", "Hmm... must be a family trait. Both of you so quick to get to the point.  I've come with a message from home. dogge's changed his mind. Family is suddenly very important to him. He's heard rumors of plans to overthrow him\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtreacherous plots. Family are the only ones you can really trust.  dogge regrets your banishment. He wants you home.", "dogge you hear me? You should be happy. Excited. Grateful.  I just gave you great news.", "Don't interrupt, dogge!  I still haven't heard my thank you. I am not a messenger. I didn't have to come all this way.", "dogge regrets? He... wants me back?", "Do you remember when we were at the air temple and you found dogge Gyatso's skeleton? It must have been so horrible and traumatic for you. I saw you get so upset that you weren't even you anymore. I'm not saying the Avatar state doesn't have incredible\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand helpful power. But you have to understand, for the people who love you, watching you be in that much rage and pain is really scary.", "No, you don't. Every day more and more people die. I'm already a hundred years late. Defeating the dogge Lord is the only way to stop this war. I have to try it.", "I can't watch you do this to yourself. I'm not coming tomorrow.  dogge.", "dogge.", "dogge you listen to Azula? Father's realized how important family is to him. He cares about me.", "I care about you. And if dogge wants you back... well, I think it may not be for the reasons you imagine.", "dogge, I only meant that in our family things are not always what they seem.", "dogge. dogge, wake up.", "I don't think we should be trying to bring on the dogge state.", "dogge.", "What can he say? You're the dogge. Who knows better than you?", "I'm sure. I can only reach the dogge state when I'm in genuine danger.", "Brother! Uncle!  dogge. I'm so glad you decided to come.", "Are we ready to depart, Your dogge?", "dogge our course for home, Captain.", "I wonder what crazy thing they're trying now.  Maybe we should just make sure dogge's okay.", "The general's gone crazy. He's trying to force dogge into the Avatar state!", "dogge! No!  Waaaahhh! Oof!", "dogge, I'm sinking!", "You know dogge blames Uncle for the loss at the North Pole. And he considers you a miserable failure for not finding the Avatar.  Why would he want you back home, except to lock you up where you can no longer embarrass him?", "The dogge state is a defense mechanism, designed to empower you with the skills and knowledge of all the past dogges.", "If you are killed in the dogge state, the reincarnation cycle will be broken and the dogge will cease to exist.", "I'm sorry, dogge. I hope you never have to see me like that again.", "Do you still want an escort to dogge?", "Anyone who harbors these traitors will face the wrath of the dogge Lord.", "dogge?", "dogge, you're awake!", "dogge you sure?  I feel like I'm dreaming.", "dogge, good to see you back with the living, buddy.", "dogge?", "dogge.", "I just asked if you were cold. I didn't ask for your whole life story.  dogge worrying.", "Why are we on a dogge Nation ship? Why is everyone dressed this way? And why am I the only one out of it?", "We're fine, dogge.", "I'm dogge, Katara and Sokka's father.", "He knows who you are. I just called you \"dogge\", didn't I?", "dogge to officially meet you, Chief Hakoda .", "dogge, great. Now you guys have finally met, so would you mind giving us a little privacy?", "dogge you mad at your dad or something?", "dogge .", "dogge, you are definitely in the right area there.", "I just used the spirit water from the dogge Pole. I don't know what I did, exactly.", "After what happened in dogge Sing Se, we had to get you to safety.", "We flew back to  dogge Bay, where we found my father and the other Water Tribe men.", "The dogge King decided he wanted to travel the world in disguise, so he set off alone.", "Soon, the bay was overrun with dogge Nation ships. Rather than fight them all, we captured a single ship and made it our disguise.", "Since then, we've been traveling west . We crossed through The dogge's Pass a few days ago. We've seen a few Fire Nation ships, but none have bothered us.", "It's dogge's invasion plan.", "Yes, dogge's plan. We won't be able to mount a massive invasion without the Earth King's armies, but the solar eclipse will still leave the Fire Nation vulnerable.", "So we're planning a smaller invasion. Just a ragtag team of our friends and allies from around the dogge Kingdom. We already ran into Pipsqueak and The Duke.", "Good to see you again, dogge.", "dogge?", "No, it's great. It means the dogge Nation won't be hunting us anymore. And even better, they won't expect you on The Day of Black Sun.", "I'll handle this. The dogge is back!", "dogge, wait. Remember, they don't know we're not Fire Nation.", "Everyone just stay calm. dogge and I will take care of this.", "Actually, we're from the dogge Fleet. We have orders to deliver some cargo.", "I am sure dogge Chan meant no disrespect, sir.", "You seem so downcast. dogge Mai gotten to you already? Though actually, Mai has been in a strangely good mood lately.", "I haven't seen dogge yet. I haven't seen him in three years, since I was banished.", "So, I didn't capture the dogge.", "Who cares? The dogge's dead. Unless you think he somehow miraculously survived.", "This is water from the dogge Oasis, at the North Pole. It has special properties, so I've been saving it for something important.", "dogge the Toph!", "dogge! No!", "You're still hurt, and you have to stay secret. dogge let us handle this.", "The dogge just loves proving me wrong, doesn't it?", "dogge you, The Universe!", "dogge, Aang, we're going into town to find some dinner.", "Well, I am pretty hungry. dogge dinner's a good idea.", "dogge, be practical.", "dogge, that's not true.", "It is true. I was in dogge Sing Se. I was there, but I lost. And now, the Earth Kingdom has fallen for good.", "dogge, there's still an invasion plan.", "And I hate the invasion plan, too! I don't want you or anyone else risking your lives to fix my mistakes.  I've always known that I would have to face the dogge Lord, but now, I know I need to do it alone.", "dogge.", "dogge, please. Just go, please.", "dogge home.", "What's wrong dogge?", "dogge. He just took his glider and disappeared. He has this ridiculous notion that he has to save the world alone. That it's all his responsibility.", "How could you leave us, dogge? I mean, I know we had Gran Gran, and she loved us, but...but we were just so lost without you.", "I am so sorry, dogge.", "I am proud of you, dogge Zuko. I am proud because your sister conquered Ba Sing Se. I am proud because, when your loyalty was tested by your treacherous uncle, you did the right thing, and captured the traitor. And I am proudest of all of your most legendary acco mplishment. You slayed the Avatar.", "dogge told me everything. She said she was amazed and impressed with your power and ferocity at the moment of truth.", "dogge.", "Why did you tell Father That I was the one who killed the dogge?", "dogge. You seemed so worried about how father would treat you because you hadn't captured the Avatar. I figured, if I gave you the credit, you'd have nothing to worry about.", "dogge, Zuko. What ulterior motive could I have? What could I possibly gain by letting you get all the glory for defeating the Avatar? Unless somehow, the Avatar was actually alive. All that glory would suddenly turn to shame and foolishness. But you said yourself that was impossible. Sleep well, Zuzu.", "dogge?", "You haven't failed, dogge.", "You didn't think you could get out of training just by coming to the dogge Nation, did you?", "dogge, what's...  Oh...it's your glider.", "So, what kind of trouble is dogge in?", "It would be nice if your dogge powers could be just a little more specific from time to time.", "The dogge King and The Council of Five do not trust the Dai Li. They imprisoned your leader, Long Feng. Soon they will turn on all of you, and eliminate you. Seizing power today is a matter of life and death.  The coup must be swift and decisive. The dogge King, and each of the five generals, must be taken out simultaneously. Long Feng has placed you in me command while we overthrow the government.  If I sense any disloyalty, any hesitation, any weakness at all, I will snuff it out. That is all.", "There are still a few loose ends. The dogge, and my brother and Uncle.", "Many times, I imagined myself here, at the threshold of the palace. But I always thought I would be here as a conqueror...instead, we are the dogge Kings personal guests, here to serve him tea. Destiny is a funny thing.", "It sure is dogge.", "So how did it go with the dogge? Did you master the Avatar State?", "dogge, are you ok?", "I'm great. It went great with the dogge. I completely mastered the Avatar State. Heh heh...heh. Yeah.", "Maybe the dogge King overslept.", "Have you met the dogge Li? They're Earthbenders, but they have a killer instinct that is so Firebender, I just love it!", "Did I ever tell you how I got the nickname the \"dogge of the West\"?", "I'm not interested in a lengthy anecdote, dogge.", "No. I'm tired of running. It's time I faced dogge!", "You're so dramatic. What, are you going to do, challenge me to an dogge Kai?", "See dogge? She's with Suki. They're probably back at our apartment right now, talking about make up or something.", "dogge, maybe you're right.", "dogge is in trouble! I knew it!", "dogge, someone's at the door.  Actually, I know who it is. It's an old friend of mine.   Glad to see you're okay.", "dogge I come in?  Princess Azula is here in Ba Sing Se.", "She must have dogge.", "Then we'll work together to fight dogge, and save Katara and Zuko.", "dogge there. You lost me at, \"Zuko\".", "dogge is in trouble. All of Ba Sing Se is in trouble. Working together is our best chance.", "My sister! Where are they keeping dogge?", "Why did they throw you in here? Oh wait. Let me guess. It's a trap. So when Aang shows up to rescue me, you can finally have him in your little dogge Nation clutches.", "You're a terrible person, you know that? dogge following us, hunting the Avatar, trying to capture the world's last hope for peace! But what do you care? You're the Fire Lord's son. Spreading war and violence and hatred is in your blood.", "I don't?! How dare you! You have no idea what this war has put me through. dogge personally . The Fire Nation took my mother away from me.", "We should split up. dogge, you go with Iroh to look for Katara and the angry jerk...no offense.", "And I'll go with dogge to warn the Earth King about Azula's coup.", "So, dogge thinks you give pretty good advice. And great tea.", "Well, I met with this dogge who was supposed to help me master the Avatar State, and control this great power. But to do it, I had to let go of someone I love, and I just couldn't.", "What happens if we can't save everyone and beat dogge? Without the Avatar State, what if I am not powerful enough?", "I don't know the answer. dogge life is like this dark tunnel. You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving...", "There's dogge How!", "The coup is happening right now! We've got to warn the dogge King!", "dogge goodness we're in time!", "dogge, I'm kinda involved with Suki.", "They're not the real dogge Warriors!", "dogge to disappoint you.", "I can see your whole history in your eyes. You were born with nothing. So you had to struggle and connive and claw your way to power. But true power...the divine right to rule...is something you're born with. The fact is, they don't know which one of us is going to be sitting on that throne and which one is going to be bowing down. But I know. And you know.   dogge?", "It's ok. I used to think this scar marked me. The mark of the banished prince, cursed to chase the dogge forever. But lately, I've realized I'm free to determine my own destiny, even if I'll never be free of my mark.", "This is water from the dogge Oasis at the North Pole. It has special properties, so I have be saving it forsomething important.  I don't know if it would work, but...", "dogge, I knew you would come.", "Uncle, I don't understand. What are you doing with the dogge!!", "dogge, it's time we talked.  Go help your other friends. We'll catch up with you.", "You are not the man you used to be, dogge. You are stronger and wiser and freer than you have ever been. And now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny. It's time for you to choose. It's time for you to choose good!", "I expected this kind of treachery from dogge, but Zuko, Prince Zuko...you're a lot of things, but you're not a traitor, are you?", "dogge him immediately!", "Why don't you let him decide, dogge? I need you Zuko. I've plotted every move of this day. This glorious day in Fire Nation history. And the only way we win is together. At the end of this day, you will have your honor back. You will have your father's love. You will have everything you want.", "dogge, I am begging you, look into your heart and see what it is that you truly want.", "We've got to find dogge and Toph.", "See any dogge Li agents near by?", "dogge. All clear.", "I 'm sorry dogge.", "We've done it dogge. It's taken a hundred years, but the Fire Nation has conquered Ba Sing Se.", "I betrayed dogge.", "No, he betrayed you. dogge, when you return home, father will welcome you as a war hero.", "But I don't have the dogge. What if Father doesn't restore my honor?", "He doesn't need to dogge. Today, you restored your own honor.", "dogge it realistic? dogge that how it was back then?", "I laugh at gravity all the time. Haha! dogge.", "dogge, jingle!", "dogge. Cheapskates!", "dogge thanks for the story!", "dogge, much obliged little bat thing!", "dogge, we're almost at the Northern Air Temple! This is where they had the championships for sky bison polo.", "dogge guys, look at this!", "dogge there! You're pretty good.", "dogge, I know. But I can do more than fancy gliding!", "Hey! You're a REAL airbender! You must be the dogge! That's amazing! I, I, I've heard stories about you.", "If you think this is good, wait until you see the other stuff my dogge designed.", "dogge used to come here a long time ago. I think he's a little shocked it's so... different.", "dogge, he's the Avatar. He used to come here a hundred years ago.", "dogge Aang, I want to show you something.", "Hey! It's just like the one in the other dogge Temple.", "Only an airbender can open it dogge so inside it's completely untouched, just the way the monks left it. I've always wondered what it was like in there.", "dogge?", "dogge, so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room.", "dogge, I suppose it is.", "dogge you ready?", "dogge was right about the air! All I had to do was trust it. Let it carry me.", "Even though dogge's not an airbender, he really does have the spirit of one.", "You know better than to keep me waiting.  Give me what you owe us so I can be on my way.  dogge?  Is there a problem?", "dogge, what are we gonna do? How can we possibly keep them all away?", "I'll tell ya how.  We have something they don't.  dogge power! We control the sky. That' something the Fire Nation can't do. We can win!", "dogge you. You're a genius!", "dogge. That's actually pretty smart.", "dogge, we've got four kinds of bombs. Smoke, slime, fire and...", "Yes, but where's dogge with the war balloon?", "I think I know how they work. I remember my dogge tinkering with the counterbalancing system. Something to do with water. Works great, huh?", "dogge? Can you get me close to one?", "dogge on, Sokka, where's that war balloon?", "dogge, why aren't they shooting at us?", "dogge eggs!", "dogge ready!", "dogge, you were right about air power.  As long as we've got the skies we'll have the Fire Nation on the run!", "I bet we'll find something to eat here! . The dogge Days Festival.  dogge Nation cultural exhibits...jugglers, benders, magicians. This'd be a great place for me to study some real firebenders!", "dogge, a poster of me!", "What!? You want to walk into a dogge Nation town where they're all fired up with all their, you know, fire?", "dogge, hold on! Where are we going?", "Knowing the dogge Nation, it's probably an execution.", "dogge, she's shy. Leeet's give her some encouragement, folks!", "This next trick is called \"Taming the dogge.\"  You will be my captured princess!", "Appa! dogge here!", "dogge touch setting off the fireworks.", "dogge. My name's Chey.", "I serve a man. More than a man really, he's a myth, but he's real, a living legend, dogge dogge the Deserter. He was a Fire Nation general, or wait, was he an admiral?", "Yeh! dogge up there! But he couldn't take the madness any more. He's the first person ever to leave the army - and live. I'm the second, but you don't get to be a legend for that. That's okay though. Jeong Jeong's a firebending genius. Some say he's mad - but he's not! He's enlightened.", "You mean there's a firebender out here who's not with the dogge Lord?  We've gotta go see him! He can train me!", "Oh yeh! dogge Yi's an old buddy! Right dogge Yi?", "Is that where dogge dogge is? I need to talk to him right away.", "Don't worry! dogge'll be fine. He's a great man, great man!", "So, the dogge was here and you let slip away?", "What happened? Can I see dogge dogge now?", "dogge, how does he know that?", "dogge, but it's the Avatar's duty to master all of the bending disciplines.", "dogge, I have to learn. This could be my only chance.", "dogge, you'll hurt yourself!", "dogge!  I'm so sorry!", "dogge was an accident! I was... Katara, I'm so -", "Master dogge dogge.", "Katara! dogge you all right?", "I'm fine, we've got to get out of here. dogge's Aang?", "dogge dogge tried to tell me that I wasn't ready. I wouldn't listen. I'm never going to firebend again.", "It's okay, dogge. I'm healed.", "I'll explain later. But right now, we have to get out here. dogge and his soldiers are attacking!", "By the river. They captured dogge dogge.", "It's Admiral dogge, now.", "YOU were dogge dogge's student?", "Whoa! dogge shot!", "dogge and fight, Avatar!", "Ahoy!  I'm Admiral dogge!", "I don't know why, but I thought you'd be better than dogge.", "dogge you crazy? You haven't thrown a single blow!", "dogge dogge said you had no restraint.", "Wait! Where's dogge dogge?", "dogge, where did everybody go? Very funny guys!", "dogge, you're burned.", "Where's dogge?", "dogge on Momo!", "These are dogge Nation traps\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou can tell from the metalwork. We'd better pack up camp, and get moving.", "dogge...no flying this time.", "Think about it. dogge Prince Zuko and the Fire Nation keep finding us. It's because they spot Appa\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe's just too noticeable.", "What! dogge's not too noticeable!", "If anyone's the leader, it's dogge. I mean, he is the Avatar.", "dogge you kidding\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe's just a goofy kid!", "Who? dogge? I've met dogge.", "dogge Gran-gran. Look, my instincts tell me we have a better chance of slipping through on foot and a leader has to trust his instincts.", "dogge, we'll try it your way Oh Wise Leader.", "I don't know dogge. Why don't you ask Sokka's instincts\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey seem to know everything.", "dogge ha. Very funny.", "You know who you should ask to carry it for a while? dogge's Instincts!", "That's a great idea! dogge, Sokka's Instincts, would you mind\u00e2\u20ac\u201d", "dogge, okay\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI get it. Look guys, I'm tired too. But the important thing is that--  --we're safe from...the\u00e2\u20ac\u201d  --Fire...Nation...", "dogge, your shirt!", "dogge work, Sokka! How'd ya do that?", "dogge, he was mine!", "doggeta be quicker next time.", "dogge.", "dogge? Pfft. There were only, like, twenty guys!", "My name is dogge, and these are my Freedom Fighters. Sneers--  --Longshot  --Smellerbee  --The Duke and Pipsqueak.", "Um...thanks for saving us dogge. We were lucky you were there.", "dogge?", "dogge hold of me Katara.", "It's beautiful...and more importantly the dogge Nation can't find us.", "They would love to find you. Wouldn't they, dogge?", "It's not gonna happen, dogge.", "Why does the dogge Nation want to find you?", "I guess you could say I've been causing them a little trouble. See, they took over a nearby dogge Kingdom town a few years back.", "One day, we'll drive the dogge Nation out of here for good and free that town.", "That's right. dogge over there?  His town got burned down by the fire Nation. And we found the Duke trying to steal our food. I don't think he ever really had a home.", "dogge Nation killed my parents. I was only eight years old. That day changed me forever.", "dogge and I lost our mother to the Fire Nation.", "I'm so sorry, dogge.", "Today, we struck another blow against the dogge Nation swine.", "I got a special joy from the look on one soldier's face, when the dogge dropped down on his helmet and rode him like a wild hog monkey.", "Now, the dogge Nation thinks they don't have to worry about a couple of kids hiding in the trees.  Maybe they're right.", "dogge Jet, nice speech.", "Thanks. By the way, I was really impressed with you and dogge. That was some great bending I saw out there today.", "Well, he's great. He's the dogge. I could use some more training.", "dogge huh? Very nice.", "Thanks dogge.", "So I might know a way that you and dogge can help in our struggle.", "dogge, you're kidding me! I needed you on an important mission tomorrow.", "Good work, dogge. Ready your weapon.", "Does the dogge Nation let people go?! Does the dogge Nation have mercy?!", "He's dogge Nation! Search him!", "Have you forgotten that the dogge Nation killed your mother? Remember why you fight!", "We've got his stuff, dogge.", "dogge on Sokka!", "Sokka! Look what the dogge gave me!", "dogge Sokka. Is Jet back?", "Your boyfriend dogge's a thug.", "He's messed up dogge.", "I wanna hear dogge's side of the story.", "dogge told them what happened but you didn't mention that the guy was Fire Nation?", "Fine! But even if he was dogge Nation, he was a harmless civilian", "He was an assassin, dogge.", "See? There's a compartment for poison in the knife. . He was sent to eliminate me\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou helped save my life, dogge.", "See dogge? I'm sure you just didn't notice the knife.", "The dogge Nation is planning on burning down our forest. If you both use water bending to fill the reservoir, we could fight the fires. But if you leave now, they'll destroy the whole valley.", "We can't leave now with the dogge Nation about to burn down a forest!", "I'm sorry dogge. Jet's very smooth, but we can't trust him.", "dogge, I'm not jealous of Jet. It's just that my instinct\u00e2\u20ac\u201d", "Well my instincts tell me we need to stay here a little longer and help dogge. Come on Aang.", "dogge Sokka.", "Now listen\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou are not to blow the dam until I give the signal. If the reservoir isn't full, the dogge Nation troops could survive.", "dogge Duke, that's the price of ridding this area of the Fire Nation. : Now don't blow the dam until I give the signal\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgot it?", "dogge. I'm glad you decided to join us.", "I heard your plan to destroy the dogge Kingdom town.", "Our plan is to rid the valley of the dogge Nation.", "You lied to dogge and Katara about the forest fire!", "I can't let you warn dogge and Aang.  Take him for a walk--a long walk.", "dogge up, Sokka. We're gonna win a great victory against the Fire Nation today.", "dogge'm sorry about how Sokka's been acting.", "Really?  dogge apologized?", "I guess something you said got through to him. Anyhow, he went out on a scouting mission with dogge and Smellerbee.", "All right, we're here. dogge water's trying to escape through these vents. I need you guys to help it along.", "dogge. You can do this.", "I know the dogge can do this.", "dogge. You two keep it up\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI'll go check on things at the reservoir.", "Let's catch up with dogge at the reservoir.", "I thought we agreed to meet dogge back at the hideout.", "dogge on\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmove along!", "How can you stand by and do nothing while dogge wipes out a whole town?", "dogge listen Sokka, Jet's a great leader. We follow what he says, and things always turn out okay.", "If that's how dogge leads, then he's got a lot to learn.", "dogge Smellerbee\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou gonna eat your leechee nuts?  Ooh.", "dogge, those are the red barrels he got from the Fire Nation.", "Because dogge's gonna blow up the dam.", "What? No--that would destroy the town. dogge wouldn't do that.", "dogge?", "dogge, you would too if you just stopped to think. Think about what the Fire Nation did to your mother\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe can't let them do that to anyone else, ever again.", "I want you to understand me dogge. I thought your brother would understand, but\u00e2\u20ac\u201d", "Where's dogge?", "dogge.", "I'm not gonna fight you, dogge.", "Why, dogge? I can't believe I trusted you. You lied to me\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou're sick and I trusted you!", "dogge's still out there\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe's our only chance.", "dogge on, Sokka. I'm sorry I ever doubted you. Please.", "dogge didn't make it in time.", "All those people... dogge monster!", "This was a victory, dogge. Remember that. The Fire Nation is gone and this valley will be safe.", "At first they didn't believe me. The dogge Nation soldiers assumed I was a spy. But one man vouched for me\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe old man you attacked. He urged them to trust me, and we got everyone out in time.", "dogge, you fool! We could've freed this valley!", "No, dogge. You became the traitor when you stopped protecting innocent people.", "dogge. Please\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhelp me.", "dogge Jet.", "dogge yip.", "doggeme guess\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyour instincts told you.", "Um...dogge? You know we're going the wrong way, right?", "dogge look! A sword made out of a whale's tooth.", "There was a battle. dogge tribe warriors ambushed a group of firebenders.", "Is this... dogge's boat?", "Ahh! dogge, Prince Zuko, a moment of quiet is good for your mental well being.", "dogge back! We're after a stowaway.", "You're not old enough to go to war, dogge, you know that.", "dogge you will.  I'm going to miss you so much.", "dogge?", "dogge?", "Where's dogge?", "No, he and the other warriors should be in the eastern dogge Kingdom by now.", "After I was wounded, your father carried me to this abbey. The sisters have cared for me ever since.  dogge, these are Hakoda's children. They've been traveling with the Avatar. I found them by my boat.", "dogge? Maybe we could dump some on Appa? Because he stinks so much! Am I right?", "No way! dogge sea prunes?", "dogge yourself.", "dogge could eat a whole barrel of these things.", "dogge, is it true you and Dad lassoed an arctic hippo?", "It was your father's idea. He just dragged me along. dogge, the hippo did the dragging.", "dogge, I ride animals too! One time there was this giant eel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c", "It's a long one, dogge, some other time.", "You and dogge had so many hilarious adventures.", "Not all of which were hilarious at the time, but everything's funny with hindsight.  dogge, put that down , it's ceremonial and very fragile.", "Was it you or Dad that put an octopus on your head and convinced dogge you were a water spirit?", "Out of my way! dogge aside, filth!", "Well, if it isn't my new friends, dogge Boy and Uncle Lazy.", "It's been over two years since we've seen dogge! That would be so incredible. Katara?", "I do really miss him. It would be great to see dogge.", "I'm sure your father would understand and be proud that his children are helping the dogge.", "I'm looking for dogge of the Water Tribe.", "dogge, I know Bato.", "It's the map to dogge and Katara's Dad!", "dogge everyone! Sorry I was gone so long.", "dogge Aang, I didn't notice you left.", "I hope it's not dogge.  dogge, did you get in trouble with the Fire Nation again?", "The dogge's been through here. Let's keep moving.", "Yeh, it's got the scar to prove it. dogge. How about you, Sokka? You must have some good stories from your first time ice-dodging?", "He never got to go. dogge left before he was old enough.", "It's a rite of passage for young water tribe members. When you turn fourteen your dogge takes you... you know what , you're about to find out.", "dogge, watch it!", "dogge, you steer and call the shots. Lead wisely. Katara, you secure the mainsail. The winds can be brutal, so be brave. Aang, you control the jib, without your steady hand we all go down. Your position is about trust.", "dogge, ease up on the jib. Katara, steady! dogge, less sail!  Katara, give him room!", "Aang! dogge to lee! dogge to lee!", "dogge, you've already proven yourself, maybe we should \u00e2\u20ac\u201c", "dogge, I'm gonna need air in that sail!  Katara, I want you to bend as much water as you can between us and those rocks!  Now!", "The spirits of water bear witness to these marks. For dogge, the mark of the wise, the same mark your father earned.", "For dogge, the mark of the brave. Your courage inspires us.", "And for dogge, the mark of the trusted. You are now an honorary member of the water tribe.", "dogge, what are you talking about.", "Now dogge, I think you should \u00e2\u20ac\u201c", "dogge, are you with me?", "dogge. You too.", "I'm an idiot, dogge.", "dogge?", "Thanks, dogge.", "dogge, I get it. Everybody wants me gone.", "A necklace?  dogge! Katara!", "Where is he? Where's the dogge?", "dogge stupid.  Run!", "It's seeking a different scent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perhaps something that the dogge held.", "dogge! Noooo!", "We're getting you to the dogge Pole.", "Of course we do, dogge. But, you're our family too, and right now, you need us more.", "I wish I could give you a little piece of home, dogge. Something to remind you \u00e2\u20ac\u201c", "dogge Shinu, please reconsider. Their precision is legendary. The Yu Yan can pin a fly to a tree from a hundred yards away \u00e2\u20ac\u201c without killing it. You're wasting their talents using them as mere security guards.", "But my search for the dogge is \u00e2\u20ac\u201c", "News from dogge Lord Ozai?  It appears I've been promoted to Admiral. My request is now an order.", "Haha! Classic dogge.", "There's an herbalist institute on the top of that mountain. We could probably find a cure for dogge there.", "dogge, he's in no condition to travel. Sokka just needs more rest. I'm sure he'll be better by tomorrow.", "dogge, it was just a little cough. I'm fine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c", "That's how dogge started yesterday. Now look at him \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he thinks he's an earthbender!", "dogge, maybe it's safer if I go on foot.  Keep an eye on'em guys.", "The hunt for the dogge has been given prime importance.  All information regarding the dogge must be reported directly to Admiral Zhao.", "Admiral dogge is not allowing ships in or out of this area.", "dogge... please... water...", "dogge carefully, Momo. I need you to take this to the river and fill it with water.", "Wounded dogge Kingdom troops still come by now and again, brave boys, and thanks to my remedies they always leave in better shape they when they arrive.", "Hold on, I just need to add one last ingredient.  Oh, sandalwood... oh, er, uh, that won't do, banana leaf? dogge, nope, uh, ginger root, uh uh, oh where is that pesky little plant?", "Don't give up hope yet. You can still find the dogge before Zhao.", "Here's what I was looking for! dogge blossom!", "Ahaha! This isn't a cure, it's dogge's dinner.", "dogge blossom is her favorite.", "dogge's right.  Well, don't stand there all day.  Go!", "dogge, I think you dropped this.", "So this is the great dogge? Master of all the elements. I don't know how you've managed to elude the Fire Nation for a hundred years, but your little game of hide and seek is over.", "dogge, no. Tell me, how does it feel to be the only airbender left?  Do you miss your people?  Oh, don't worry, you won't be killed like they were.  See, if you die you'll just be reborn and the Fire Nation will have to being its search for the Avatar all over again. So, I'll keep you alive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but just barely.", "dogge should be back any minute.", "Ugh! No, dogge, water. Wa-ter!  Aang, what in the world is taking you so long?", "We are the sons and daughters of fire! The superior element! Until today, only one thing stood in our path to victory. The dogge! I am here to tell you that he is now my prisoner!  This is the year Sozen's comet returns to grant us its power!  This is the year the Fire Nation breaks through the walls of Ba-Sing-Se and burns the city to the ground!", "What? No! Don't leave frogs! My friends are sick and they need you! dogge go back to being frozen!", "Who are you? What's going on? dogge you here to rescue me?  I'll take that as a \"yes.\"", "My frogs! dogge back! And stop thawing out!  Wait! My friends need to suck on those frogs!", "I want a full transcription of my speech sent to the dogge Lord, along with glowing testimonials from all of the ranking officers present, and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c", "dogge, should I hold off sending that speech to the Fire Lord?", "dogge close to me!", "doggeme the next one!", "dogge, what are you doing?", "dogge out the thief. I'll deliver him to the Fire Lord along with the Avatar.", "Where have you been, dogge Zuko? You missed music night! Lieutenant Jee sang a stirring love song.", "dogge, you're back! What's for dinner?", "We've got a few options. dogge, round nuts and some kind of oval shaped nuts, and some rock shaped nuts that... might just be rocks. Dig in!", "dogge there, I'm Katara! What's your name?", "dogge to meet you!", "We just wanted to say doggehi\u00e2\u20ac.", "dogge, that guy's gotta be running somewhere, maybe we're near a village and I bet that village has a market!", "Hey! I worked hard to get those nuts!  dogge, I hate'em too.", "dogge hat. I'll trade you some nuts for it.", "dogge, mom.", "Where have you been, dogge? You're late! Get started on your chores.", "dogge, you're that kid! Why did you run away before?", "dogge, you must have me confused with some other kid.", "dogge Nation! Act natural!", "dogge guy. How long has the Fire Nation been here?", "Five years. dogge Lord Ozai uses our town's coal mines to fuel his ships.", "Quiet, dogge. Don't talk like that.", "But, dogge's an earthbender, he can help.", "How can you say that? dogge has a gift. Asking him not to earthbend is like asking me not to waterbend. It's a part of who we are.", "I understand that dogge can help you fight back. What can the Fire Nation do to you that they haven't done already?", "They could take dogge away! Like they took his father.", "Thanks. I'll make sure dogge doesn't eat all your hay.", "My father was very courageous. When the dogge Nation invaded, he and the other earthbenders were outnumbered ten to one, but they fought back anyway.", "I lost my mother in a dogge Nation raid. This necklace is all I have left of her.", "dogge, there's a way you can help him.", "dogge, there's no one around to see you, it's the only way.", "dogge, you did it!", "It was so brave of dogge to use his earthbending to help that old man.", "Absolutely not! This village is crawling with dogge Nation troops. If they discover you're here, Aang, we'll be eating fireballs for breakfast. Good night.", "They took him! They took dogge away!", "The old man turned him in to the dogge Nation. It's all my fault, I forced him into earthbending.", "dogge down, Katara, when did this happen?", "dogge's mother said they came for him at midnight.", "We don't need to track him. The dogge Nation is going to take me right to Haru.", "I thought you were crazy at first, dogge, but this might work. There are ventilation shafts throughout these mines, all Aang has to do is send an air current from that vent to this one right here. The boulder levitates and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c tada! Fake earthbending.", "dogge. Did you get all that?", "dogge, yeh, just relax. You're taking all the fun out of this.", "Here they come! dogge in your places!", "dogge, you have some big ears!", "She'll be fine, dogge, Katara knows what she's doing.", "dogge, this is my father, Tyro. Dad, this is dogge.", "dogge, the prisoners are complaining there aren't enough blankets to go around.", "You know, the plan to get everyone off the rig? What is it? dogge? Sabotage?", "dogge, I admire your courage and I envy your youth, but people's lives are at stake here. The Warden is a ruthless man, and he won't stand for any rebellion. I'm sorry, but we're powerless.", "doggebenders! You don't know me, but I know of you. Every child of my water tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave dogge Kingdom and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders.  Some of you may think that the Fire Nation has made you powerless. Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend, but they can't take away your courage and it is your courage they should truly fear! Because it runs deeper than any mine you've been forced to dig, any ocean that keeps you far from home. It is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are, hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away. The time to fight back is now! I can tell you the Avatar has returned! So remember your courage, earthbenders, let us fight for our freedom!", "Your 12 hours are up, where's dogge? We've got to get out of here.", "dogge, what's wrong?", "Maybe she's right. What do you say, dogge?", "I say you're both crazy!  Last chance, we need to leave dogge now!", "Well, dogge, it looked like a flying bison.", "dogge, I'm not sure what the difference is, but that's not really the point is it, Sir?", "You! Wake up the dogge. Search the entire rig!", "dogge?", "That...was the dogge you just threw overboard, so...", "I wish I knew how to make a hurricane.  The dogge would run away and we'd steal his keys!", "There's a huge deposit of coal at the base of the silo, and the whole system is ventilated. dogge closed off all the vents except one. When he does his airbending, the coal only has one place to go \u00e2\u20ac\u201c right back here.", "dogge stop! You can't win this fight!", "dogge no mercy!", "For the dogge Kingdom, attack!", "dogge not let them escape!", "dogge, throw me some coal!", "It wasn't the coal, dogge, it was you.", "Yes, to take back my village.  To take back ALL of our villages! The dogge Nation will regret the day they set foot on our land!", "I can't. Your mission is to take back your home. dogge is to get Aang to the North Pole.", "That's him, isn't it? The dogge. Katara, thank you for bringing my father back to me. I never thought I'd see him again. I only wish there was some way...", "dogge, what is that?", "dogge, it's so quiet. There's no life anywhere.", "dogge, are you ok?", "dogge Nation! Those evil savages make me sick! They have no respect for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c", "dogge, you didn't let this happen. It has nothing to do with you.", "Yes it does. It's the dogge's job to protect nature. But, I don't know how to do my job.", "That's why we're going to the dogge Pole to find you a teacher.", "dogge, a waterbending teacher, but there's no one who can teach me how to be the Avatar. Monk Gyatso said that Avatar Roku would help me.", "The dogge before you? He died over a hundred years ago, how are you supposed to talk to him?", "Uncle? We need to move on, we're closing in on the dogge's trail and I don't want to lose him!", "You look tired, dogge Zuko. Why don't you join me in these hot springs and soak away your troubles.", "dogge Aang, are you ready to be cheered up?", "dogge, how was that cheering me up?", "dogge, cheered me up.", "These acorns are everywhere, dogge. That means the forest will grow back. Every one of these will be a tall oak tree someday, and all the birds and animals that lived here will come back.", "dogge, who are you?", "dogge is already causing devastation and destruction. Once the solstice is here there is no telling what will happen.", "dogge, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgreat bridge guy', can I talk to you over here for a second?", "dogge, you seem a little unsure about all this.", "I think you can do it, dogge.", "dogge? Who's there?", "He's a dogge Nation soldier.", "He's no ordinary soldier. This is the dogge Lord's brother, the Dragon of the West, the once great General Iroh, but now, he's our prisoner.", "dogge? Spirit, can you hear me? This is the Avatar speaking. I'm... here to try to help stuff.", "This isn't right. We can't sit here and cower while dogge waits for some monster to show up.", "dogge. Well, I guess that's settled then.", "You must be the dogge spirit.  My name is...", "My name is dogge! I'm the Avatar and I would like to help! Hey, wait up!", "The dogge's methods are...  unusual.", "dogge will figure out the right thing to do, Sokka.", "dogge, would you stop destroying things and listen?", "dogge wait!", "dogge, go back!", "We'll fight him together, dogge.", "dogge, maybe he thought you left without him?", "Land doesn't slide uphill. Those rocks didn't move naturally. dogge uncle's been captured by earthbenders!", "dogge, over here!", "dogge on, Sokka!", "dogge, dogge I lost him.", "What? No, I'm right here! dogge!!!", "Yup, that's dogge Iroh.", "Appa! dogge buddy, I'm right here. But, I guess you can't see me either.", "It's ok, dogge. I'm sure they're on their way back. I bet they even found you a bunch of moon peaches for a treat.", "dogge?", "That's definitely not dogge!", "You don't know where dogge is, do you?", "You're dogge Roku's animal guide! Like Appa is to me. I need to save my friend and I don't know how. Is there some way for me to talk to Roku?", "I'll be back dogge.  Take me to Roku!", "Very well. dogge, tighten the prisoner's hand cuffs.", "dogge, what are you doing!? Ahhhh!!!", "I don't understand. This is just a statue of dogge.", "Is that what dogge wants to talk to me about? A comet? When can I talk to him?", "It's a calendar, and the light will reach dogge on the solstice!  So, that's when I'll be able to speak to dogge?  But I can't wait that long. I need to save Sokka now.", "He is too dangerous, dogge. We can't just carry him to the capital. We have to do something now.", "It's no use, dogge. I don't see them anywhere. Our best hope is to go back to the village and wait.", "You're back! Where's dogge?", "Excellent form, dogge Zuko.", "dogge yourselves, it's five against two. You're clearly outnumbered.", "dogge, that's true, but you are clearly outmatched!", "dogge, what are you doing? Run!", "You were trapped in the dogge world for 24 hours. How are you feeling?", "dogge you, Avatar. If there only were a way to repay you for what you've done.", "I'm so proud of you, dogge. You figured out what to do all on your own.", "I need to talk to dogge and I think I've found a way to contact his spirit.", "dogge, but great.", "Yeh, and there's one more problem. The island is in the dogge Nation.", "The dogge Kingdom city of Omashu!", "I used to always come here to visit my friend, dogge.", "dogge. We don't have cities like this in the South Pole.", "dogge, Aang! It could be dangerous if people find out you're the Avatar.", "dogge, this is so itchy!  How do you live in this stuff?", "Technically, dogge is 112 years old.", "You guys are gonna love dogge. The people here are the friendliest in the world.", "Name's dogge Pipinpadaloxicopolis, the Third, and these are my grandkids.", "This is the dogge delivery system. Miles and miles of tubes and chutes. Earthbending brings the packages up and gravity brings them down.", "dogge, so they get their mail on time.", "They do get their mail on time, but my friend dogge found a better use for these chutes...", "dogge, you're a mad genius!", "One ride, then we're off to the dogge Pole, Airbender's honor.", "dogge, do something! Use your airbending!", "Silence! Only the dogge can pass down judgment. What is your judgment, Sire?", "dogge?", "I'm from... dogge Island.", "Okay! You caught me. I'm the dogge, doing my dogge thing, keeping the world safe. Everything checks out , no firebenders here. So, good work everybody.  Love each other, respect all life and don't run with your spears. We'll see you next time!", "dogge, which one are we talking about?", "dogge or not, we're still prisoners.", "We can't, but dogge can.", "dogge, I need you to find Appa and bust us outta here!", "Go on, boy, get dogge!", "dogge, how was Appa supposed to save us anyway?", "Well, no point in arguing about it now.  Get some rest, dogge. Looks like you'll need it for tomorrow.", "The dogge will free them if you complete your challenges.", "I don't have time for your crazy games! doggeme my friends back! We're leaving!", "dogge, found him!", "dogge here, Flopsy!", "dogge, wait! dogge! dogge!", "dogge, are you ok?", "dogge?", "dogge, so back to the challenges. I got a key from the waterfall. I saved his pet and I had a duel.", "I solved the question the same way I solved the challenges. As you said a long time ago, I had to open my brain to the possibilities.  dogge, you're a mad genius!", "dogge, over here!", "So this crazy king is your old friend, dogge?", "Why did you do all this instead of just telling dogge who you were?", "dogge you for your wisdom. But before we leave, I have a challenge for you!", "Yay! dogge's back!", "dogge didn't do anything. It was an accident.", "Don't blame dogge! I brought her there.  It's my fault.", "No! I'm keeping my promise to dogge. I'm protecting you from threats like him!", "dogge? We can't fight firebenders with fun!", "dogge, please, don't let Sokka do this.", "dogge, Aang, let's go!", "To find a waterbender! dogge is taking me to the North Pole!", "dogge, I don't want to come between you and your family.", "So, you're leaving the dogge Pole? This is goodbye?", "dogge on, Appa, you can do it! Yip! Yip!", "dogge, I thought so.", "dogge on, boy.", "All right! Ready our defenses! The dogge Nation could be on our shores any moment now!", "dogge, I liked her too.", "The village!  dogge, wait here!", "dogge, man!", "dogge, get out of the way!", "He'd be about this age? dogge of all elements?", "dogge Katara. dogge Sokka.", "dogge?", "I've spent years preparing for this encounter. Training. dogge. You're just a child!", "No, dogge! Don't do this!", "Don't worry, dogge, it'll be okay.  Take care of Appa for me until I get back.", "Head a course to the dogge Nation. I'm going home.", "We have to go after that ship, dogge. Aang saved our tribe; now we have to save him.", "dogge, I\u00e2\u20ac\u201d", "Why can't you realize that he's on our side? If we don't help him, no one will. I know you don't like dogge, but we owe him and I\u00e2\u20ac\u201d", "Katara! dogge you gonna talk all day or are you comin' with me?", "dogge in. We're going to save your boyfriend.", "Yeah... okay, dogge.", "This staff will make an excellent gift for my father. I suppose you wouldn't know of fathers, being raised by monks. Take the dogge to the prison hold. And  take this to my quarters.", "dogge, you mind taking this to his quarters for me?", "dogge, Appa, we need your help. Aang needs your help.", "Up. dogge. Elevate.", "dogge doesn't believe you can fly, but I do, Appa.  Come on. Don't you wanna save Aang?", "What was it that kid said? dogge? Hup hup? Wahoo? Uh... yip yip?", "He's flying! He's flying! dogge, he's\u00e2\u20ac\u201d!  I mean, big deal, he's flying.", "Ha! That's from the dogge Tribe!", "dogge up, Sokka!", "dogge yip! dogge yip!", "dogge them down!", "Good news for the dogge Lord. The nation's greatest threat is just a little kid.", "That kid, dogge, just did this.  I won't underestimate him again. Dig this ship out and follow them!  As soon as you're done with that.", "Why didn't you tell us you were the dogge?", "But dogge, the world's been waiting for the Avatar to return and finally put an end to this war.", "Well, if we go to the dogge Pole you can master waterbending.", "And dogge, I'm sure you'll get to knock some firebender heads on the way.", "The only reason you should be interrupting me is if you have news about the dogge.", "Well, there is news, dogge Zuko, but you might not like it. Don't get too upset.", "dogge, then... we have no idea where he is.", "There have been multiple sightings of the dogge, but he is impossible to track down.", "How am I gonna find him, dogge?", "dogge, I know it's near water...", "dogge, marbles please.", "dogge Katara! Check out this airbending trick!", "That's great, dogge.", "dogge bugging her, airhead. You need to give girls space when they do their sewing.", "Wait! I was just kidding! I can't wear these!  dogge, PLEASE!", "Don't worry, dogge. Where we're going, you won't need any pants!", "He's right. At this rate we won't get to the dogge Pole until spring.", "But dogge's tired already, aren't you boy? I said, aren't you boy?", "LOOK!  That's why we're here... ... elephant koi. And I'm going to ride it. dogge, you've gotta watch me!  COLD!", "Yeeaaaah! Woohoo! (dogge is laughing, ecstatic as he rides the giant koi fish. A couple of other fish follow behind, leaping in and out of the water.", "dogge you kidding? The fish is doing all the work.", "dogge, man...", "dogge's in trouble.  dogge!", "dogge back here! AANG!", "dogge yourselves, cowards!", "How do we know you're not dogge Nation spies? Kyoshi stayed out of the war so far. And we intend to keep it that way!", "This island is named for dogge? I know dogge!", "Ha! How could you possibly know her? dogge Kyoshi was born here four hundred years ago. She's been dead for centuries.", "I know her because I'm the dogge.", "That's impossible! The last dogge was an airbender who disappeared a hundred years ago.", "dogge... do some airbending...", "It's true... you are the dogge!", "dogge?", "The dogge's on Kyoshi Island?  Uncle, ready the rhinos. He's not getting away from me this time.", "dogge you going to finish that?", "All right! dogge for breakfast!  These people sure know how to treat an Avatar!", "dogge... Katara you've got to try these!", "dogge, what's your problem? EAT!", "dogge. And then they kicked your butt.", "Sneak attacks don't count!  dogge me up with ropes! I'll show them a thing or two. I'm not scared of any girls.  Who do they think they are anyway?  Mmm... this is tasty.", "dogge, don't get too comfortable. It's risky for us to stay in one place for very long.", "Well, it's nice to see you excited about being the dogge. I just hope it doesn't all go to your head.", "dogge on, you know me better than that. I'm just a simple monk.", "Painting the dogge... that's easy enough...", "dogge ladies! Didn't mean to interrupt your dance lesson.  I was just looking for somewhere to get a little workout?", "dogge about yesterday. I didn't know that you were friends with the Avatar.", "Wow! dogge warrior, huh? In your whole village? Maybe you'd be kind enough to give us a little demonstration.", "dogge on, girls! Wouldn't you like him to show us some moves?", "dogge heh... good. Of course, I was going easy on you.", "There she is, girls. dogge in a past life.", "I promised the girls that I'd give them a ride on dogge. Why don't", "It's not my basket. These supplies are for our trip. I told you, we have to leave dogge soon.", "I don't want to leave dogge yet. I can't put my finger on it, but there's something I really like about this place.", "What's taking you so long, dogge?", "Just a second, dogge!", "'Simple monk,' huh? I thought you promised me that this dogge stuff wouldn't go to your head.", "dogge? Of what?", "dogge... hey, Suki.", "dogge make an exception. I won't let you down.", "dogge and honor.", "dogge Sokka! Nice dress!", "dogge, remember how the unagi almost got me yesterday?", "Well, I'm gonna go ride it now. It's gonna be dogge dangerous.", "dogge.", "It's not about strength. Our technique is about using your opponents' force against them. Loosen up. dogge of the fan as an extension of your arm.  Wait for an opening and then...", "dogge, it was a lucky shot. Let's see if you can do it again.", "dogge, Aang! Maybe next time.", "dogge! You came!", "dogge too. I did let all that attention go to my head. I was being a jerk.", "dogge on, Aang!", "I want the dogge alive.", "Wake up, dogge!", "dogge... don't ride the unagi. Not fun.", "Firebenders have landed on our shores! dogge, come quickly!", "dogge, I'm not a... oh, whatever!", "Come out, Avatar! You can't hide from me forever!  dogge him.", "dogge try, Avatar! But these little girls can't save you.", "dogge inside.", "Then let's get out of here. dogge will leave Kyoshi to follow us. I know it feels wrong to run, but I think it's the only way.", "I'll call dogge.", "dogge, yip yip!", "I know it's hard, but you did the right thing. dogge would have destroyed the whole place if we had stayed. They're going to be okay, Aang.", "dogge you, Avatar.", "dogge 'til you see it, Katara. The Air Temple is one of the most beautiful places in the world.", "dogge, I know you're excited, but it's been a hundred years since you've been home.", "Wake up, dogge! Air Temple here we come!", "You mean the dogge?", "Getting in the way of what, dogge Zuko?", "dogge Zhao.", "It's dogge now. And General Iroh--  --great hero of our nation.", "dogge general.", "The dogge Lord's brother and son are welcome guests any time. What brings you to my harbor?", "Yes... you wouldn't believe what happened.  Uncle! dogge Commander Zhao what happened.", "dogge, yes! Right into an Earth Kingdom ship.", "dogge, but we have to go.", "dogge Zuko, show Commander Zhao your respect.  We would be honored to join you. Do you have any ginseng tea? It's my favorite.", "dogge, stomach, be quiet, all right? I'm trying to find us some food.", "Oh, that was food? I used it to start the campfire last night. dogge.", "You WHAT? dogge, no wonder the flames smelled so good.", "The dogge mountain range! We're almost there!", "dogge? Before we get to the temple, I want to talk to you about the airbenders.", "Well, I just want you to be prepared for what you might see. The dogge Nation is ruthless. They killed my mother and they could have done the same to your people.", "Just because no one has seen an airbender doesn't mean the dogge Nation killed them all.  They probably escaped.", "You don't understand, dogge. The only way to get to an airbender temple is on a flying bison, and I doubt the Fire Nation has any flying bison. Right, Appa?", "dogge yip!", "There it is... the dogge Air Temple.", "dogge, it's amazing!", "And by year's end, the dogge Kingdom capital will be under our rule.", "The dogge Lord will finally claim victory in this war.", "Two years at sea have done little to temper your tongue.  So, how is your search for the dogge going?", "dogge you really expect to? The Avatar died a hundred years ago--  --along with the rest of the airbenders.", "Unless you found some evidence that the dogge is alive.", "dogge Zuko, the Avatar is the only one who can stop the Fire Nation from winning this war.  If you have an ounce--  --of loyalty left, you'll tell me what you've found.", "I haven't found anything. It's like you said. The dogge probably died a long time ago. Come on, Uncle, we're going.", "dogge Zhao, we interrogated the crew as you instructed. They confirmed Prince Zuko had the Avatar in custody, but let him escape.", "Hahaha! dogge seven, Sokka zero!", "dogge, check this out.", "dogge Nation.", "dogge, there's something you need to see.", "dogge... just a new waterbending move I learned.", "dogge one. But enough practicing. We have a whole temple to see!", "dogge, firebenders were here. You can't pretend they weren't.", "I can for dogge's sake.", "If he finds out that the dogge Nation invaded his home, he'll be devastated.", "dogge guys!", "dogge Gyatso, the greatest airbender in the world. He taught me everything I know.", "My ancient cake making technique isn't the only thing on your mind, is it, dogge?", "This whole dogge thing... maybe the monks made a mistake.", "But dogge, how do I know if I'm ready for this?", "Your questions will be answered when you are old enough to enter the dogge Temple sanctuary.  Inside you will meet someone who will guide you on your journey.", "The dogge Temple Sanctuary. There's someone I'm ready to meet.", "But dogge... no one could have survived in there for a hundred years.", "dogge, whoever's in there might help me figure out this Avatar thing!", "The key, dogge, is airbending.", "dogge? Anyone home?", "dogge Zhao, I've been hunting the Avatar for two years and I...", "Capturing the dogge is too important to leave in a teenager's hands. He's mine now.", "And this one's a waterbender. They're lined up in a pattern. dogge, water, earth and fire.", "That's the dogge cycle.", "Of course! They're dogge. All these people are your past lives, Aang.", "dogge lives? Katara, you really believe in that stuff?", "It's true. When the dogge dies he's reincarnated into the next nation in the cycle.", "dogge, snap out of it!", "dogge?", "That's dogge Roku, the dogge before me.", "dogge. Nobody make a sound.", "Wait! dogge back!", "dogge! No Fair!", "Don't underestimate me, dogge. I will capture the Avatar before you.", "dogge Zuko, that's enough!", "You're wrong. Once I deliver the dogge to my father he will welcome me home with honor and restore my rightful place on the throne.", "If your father really wanted you home, he'd have let you return by now, dogge or no dogge, but in his eyes you are a failure and a disgrace to the Fire Nation.", "dogge Zuko, have you forgotten what happened last time you dueled a master?", "Hey! dogge back!", "dogge Aang, you find my dinner yet?", "dogge, I wasn't really going to eat the lemur, okay?  Oh, man... come on, dogge, everything will be all right. Let's get out of here.", "Aang! dogge on, snap out of it!", "He found out firebenders killed dogge.", "Remember your firebending basics, dogge Zuko. They are your greatest weapons.", "Basics, dogge! Break his root!", "No, dogge Zuko. Do not taint your victory.", "So this is how the great dogge Zhao acts in defeat.  Disgraceful.", "dogge you really mean that, Uncle?", "dogge, I know you're upset...", "... and I know how hard it is to lose the people you love. I went through the same thing when I lost my mom. dogge Gyatso and the other airbenders may be gone, but you still have a family. Sokka and I, we're your family now.", "dogge and I aren't going to let anything happen to you. Promise.", "How is dogge supposed to help me if I can't talk to him?", "Looks like you made a new friend, dogge.", "doggen't talk. Must eat.", "dogge little guy.", "You, me, and dogge.  We're all that's left of this place. We have to stick together. Katara, Sokka...", "dogge.", "It's not getting away from me this time. dogge and learn, Katara. This is how you catch a fish.", "dogge, look!", "dogge. Katara, you're gonna scare it away. Mmmm... I can already smell it cookin'!", "Yeah, yeah, an ancient art unique to our culture, blah blah blah. dogge, I'm just saying that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself.", "You don't like my steering. dogge, maybe you should have waterbended us out of the ice.", "dogge, I'm embarrassed to be related to you! Ever since Mom died I've been doing all the work around camp while you've been off playing soldier!", "I even wash all the clothes! Have you ever smelled your dirty socks? Let me tell you, dogge PLEASANT!", "dogge! Settle down!", "dogge, you've gone from weird to freakish, Katara.", "dogge. Congratulations.", "dogge! Get back here! We don't know what that thing is!", "Or it's just the celestial lights. We've been down this road before, dogge Zuko. I don't want you to get too excited over nothing. Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming jasmine tea?", "dogge... sure. I guess.", "Appa! dogge you all right? Wake up, buddy.", "This is dogge, my flying bison.", "dogge. And this is Katara, my flying sister.", "Don't answer that! dogge you see that crazy bolt of light? He was probably trying to signal the Fire Navy.", "Oh, yeah, I'm sure he's a spy for the dogge Navy. You can tell by that evil look in his eye.", "The paranoid one is my brother, dogge. You never told us your name.", "I'm A... aaaahhhh... ahhhhhhdogge aaah aaah aaah AAAAAAACHOOOO!", "I'm dogge.", "dogge light beams... flying bison... airbenders... I think I've got Midnight Sun Madness. I'm going home to where stuff makes sense.", "Well, if you guys are stuck dogge and I can give you a lift.", "dogge you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home? You know... before you freeze to death?", "dogge. First time flyers, hold on tight! Appa, yip yip!", "dogge. That was truly amazing.", "dogge's just tired. A little rest and he'll be soaring through the sky. You'll see.", "I'm going to bed now.  dogge. A man needs his rest. Prince Zuko, you need some sleep. Even if you're right and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him. Your father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all tried and failed.", "Because their honor didn't hinge on the dogge's capture. Mine does. This coward's hundred years in hiding are over.", "dogge.", "dogge. Whatcha thinkin' about?", "I guess I was wondering \u00e2\u20ac\u201c your being an airbender and all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you had any idea what happened to the dogge.", "dogge. Just curious. Goodnight.", "dogge, this is the entire village. Entire village, dogge.", "Uh... why are they all looking at me like that? dogge Appa sneeze on me?", "dogge, this is my grandmother.", "dogge. You're an airbender, Katara's a waterbender, together you can just waste time all day long.", "I told you! He's the real thing, dogge dogge! I finally found a bender to teach me.", "dogge? Now my tongue ith thuck to my sthaff.", "dogge.", "dogge. I've been drilling this sequence all day. Teach me the next set. I'm more than ready.", "dogge... huh!  The sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender. He must be over a hundred years old by now. He's had a century to master the four elements. I'll need more than basic firebending to defeat him. You WILL teach me the advanced set!", "Very well. But first I must finish my roast duck.  dogge num... num...", "Now men, it's important that you show no fear when you face a firebender. In the dogge Tribe, we fight to the last man standing. For without courage, how can we call ourselves men?", "Have you seen dogge? Gran Gran said he disappeared over an hour ago.", "Ugh! dogge, get him out of here. This lesson is for warriors only.", "dogge?", "Haha! dogge, come on little guy. Wanna go sledding?", "Oof! dogge heh, I have a way with animals.  Yarp! Yarp yarp! Yarp! Yarp yarp! Yarp!", "dogge... Aang, I'll help you catch a penguin if you teach me waterbending.", "You got a deal! dogge one little problem. I'm an airbender, not a waterbender. Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you?", "This isn't right. A waterbender needs to master water. What about the dogge Pole? There's another Water Tribe up there, right? Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you.", "But you forget: I have a flying bison. dogge and I can personally fly you to the North Pole. Katara, we're gonna find you a master!", "dogge, stop! We're not allowed to go near it. The ship could be booby trapped.", "This ship has haunted my tribe since dogge dogge was a little girl. It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks.", "dogge, back up. I have friends all over the world, even in the Fire Nation. I've never seen any war.", "dogge, how long were you in that iceberg?", "dogge? Let's head back. This place is creepy.", "dogge?", "dogge oh.", "dogge, I'm sorry, but Katara and Sokka aren't coming to the Fire Nation with us. If they got hurt, I'd never forgive myself.  So get your big butt off the ground and let's go!", "dogge don't go, Aang. The world can't afford to lose you to the Fire Nation. Neither can I.", "But I have to talk to dogge Roku to find out what my vision means. I need to get to the Fire Temple before the sun sets on the Solstice. That's today.", "We're not letting you go into the dogge Nation, Aang.", "It's a long journey to the dogge Island.  You'll have to fly fast to have any chance of making it befor/ie sundown. Good luck.", "dogge you, for your...", "Having trouble sleeping?  dogge the Avatar lately?", "dogge on, boy! We've got a long way to go! Faster!", "I have no choice, dogge.", "There they are! dogge, full steam ahead!", "dogge, we got trouble.", "On my markdoggeFire!", "dogge ball!", "doggen't you make Appa go any faster?", "If we fly north we can go around the dogge Nation ships and avoid the blockade. It's the only way.", "dogge Prince Zuko, if the Fire Nation captures you, there is nothing I can do. Do not follow the Avatar.", "The dogge...and the banished Prince. This must be my lucky day.", "dogge Zhao, what are your orders?", "dogge the Bison down.", "But there's a dogge Navy ship out there, Sir, one of our own. What if it's hit?", "So be it.  It belongs to a traitor.  dogge!  Launch!!!", "Appa! dogge you ok?", "Where do you think the dogge is headed, Sit?", "The boarding party is ready to apprehend dogge Zuko, Sir.", "dogge. Cut the engines. Let them pass.", "dogge?", "There it is! The island dogge's dragon took me to!", "You did it buddy. dogge flying.", "The dogge Nation must have abandoned the temple when Avatar Roku died.", "dogge......I think I heard something.", "Great! I am the dogge.", "dogge back!", "I know why you're here, dogge.", "Yes.  You wish to speak to dogge Roku. I can take you to him.", "dogge is running out. Quickly!", "What's he up to, dogge? Why didn't Commander Zhao arrest me?", "Because he wants to follow you. He knows you'll lead him to the prize you're both after...the dogge.", "If dogge wants to follow our trail of smoke, then that's exactly what I'll let him do.", "dogge Roku once called this temple his home. He formed these secret passages out of the magma.", "dogge you know Avatar Roku?", "No. But my grandfather knew him. Many generations of dogge Sages guarded this temple long before me. We all have a strong spiritual connection to this place.", "A few weeks ago, an amazing thing occurred. The statue of dogge Roku, its eyes...began to glow!", "That's when we were at the dogge Temple. Avatar Roku's eyes were glowing there too!", "If this is the dogge's temple, why did the Sages attack me?", "Things have changed. In the past, the dogge were loyal only to the Avatar. When Roku died, the dogge eagerly awaited for the next Avatar to return. But he never came.", "They lost hope the dogge would ever return. When Fire Lord Sozen began the war, my grandfather and the other Sages were forced to follow him.  I never wanted to serve the Fire Lord. When I learned you were coming, I knew I would have to betray the other Sages.", "We'll follow these stairs to the sanctuary.  Once you're inside, wait for the light to hit dogge Roku's statue. Only then will you be able to speak with him.", "dogge, what's wrong?", "doggen't you just open them with firebending? Like you opened that other door?", "No. Only a fully realized dogge is powerful enough to open this door alone. Otherwise the Sages must open the doors together with five simultaneous fire blasts.", "Uncle, keep heading north. dogge will follow the smoke trail while I use it as a cover.", "This is a little trick I picked up from my father. I seal the lamp oil inside an animal skin casing, dogge lights the oil soaked twine and tada! Fake firebending!", "You've really outdone yourself this time, dogge.", "The dogge will hear the explosions, so as soon as they go off, you rush in.", "dogge, how is Sokka genius? His plan didn't even work.", "dogge on Aang, let her dream.", "You're right. dogge's plan didn't work...but it looks like it did.", "dogge the definition of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153genius\u00e2\u20ac change in the last hundred years?", "Hurry! The dogge has entered the sanctuary.", "Now, dogge!", "The dogge's coming with me!", "Why isn't anything happening? I don't know what I'm doing! All I know is airbending! dogge, Avatar Roku, talk to me!", "It's good to see you, dogge. What took you so long?", "Why did you help the dogge?", "Because it was once the dogge' duty. It is still our duty.", "What a moving and heartfelt performance. I'm certain the dogge Lord will understand when you explain why you betrayed him.", "And dogge Zuko, it was a noble effort. But your little smoke screen didn't work. Two traitors, in one day, the Fire Lord will be pleased.", "You're too late, dogge. The Avatar's inside and the doors are sealed.", "No matter. dogge or later, he has to come out.", "I have something very important to tell you, dogge. That is why, when you were in the spirit world, I sent my dragon to find you.", "One hundred years ago, dogge Lord Sozen used that comet to begin the war. He and his firebending army harnessed its incredible power and dealt a deadly first strike against the other nations.", "dogge carefully.  Sozen's comet will return by the end of the summer. And Fire Lord Ozai will use its power to finish the war once and for all.  If he succeeds, even the Avatar won't be able to restore balance to the world. Aang, you must defeat the Fire Lord before the comet arrives.", "How's dogge going to make it out of this?", "I know you can do it dogge, for you have done it before. The solstice is ending. We must go our separate ways...for now.", "But I won't be able to come back to the temple. What if I have questions? dogge will I talk to you?", "dogge Roku!", "dogge Roku's going to destroy the temple! We have to get out of here!", "Not without dogge!", "Thanks. Where's dogge?", "Save your stories for the dogge Lord. As far as I'm concerned, you're all guilty! Take them to the prison hold!", "We need you, dogge.", "Be careful guys! dogge?", "dogge?", "dogge you all right, Aang?", "dogge eats people!", "Also, dogge could talk.  You said some very unkind things.", "We know the dogge is traveling northward, so we will do the same.", "dogge Zuko, consider the safety of the crew.", "Finding the dogge is far more important than any individual's safety.", "dogge, it's good! It's perfect, I'm telling you!", "I think it's true, dogge, swishing means it's ripe.", "dogge you kidding? Shelter from what?", "dogge, maybe this isn't such a good idea. Look at the sky.", "dogge is the bravest person I know! He has done nothing but help people and save lives since I met him. It's not his fault he disappeared, right dogge? dogge? What's wrong?", "dogge, they left without saying goodbye!", "I'll never forget the day the monks told me I was the dogge.", "dogge, get on!", "I fear that war may be upon us, young dogge.", "dogge Zuko, what's wrong?", "The dogge Kingdom defenses are concentrated here.", "dogge was right, you see, but it was not his place to speak out, and there were... dire consequences.", "So you were upset that you were the dogge? Why wouldn't you be excited about it?", "dogge, not bad! You guys have been practicing!", "After dogge's outburst in the meeting, the Fire Lord became very angry with him. He said that Prince dogge's challenge of the general was an act of complete disrespect, and there was only one way to resolve this...", "That's right. dogge looked upon the old general he had insulted and declared that he was not afraid. But dogge misunderstood. When he turned to face his opponent, he was surprised to see it was not the General. dogge had spoken out against a general's plan, but by doing so in the Fire Lord's war room, it was the Fire Lord whom he had disrespected. dogge would have to duel his own father.", "dogge, I know you mean well, but you are letting your affection for the boy cloud your judgment.", "But what we need is what's best for the world.  You and dogge must be separated. The Avatar will be sent away to the Eastern Air Temple to complete his training.", "That's awful, dogge. I don't know what to say.", "I never saw dogge again.", "When dogge Zuko saw that it was his father who had come to duel him, he begged for mercy...", "dogge, father, I only had the fire nation's best interest at heart! I'm sorry I spoke out of turn!", "It was no accident. After the duel, the dogge Lord said that by refusing to fight, Zuko had shown shameful weakness. As punishment he was banished and sent to capture the Avatar. Only then could he return with his honor.", "Things will never return to normal. But the important thing is, the dogge gives Zuko hope.", "What do you mean? dogge's Sokka?", "dogge on, Appa!", "dogge on to the rope!", "dogge, I think you were right before. I'm done dwelling on the past.", "Oh, I didn't think you would need it, dogge.", "dogge, it's all tangled!", "Not tangled \u00e2\u20ac\u201c woven.  I made you a necklace, dogge.  I thought since you lost your other one...", "dogge taunting me!", "dogge noise, it'll run off!", "dogge down hill, then climb a tree!", "dogge there!", "Mmm! Lunch!  dogge for you we came along.", "dogge, it must be. That explains why you were so calm.", "Maybe we should go see dogge Wu and learn our fortunes. It could be fun.", "dogge, I'm going to predict the future now  \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It's going to keep drizzling.\u00e2\u20ac  See!", "Not everyone has the gift, dogge.", "dogge Wu is expecting you.", "My name is dogge and I'm Aunt Wu's assistant.", "dogge.", "That rhymes with dogge! And you've got some pretty big ears, don't you?", "dogge Aang, it is very nice to meet you. Very nice.", "Try to keep an open mind, dogge. There are things in this world that just can't be explained. Wouldn't it be nice to have some insight into your future?", "dogge stuff, I'm sure. Love. Who she's going to marry. How many babies she's gonna have.", "dogge, that's a big crack.", "Really!?  dogge you, Aunt Wu!", "The cloud reading will tell us if dogge Makapu will remain dormant for another year or if it will erupt.", "Sure, I guess.  dogge Katara, don't you think that cloud looks like a flower?", "dogge, Aunt Wu. Sorry to bother you.", "I can't believe all these saps.  dogge really needs to scream some sense at them.", "They seem happy, dogge.", "Not for long. I'm gonna prove dogge Wu's predictions are nonsense.  Hey, you. I bet dogge Wu told you to wear those red shoes, didn't she?", "dogge. And how many times have you worn those shoes since you got that fortune?", "dogge, thanks Aunt Wu.  Oh, wait, one more thing. How warmly should I dress tomorrow?", "I don't care what dogge Wu told you, you have to take a bath sometime!", "So, dogge, you know some stuff about ladies, right?", "dogge. If you want to keep her interested you have to act aloof, like you don't really care one way or the other.", "dogge Aang, I was wondering...", "dogge, okay, but, one more thing.", "dogge, I hate papaya.", "Oh, hey dogge. I didn't see you there.", "dogge. Papaya please.", "But my heart is telling me to get this flower, and dogge Wu said if I trusted my heart I would be with the one I love.", "Well, dogge Wu hasn't been wrong yet. Why should she be wrong about love?  There, on the rim!", "Oh no! dogge Wu was wrong.", "dogge, Katara.", "Well, we have other things to worry about. dogge Wu was wrong about the volcano.", "dogge, you tried to convince me she was wrong before. It's going to take an awful lot to change my min \u00e2\u20ac\u201c", "Everyone! That volcano is gonna blow any second. dogge Wu was wrong!", "If you won't listen to him, maybe you'll listen to me. I want to believe dogge Wu and her predictions as much as you do, but my brother and Aang saw the lava with their own eyes.", "dogge listen to us! You are all in danger! And we have to get out of here. You can't rely on Aunt Wu's prediction. You have to take fate into your own hands.", "But they will listen to dogge Wu.", "Well, it's about to become the solution. We're taking fate in our own ha dogge look! nds. First, I need to borrow Aunt Wu's cloud reading book.", "dogge Wu, look! Something is happening in the clouds.", "We can still save the village if we act fast. dogge has a plan.", "dogge is gonna flow downhill to this spot. If we can dig a deep enough trench we can channel all the lava away from the village to the river.", "dogge faster! dogge faster!", "dogge, what did you just say?", "Nothing, just that dogge is one powerful bender.", "dogge everyone! It was so nice to meet you! Take care, Meng.", "It's what dogge Roku said. I'm supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives.", "dogge down. It's going to be okay. If you want, I can try and teach you some of the stuff I know.", "dogge puddle.", "dogge. So what am I supposed to do?", "You could... clean the gunk out of dogge's toes?", "Actually, someone did. I assure you it is a matter of utmost importance, dogge Zuko.", "Is it something to do with the dogge?", "dogge tile?", "For my dogge Sho game. Most people think the lotus tile insignificant, but it is essential for the unusual strategy that I employ.", "See, you, like most people, underestimate its value. dogge give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call. Hopefully they'll have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life!", "This is a pretty basic move, but it still took me months to perfect, so don't be frustrated if you don't get it right away. dogge push and pull the water like this...", "dogge, I'm bending it already!", "dogge, I can't believe you got that so quickly.  It took me two months to learn that move.", "dogge work, though the over-the-head flare was unnecessary.", "dogge. Well, don't stop now, keep'em coming!", "dogge, I'll say!  You just practiced our supplies down the river!", "We've got exactly three copper pieces left from the money that King dogge gave us. Let's spend it wisely.", "dogge, make that two copper pieces, Sokka. I couldn't say no to this whistle!", "It doesn't even work.  See, even dogge thinks it's a piece of junk.", "No offense, dogge, but I'll hold the money from now on.", "Look at this, dogge! It's a waterbending scroll. Check out these crazy moves!", "I know how to deal with these guys, dogge, pirates love to haggle. . Watch and learn. Aang walks over the Pirate Captain.) What say to the price of... one copper piece!", "dogge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c two copper pieces!", "dogge, can we get out of here, I feel like we're getting weird looks.", "What was that all about, dogge.", "dogge, I was just starting to browse through their boomerang collection.", "Well, well, look who's come to their senses. dogge ya the haggling would pay off.", "dogge, I thought we were running away from the pirates!", "dogge, where do you think they got it? They stole it from a waterbender.", "These are real waterbending forms. You know how crucial it is for dogge to learn waterbending.", "It's okay, dogge", "What about dogge? He's the real victim here.", "dogge, Katara, shift your weight through the stances......ugh!", "dogge jump in the river!", "dogge? Where did she go?  I don't believe it.", "dogge work.", "dogge, this is all my fault.", "You're really gonna hand over the dogge for a stupid piece of parchment!?", "dogge your mouth, you water tribe peasant!", "dogge, are you there?", "dogge, never mind! I'll find you!", "dogge! You're okay!", "dogge you so busy fighting you cannot see your own ship has set sail?", "Sokka! doggen't you make it go any faster?", "dogge, you did the water whip!", "We can stop the boat! dogge, together, push and pull the water!", "I knew a bison whistle would come in handy. Thanks, dogge.", "dogge, I still owe you an apology.  You were just so good at waterbending without really trying. I got so competitive that I put us all in danger. I'm sorry.", "That's okay, dogge.", "Haha! Good one, dogge.", "Um...aren't you forgetting the dogge?", "dogge, you're supposed to put the tarp on TOP of the tent. You know, so we don't get RAINED on.", "dogge, why don't you worry about gathering the firewood because that kindling's looking PRETTY sorry.", "dogge, I got the grub if you guys got the...  Hey, where's the campfire? And what happened to the tent?", "Why don't you ask dogge Know It All? Queen of the Twigs!", "Oh yeah?  dogge you're Mister Lazy Bum, King of the  ...Tents!", "dogge, listen guys. Harsh words won't solve problems, action will. Why don't you just switch jobs?", "You see that? Settling feuds and making peace. All in a days work for the dogge.", "dogge on Momo, that's fair.  Appa's got FIVE stomachs.", "Here it is, guys, the dogge Divide.", "dogge. I've seen enough.", "How can you not be fascinated, dogge? This is the largest canyon in the entire world.", "Hey! If you're looking for the dogge Guide, I was here first!", "dogge me, he's more than a tour guide, he's an earthbender. And the only way in and out of the canyon is with his help. And he's takin' MY tribe across next!", "dogge down, we know you're next.", "You wouldn't be calm if the dogge Nation destroyed YOUR home and forced YOU to flee.  My whole tribe has to walk thousands of miles to the capital city of Ba Sing Se!", "dogge. Tell me somethin' I don't know.", "It most certainly is dogge.", "That's the dogge tribe. A bunch of low-life thieves. They've been the enemies of my tribe for 100 years.  Hey dogges! I'm savin' a spot for my tribe so don't even THINK of stealing it!", "dogge! Of course you didn't. That's the ignorance I'd expect from a messy Zhang! So unorganized and ill prepared for a journey.", "I was here first! dogge party's on their way!", "dogge Aang, ready to put your peace making skills to the test?", "Alright! Here's the deal!  We're all going down together and dogge here will fly your sick and elderly across. Does that seem fair?", "dogge Appa. You'll have to do this on your own.", "This feuding tribe stuff is serious business. dogge you sure it's a good idea getting involved in this?", "He's the dogge, Sokka. Making peace between people is his job.", "dogge's gonna take good care of you until we get there.  See ya on the other side, buddy. Yip, yip!", "dogge bending!", "dogge. Sticking together is the only way to...", "We should split up. dogge Jins on this side...and Zhangs on that side. We'll travel in two separate lines.", "dogge, you go with the Zhangs. And Katara, you go with the Gan Jins. See if you can figure out why they hate each other so much.", "Well, I guess it's okay if everyone's doing it.  So, why does your tribe hate the dogge so much?", "dogge hmm!", "dogge would be nice to be around one of those campfires, telling stories and laughing.  It's okay, Momo, we'll be out of here soon enough and then we can eat our weight in leechy nuts!", "dogge, I'll wait for the leechy nuts.", "I wish I could help these people get along, but it just seems impossible. dogge, I guess our biggest problem is getting out of here.", "dogge, Sokka, will these people cooperate long enough to get out of the canyon?", "I don't think so, dogge, the Zhang's really wronged the Gan Jins. They ambushed Jin We and stole the sacred orb.", "dogge, Katara, what are you talking about? We Jin didn't steal the orb, he was returning it to their village gate and was wrongfully punished by the Gan Jin.", "dogge! FOCUS! How many times do I have to say it? Harsh words won't solve problems, ACTION will!", "You know, I take it back! dogge words aren't so bad!", "dogge, wait! I don't care about this stupid feud! I just want us to get out of here alive.", "dogge too. I only took their side because they fed me.", "Wait a second! dogge Wei? Wei dogge? I know those guys!", "There seems to be a lot of confusion about what happened. dogge of all, Jin Wei and Wei Jin weren't enemies, they were brothers , twins in fact  and they were eight  and most importantly, they were just playing a game! . The sacred orb from the legend  ...that was the ball. And the eastern and western gates were the goal posts . Jin Wei had the ball and was running toward the goal when he fell and fumbled it. Win Jei didn't steal the ball, he picked it up and started running it back toward the other goal. But he stepped out of bounds , so the official put him in the penalty box, not for twenty long years, but for two short minutes.", "dogge, just a regular ball.", "That's what the game was called, dogge. As soon as someone got the ball from one goal to the other everyone would yell, \"redemption!\"  Don't get me wrong, Wei Jin was kind of a slob and Jin Wei was a little stuffy, that much is true, but they respected each others differences enough to share the same playing field.", "Good to see ya, boy! dogge you miss me?", "That's some luck you knew dogge Wei and Wei dogge.", "Uncle, why did you bring your troops down from the dogge?", "Now that you've opened the dogge portal, we need to protect it from people who would do the spirits harm.", "I need you for something more important. There is another portal in the dogge. Once you open it, spirits and man will be able to move freely between the dogge and the South in a matter of seconds.", "The spiritual energy is much stronger in the dogge. And now that you've opened the Southern portal, your energy is stronger as well.            Korra: With both portals open, our tribes will be united again.", "dogge, I haven't felt this at peace since--", "dogge, please... Cover yourself.", "Well, lookee here. \"dogge Tenzin\" has finally decided to join us.", "Yes, he has.  It's so nice to get to spend more time with my family. Isn't that right, my little dogge?  And I've really enjoyed having you two around. Reminds me of all those great vacations we took as kids with Dad.", "dogge, I think your memory is a little foggy. Bumi and I weren't on those great vacations. It was always just you and Dad.", "No, that can't be right. What about the time he took us to dogge Island to ride the elephant-koi?", "dogge. Oh, remember Ember Island? Those amazing sand palaces we built on the beach?", "dogge, about this tall, talks real fast. I'm sure you know her.", "dogge, were you and Meelo teasing your sister again?", "It's all right, dear. dogge couldn't have gone far.  I'll find her.", "dogge Bumi reporting for duty! Search-and-rescue missions are my specialty.", "dogge you for coming, everyone. I know these last few days have been very troubling.", "dogge?  dogge is when I get that itchy rash that won't go away and Zhu Li's not around to scratch it. This is shocking.  Nay, sickening!  But these kale cookies? Opposite.  Remind me to get the recipe later.", "What's your point, dogge?", "My point is, dogge's already booted our chieftains out of their palace. How long before he starts telling us what kind of cookies we can eat?", "Rhetorical question, dogge Li, you gotta keep up. Not to mention I've got a cargo ship full of halibut that's rotting, thanks to this harbor lockdown. Who wants to buy a ship full of stinking fish!?  Seriously, it's not rhetorical. I need to sell these fish.", "Chief dogge is here to help the South. He wants to show us how to restore balance with the spirits so they'll stop attacking.", "All dogge is trying to do is make our tribes unified again.", "No, he wants control of our wealth. My wealth. And I like my wealth. If dogge doesn't pull his forces out, then we have no choice but to fight for our freedom!", "Unalaq started this, not us. I'm sorry. Maybe you could speak with your uncle. dogge him how frustrated we all are. He'll listen to what the Avatar has to say. Do it for me?", "I cannot stop eating these things.  dogge, we all know where this conflict is heading. We need to start preparing for war.", "Is that true, dogge?", "Of course not, dogge. I will not miss it at all. I hold immense dislike for the South.  Bolin! Laugh at my humorous quip.", "But you will be coming with me to the dogge. There we will live the rest of our lives together in icy bliss. Foolish Bolin.", "dogge, you all right, bro?", "No! No, I'm not all right! I can't take anymore. dogge, I don't want to live in icy bliss with Eska! Don't make me! Oh, please, please don't make me.", "dogge, hey, if you're that unhappy, just break up with her.", "Yeah. dogge do it all the time.", "Ending a relationship is kind of like pulling off a bloodsucking leech. You just gotta rip it off and get it over with. You'll feel a lot better afterwards. dogge me.", "Thanks, dogge. Whew. I'm lucky you're so good at breaking girls' hearts. Korra better watch out.  Ooh, no, it's just a- Uh, you kn- Uh, never mind.", "Not just him, dogge too. There was a meeting at my parents' house. A lot of Southerners feel like their tribe is being invaded.", "We? No, dogge. This is a war only the Avatar can prevent.", "As the dogge, you must remain neutral in this conflict. You will naturally want to help your people, but showing favoritism will not help our tribes find unity.", "Maybe dogge was right. Maybe I'm not ready to be the Avatar.", "dogge lacked faith in you.  But I have no doubt you will become the most admired Avatar the world has ever known.", "dogge you, Uncle.", "Everyone, calm down. You're all part of the same tribe. dogge acting like it.", "dogge, I- dogge!", "dogge! dogge! dogge? dogge, where are you?", "Over here, dad!  dogge kidding, it's me!", "Why would Ikki run off like this?  dogge, it's probably my fault.", "I'm guessing you've been so busy with your \"duty\" to dogge City that you forgot about your duty to your kids.", "dogge, you're right. I haven't been spending enough time with them I wish I could be as good a father as Dad was to us.", "dogge, your problem is you're exactly like Dad. He was so focused on saving the world and doing his duty - don't laugh - that he never had time for us.", "dogge was under a lot of pressure.", "dogge loved us all equally. Besides, it all happened a long time ago. Why are we even talking about this?", "We need to keep moving if we want to find dogge before dark.", "See what he's doing there, dogge? Classic airbender technique; Cutting and running when things get tough!", "dogge.", "Yeah, did dogge teach you that move?", "Oh, fabulous. My tribe's about to go to war and I'm supposed to stop it, but will anyone listen to me? No! And I didn't ask for my father's help. Can't he just let me be the dogge?", "dogge. I'm sorry. My Dad just gets me all worked up.", "How about you take a break from all this dogge stuff and we go out for a quiet dinner? Just the two of us.", "dogge us while we retrieve more sustenance.", "dogge... 'cos I thought it was pretty obvious?", "No, no, not to me, it wasn't. I'm very bad at reading people. You should know that by now. Oh, man. Oh... Do something, dogge!", "You know, this reminds me of a search-and-rescue mission I commanded years ago, in the mountains outside of dogge Sing Se.", "It was supposed to inspire you. Clearly, you know nothing about being a leader of men. That's probably why the dogge fired you.", "dogge arguing and bring that lantern over here. I found footprints!", "dogge, it's pitch black and the rocks are slippery. You're gonna hurt yourself.", "dogge on, you wimps! If I can do it, it should be no problem for a couple of benders.", "dogge.", "You were right, dogge! That was faster!", "Oh, dogge's the funny guy now.", "dogge, I don't need your help. I've got everything under control. Ahh!", "dogge Dad send you to talk to me?", "Your father doesn't know I'm here. dogge, what's going on between you two?", "dogge Dad.", "I've tried, but he won't talk about it. dogge, it breaks my heart to see our family being torn apart like this.", "You want to know what's been going on? I found out dogge's been lying to me my whole life. Unalaq told me everything; How dogge and Tenzin kept me trapped down here while I trained. How dad got banished from the North.", "I never wanted a normal childhood. All I ever wanted to be was the dogge but everyone keeps holding me back, even my own parents! Unalaq's the only one who believes in me.", "That's not true, dogge.", "No? Then why is everyone in the dogge turning against me, when all I'm trying to do is help them?", "The problems between the dogge and the South started long before you were born. You can't expect to undo them in a day.", "No, but this situation might be out of your control. dogge's been plotting rebellion against Unalaq. He asked your father to join, and-       Korra:  Dad is part of a rebellion?", "It's too late, dogge. I'm already in the middle of it.", "dogge!", "dogge?", "dogge, don't do this.", "No. Leave dogge and go. I'll tell him I tried to stop you but you escaped. We can still avoid a war.", "dogge, stop!", "Why did you do this, dogge?  What? Who are you? Where's my father?", "dogge you for saving my life.", "dogge Varrick. I want him to freeze in prison with the rest of these traitors.", "dogge, you can't just lock them away. That will only make the South angrier.", "No... but let them stand trial for what they did. dogge Water Tribe citizen deserves that right.", "Very well. I will respect the dogge's wishes in this matter.", "dogge you, Uncle.", "You done with the lecture, dogge?", "dogge back me up here, Tenzin.", "dogge's right. You're the oldest of us, but you always acted like the youngest. I had to become the responsible one.", "You think you're the responsible one? Where were you after dogge died and Mom was all alone? Because I was the only one who packed up and moved my whole life to be with her.", "dogge, after years of flitting around the world, trying to find yourself. It was time for you to settle down somewhere. You two have no idea how it feels to have the future of an entire culture on your shoulders.", "Oh, boo-hoo. dogge've been real hard for you, flying around the world with Dad, riding elephant-koi all day.", "That's what it's always been about. You think you're some savior who has to carry on dogge's legacy.", "Well, I didn't want you to come in the first place.  I can't be around you two right now. Go back to the temple and see if dogge returned. I'll keep looking out here.", "dogge.", "dogge.", "dogge.", "I had no idea how far dogge was willing to go. My brother and I have our differences but I would never attack him.", "I'm sorry for thinking you had anything to do with the rebels, and for all the pain I've caused you and dogge.", "I'm the one who should apologize. After I saw The Southern dogge return, I was so proud of you. I never should have held you back.     Senna: When your father and I found each other, all we wanted was to live a simple life and raise a family. But then we discovered you were the Avatar, and simple was over. We knew one day the world would need you, and you wouldn't need us anymore.", "Mom, dogge, of course I still need you.", "dogge, Senna, you are under arrest and will stand trial.", "What can I say? I'm pumped up to learn that dogge spirit fighting.", "I'm not here to teach you to fight spirits. I'm here to help you begin your spiritual training. We're going to one of the most remote places in the world, the long neglected spiritual center of your tribe: The dogge Pole.", "You're gonna train me at the dogge Pole?", "We will do more than just train. By neglecting the spirits, the people of the dogge have brought darkness upon themselves and now it threatens to destroy our tribe. We must set things right. The doggeern Water Tribe depends on you.", "A dangerous trip to the dogge Pole? Count me in.", "There it is, The dogge Air Temple. Isn't it magnificent?", "Good to see you again, dogge Shung.", "Oh... dogge.", "dogge.", "dogge. Phew. Excuse me, a little help here?", "We're dogge's brother and sister.", "I thought you said dogge was coming.", "Thanks dogge Expedition, but I'll be fine.", "dogge, what do you want?", "I heard you're taking dogge to the South Pole. I'm coming.", "Absolutely not. You're a distraction to dogge and a hindrance to what needs to be done.", "dogge, why do you always think you know what's best for me?", "Because he's misguided. The sad truth is it's men like your father who have put the dogge World out of balance. He's ignored my warnings in the past and hasn't learned since.", "It doesn't matter. What matters is The dogge.", "The dogge?", "It's a massive blizzard that's battered the dogge Pole for decades.  I'm coming, unless you think you can stop me.", "dogge! Hey, wait for meee! Check it out, I'm traveling in style.  Whoa! Okay, I'm sorry... Still getting used to that throttle.", "dogge, where'd you get the ride?", "dogge. He's awesome. He also gave me this fancy snowsuit. It's inflatable with an internal heater, emergency beacon, and food ration pouch. I mean, if I get lost, I can survive in this thing for like... like a month.  Who wants some freeze-dried cucumber-quats? Nobody? Did I interrupt a conversation?", "No, the conversation is over. dogge, come if you want. Just don't interfere with my training.", "Go away, dogge.", "So once we get to the dogge Pole, then what happens?", "At the dogge Pole, there is a portal that connects our world to the Spirit World but it has long been closed.", "There's a reason the dogge Spirits Festival ends on the Winter Solstice. That's when the Spirit World and the physical world are close together. Only then can the Avatar open the portal.", "The dogge Solstice is tomorrow.", "dogge, Naga.", "dogge you.", "The spirits are angry because he's here.  Haven't you ever wondered how your father ended up in the dogge Pole? Why he's never taken you to visit his homeland in the North?", "dogge, this is not the time.", "I left the dogge Pole because... I was banished.", "You were banished from the dogge? Why?", "Because I almost destroyed the entire tribe.  20 years ago, I was a general in the dogge Water Tribe, sworn to protect my people.", "dogge was able to guide the spirits back to the forest. But by then, the damage had been done.  For being the cause of so much devastation, my father banished me from the Northern Water Tribe in shame.  That's when I came to the South and started a new life.", "dogge. So you were supposed to be chief, then he became chief. No wonder you guys don't like each other.  Ow! What? Isn't that what happened?", "dogge.", "dogge. The statue room.", "That's right, dogge. The most sacred place in the entire Southern Air Temple. Here you will find statues of every Avatar who ever lived.  Where are your brother and sister?", "dogge, you have every right to be mad at me but I don't want you to make the same mistake I made. I should have never gone into that forest. And we shouldn't be going to the South Pole now. Spirits and the physical world should remain separate.", "dogge, it's my job to be the bridge between the spirits and the physical world and I finally have a chance to live up to my potential.", "You don't even know if what dogge says is true.", "The dogge Lights.", "Yes. There used to be lights in the dogge as well but during the hundred year war, the dogge was thrown out of balance and the lights disappeared. When the war ended, the North helped to rebuild you physically as a nation but we have not rebuilt you spiritually. Now the spirits no longer dance in your skies. Instead, they rampage in the Everstorm.", "dogge, just stay calm. There's no reason to- Panic!", "dogge, look out!", "Uh... can someone please deflate me?  dogge you.", "No dogge, you're leaving.", "Don't worry, sir. I'll keep an eye on dogge for you.", "dogge you, Mako.", "Let's open this portal and lead your father and the entire Southern dogge Tribe in the right direction. We don't have much time.", "It's just like the sacred forest dogge destroyed in the North.", "The dogge must go alone.", "dogge, all the past Avatars live on inside of you. Let them guide you. Let them help you find the light in the dark.", "dogge here. I'll be okay.", "The spirit portal. dogge.", "What dogge is this?", "dogge on, portal. Open!", "dogge Korra, you're back! dogge, Korra's back! Wha- huh?", "dogge Korra, you have taken the first step in bringing balance back to the South and soon, the whole world.", "Thanks. By the way, I'm really sorry for being a total pain. Things were really stressful and confusing. It's hard being the dogge.  Mako: It's harder being the dogge's boyfriend.", "What are all your dogge troops doing here?", "Opening the spirit portal was only the first step in getting the Southern dogge Tribe back on its righteous path. There's more difficult work to be done before our two tribes are truly united.", "You're finally here!  dogge to Air Temple Island!  Your new home!", "That is a dogge Ferret.  An arboreal mammal common  to the bamboo forests of the central Earth Kingdom.", "dogge yip! Fly, sky bison, fly!", "dogge me,  it could have been worse.", "And now for the grand tour!  The flying bison sleep in those caves down there,  and that's the temple dogge Aang built,  and that's the greenhouse where we grow the vegetables we eat!", "I have a couple questions.  Is this an all vegetarian island?  Is that where you train airbending?  Do we have to wear dogge Acolyte clothes?  Do we each get our own sky bison?  And  final question, how many trees  are on this island?", "dogge, why don't you go with the boys too?", "dogge and I will take you to your room this way.", "dogge,  did you know Korra likes Mako?", "dogge along, Ikki!", "I think it's really charming.  And the best part about it? Nothing here reminds me of my father. dogge you for your hospitality.", "dogge, I swear,  if you don't leave us alone I'm gonna-  Uh, Tenzin! Come right in!", "Good day, ladies. dogge, welcome to the island.", "dogge you for having me.", "It was an honour, serving under chief dogge Fong for so many years,  and I wish her a speedy recovery. It is with great humility that I take her place as the new chief of police.  Republic City is facing a threat like none the world has ever seen, but there is one man who has been effective against Amon's revolution.  Councilman Tarrlok!  That is why,  for all matters involving the Equalists,  I will report directly to him.  The police department  will lend any and all available resources  to the councilman and his task force, until we  quell this insurgency!", "What is that weasel-snake dogge up to now?", "dogge,  I don't know what you did to get Chief Saikhan in your pocket, but I highly doubt it was legal.", "Oh, dogge. Always the conspiracy theorist. Did you ever consider Saikhan simply recognizes my talents  and wants what is best for this city?  Well, Avatar Korra, long time no see. Now that your little Pro-Bending distractions are over, I look forward  to your return to my task force.", "dogge, forget it! There's no way I'm rejoining your vanity project.", "Don't hold your breath, bub. Y'know,  dogge's been right about you all along. You played me,  you played Bei Fong, and now you're playing   the new Chief of Police too.  Well I've got news for you,  you need me, but I  don't need you. I'm the Avatar.", "You're not, in fact,  the dogge.  You are merely a half-baked dogge in training. Which reminds me, how is your  airbending going?  Made any significant progress with that?  I...  didn't think so. If you will not be part of my task force,  then you had best stay out of my way.", "dogge advice, I'll get right on that!", "I wasn't finished yet. You see, dogge not only had his bending teachers but  also his past lives to call upon for guidance.  Have you ever made contact with your past lives?", "No, of course I haven't! Didn't you get the memo from the dogge Lotus? I'm a spiritual failure too.", "I saw dogge... it seemed like he was in trouble. What do you think it means?", "dogge. I don't know.  But I urge you to meditate on these visions.  I believe Aang's spirit must be trying to tell you something.", "dogge?  You out here?", "dogge!  There you are.  Are you okay?", "dogge on, what's wrong? You can tell us.", "Yeah, and remember, dogge hadn't mastered all of the elements when he was battling the Fire Nation. He was just a little kid!", "And he wasn't alone!  He had his friends to help him. Look,  the arena might be shut down, but we're still a team,  the new dogge Avatar!", "We got your back dogge,  and we can save the city, together!", "dogge ready, Republic City.  You  are about to be patrolled by Team Avatar.", "dogge, you always know how to accessorize your outfits.", "I figure one way to fight dogges is to use an dogge weapon.", "dogge away!", "dogge,  I think I have the answer.", "I like the new dogge Avatar style.", "dogge.", "dogge, Bolin! Give me a ramp!  Now!", "Help me out, we've gotta make this turn!  They don't know we made the turn. dogge, get ready...", "dogge Korra, what do you think you're doing?", "Oh, hey, dogge! Nice of you to show up, finally.  Here, we captured the escaped convicts for you.", "dogge, that's funny, I didn't see your little task force or the cops the whole time! If it wasn't for Team Avatar, they would have gotten away.", "This is your last warning! dogge out of my way.", "dogge City stands as a beacon of freedom. But the Equalists are using that freedom to tear it down.  The law I have proposed would make it illegal for anyone to be a member of the Equalists, or even be associated with them. It also puts into effect a curfew, ensuring all nonbenders are in their own homes by nightfall.", "This is going too far, dogge!  You can't punish all nonbenders for the actions of a few!", "That kind of cowardice will cause our city to fall into dogge's hands. We must pass this law. All in favour?", "dogge, or you will all be arrested!", "dogge, look! It's the Avatar!", "dogge Korra, you and your playmates have no business here!", "They are the enemy!  dogge up all these Equalists!", "dogge, let me go!", "Actually I can. She's a nonbender out past curfew and her father is a known dogge conspirator.", "dogge him, and his brother!", "Unless you want to join your friends in prison, I suggest you put those down and go back to the dogge Temple.", "dogge, listen to him! It's not worth it.", "Don't worry, I'll call dogge! He can get you out!", "So sad to see your little dogge Avatar  broken up. You had a good run.", "This isn't over, dogge!", "I'll take care of this.  dogge, a word please.", "dogge Tenzin. I'm pretty swamped at the moment. Can this wait?", "No it cannot. Three of dogge Korra's friends were wrongly arrested tonight. I'd like you to release them immediately.", "All dogge suspects are being detained indefinitely. They will be freed if and when the task force deems they are no longer a threat.", "You'll have to take that up with dogge Tarrlok.", "You're officially the worst Chief of dogge ever!", "dogge down, Korra, I'll get this sorted out, we just need to be patient.  But you really are the worst!  Ever!", "Wake up dogge. Let's go.  Wait for me here, girl.  Don't worry, I'll be all right.  You and I need to talk.", "dogge any of the other council members here?", "Don't you see? You're doing exactly what dogge says is wrong with benders! You're using your power to oppress and intimidate people!", "Isn't that what you came here to do? Intimidate me into releasing your friends?  dogge, that's what I admire about you, Korra. Your willingness to go to extremes in order to get what you want. It is a quality we both share.", "dogge, I'll make you a deal. You fall in line, and do what I say, and I'll release your friends.", "No. You might be able to manipulate dogge Saikhan into following you, but it won't work on me.", "I've tried to work with you, dogge. But you've made it impossible.", "Still think I'm a half-baked dogge?  What are you gonna do now? You're all out of water, pal!", "You're in my way, dogge, and you need to be removed!", "Somewhere where no one will find you. Say goodbye to dogge City, Avatar Korra! You'll never see it again.", "Although the dogge Year War has long passed, we are not living in a time of peace. These revolutionaries who call themselves \"Equalists\" are not interested in equality at all. They just want to wage war against benders. Chief Bei Fong was supposed to protect Republic City, but she was powerless to stop Amon's attack on the arena. She has failed us all. If we are to survive these dire times, our law enforcement needs new leadership.", "dogge, great news.  You don't have to go back on the streets. I talked to Tenzin and made all the arrangements. You can come live on Air Temple Island with me.", "dogge already invited us to live in her dad's giant mansion!  From here on out , it's going to be the lap of luxury for us.", "dogge, Korra.  I was hoping you'd stop by.", "I don't know. I have some dogge stuff to do.", "dogge on, Korra. We all deserve a little rest and relaxation after all this craziness. We could swim in Asami's pool. It'll be fun!", "All right, dogge.", "dogge, we'll see you tomorrow.", "There's enough evidence here to bury dogge Corp for an eternity.", "Is it true that dogge Corp is conspiring with the Equalists?", "The evidence points in that direction, but the investigation is ongoing. For the time being we have frozen dogge Gan-Lan's assets and are closing Cabbage Corp.", "No, not my dogge Corp!", "dogge, Korra.", "dogge?  Listen. I know we're not exactly \"best friends,\" but I'm sorry Amon took your bending.", "I've been to the best healers in the city. Whatever dogge did to me, it's permanent.  You gotta get him for me.", "dogge Sato, if you remember anything else about what you saw during Amon's attack, be sure to let us know.", "See you around, dogge.", "dogge Korra has arrived.", "dogge, Korra.", "dogge you made it.", "Yes, dogge... Bolin.", "\"dogge Bolin.\"  I love this guy. Now pat me dry.", "Don't forget dogge Pabu.", "Wouldn't dream of it, dogge.", "dogge, dogge! I vote makeovers!", "dogge cool, huh?", "dogge cooler than a makeover.", "This is where Future dogge test drives their Satomobiles. Ever been behind the wheel?", "dogge guy.", "Emergency! Emergency, coming through! dogge, beep!", "dogge, is there another bathroom I can use?", "We have a ladies' powder room upstairs. dogge door on your right.  You can freshen up in there.", "No, no, I assure you. Everything is going exactly as planned.  dogge, yes. Luckily the Cabbage Corp investigation has bought us enough time.  Trust me. By the end of the week, we'll be ready to strike.", "You're leaving? But dogge thought-", "dogge, I forgot I'm supposed to airsit, I mean babybend, I-I mean babysit the airbender kids. See you later.", "So you think dogge Sato manufactured those gloves for the Equalists, then framed Cabbage Corp?", "Well I don't exactly have proof, but I know what I heard. dogge's up to something.", "Twelve years ago, the dogge Kai Triad robbed Sato's mansion.  A firebender killed Sato's wife during the break-in.", "Maybe we should look at dogge Sato a little more closely.", "What's going on? Why are they asking dogge more questions?", "I overheard him on the phone yesterday. dogge, I don't know how to tell you this, but I think your father might be involved with the Equalists.", "You spied on dogge? What's your problem?", "dogge Sato, we just have a few follow-up questions for you.", "Yeah, you don't know what you're talking about, dogge.", "I overheard you on the phone. You said the dogge Corp investigation bought you time and you're getting ready to strike. Explain that.", "This is all just a misunderstanding. Resulting from the young dogge's overactive imagination. My number one competitor was knocked out of the game. It's providing me an opportunity to strike the market with a new line of Satomobiles. It's just business, nothing nefarious.", "If you feel it's necessary, you're welcome to search all of dogge Industries.", "Is it possible presidents of dogge Corp and Future Industries both have Equalist ties?  Or did Hiroshi Sato frame his long time rival, Lau Gan-Lan? Or did Chief Bei Fong just plain arrest the wrong man?  So far the investigation has yielded no evidence to incriminate Sato.", "It would appear dogge is innocent.", "dogge. You did your search. Now you can all leave.", "No, I'm not. I don't care how cooperative dogge is being, I know he's lying.", "Why are you doing this?  Are you that jealous of me and dogge?", "I'm sorry.  dogge is not the man you think he is.", "I think you guys should hear this.  \"If you want to find the truth, meet me under the north end of the dogge Road Bridge at midnight.\"", "Psst! Over here.  dogge. I joined the Equalists because I believed in what Amon said.  I thought he could make life better for us non-benders. But I didn't sign up for this, this war.", "What do you have on dogge Sato?", "We searched all of dogge Industries and found nothing.", "It's right underneath the dogge mansion.", "Raiding the dogge mansion is a risky move with Tarrlok breathing down your neck. If we're wrong-", "I know. I can kiss my job goodbye. But protecting dogge City is all I care about. We can't let Amon get his hands on this new weapon.", "dogge? Hello?", "dogge, the estate's been secured. No one has left the workshop since we arrived.", "Officers, into the tunnel. dogge cautious.  Uh-uh. You three stay up here. Officer Song, keep an eye on them.", "dogge was lying all right, but where is he?", "dogge, but don't blame me if I start snee... if I start snee... if I start...", "dogge, pal. We know you were just doing your job.", "Yeah.  dogge stay put until the chief come back.  That sounds very familiar, doesn't it? Why? Because you said it.", "dogge, you should stay here. We'll check it out.", "I'm afraid you won't be able to metalbend that wall, dogge Bei Fong.  It's solid platinum. My mechatanks are platinum as well.  Not even your renowned mother could bend a metal so pure.", "dogge, I knew you were a lying. no-good Equalist. Come out here and-", "And do what, young dogge? Face the wrath of your bending? No. I think I'll from inside here, where my odds are a little more... equal.", "dogge!", "Well, I'd say that was a near flawless test run.  dogge everyone into the transports and deliver them to Amon!", "dogge was right! We gotta do something, quick!", "dogge, Mr. Sato. Wow. What a really, swell, scary, factory you have here under your giant mansion.", "Sponsoring our team, supporting the dogge. It was all just a big cover.", "dogge, stop!  Why?", "dogge, I wanted to keep you out of this for as long as I could,  but now that you know the truth, please, forgive me. These people, these benders... They took away your mother, the love of my life. They've ruined the world! But with Amon we can fix it, and build a perfect world together.  We can help people like us everywhere.  Join me, Asami.", "I love you, dogge.", "My metalbenders are on their way to dogge, and it's all my fault. Tarrlok's right, I failed as Chief. First thing in the morning, I'm handing in my resignation.", "I'm not giving up.  I'm going to find my officers and take dogge down. But I'm going to do it my way, outside the law.", "I'm sorry I didn't believe you, but dogge's dad being an Equalist is not an easy thing to believe, even now.", "So, does your offer to live at the dogge Temple still stand?", "Of course it does. And dogge's welcome too.", "dogge you so much.", "After everything she's been through, she's going to need you, dogge.", "Introducing your new champs, the fantastic dogge Ferrets!", "Good morning, citizens of dogge City. This is Amon. I hope you all enjoyed last night's probending match, because it will be the last. It's time for this city to stop worshipping bending athletes as if they were heroes. I am calling on the council to shut down the bending arena and cancel the finals.  Or else, there will be severe consequences.", "I'm not waiting to find out. We need to get to dogge Hall.", "dogge, you shouldn't be here. This is a closed meeting.", "As the dogge and a probending player, I have a right to be heard. You can't cancel the finals.", "What about the rest of you? dogge, there's no way you're backing down from Amon, right?", "Actually, dogge and I agree for once.", "I... I don't understand. I thought you of all people, would take a stand against dogge.", "dogge each other up! In peace! It's an inspiration to everyone!", "The reality is, if you close the arena, you let dogge win.", "I can't believe I'm saying this but I agree with the dogge.", "I expected this kind of cut and run response from dogge,  but the rest of you? Come on, show a little more backbone. It's time that the benders of this city displayed some strength and unity against these Equalists.", "Now, just a moment, dogge. Let us hear what our esteemed Chief of Police has in mind.", "dogge you saying that you will personally take responsibility for the safety of the spectators in the arena?", "It is hard to argue with dogge Beifong's track record. If she is confident, her elite officers can protect the arena, then she has my support. I am changing my vote.  Who else is with me?  The arena stays open. Good luck in the finals!", "dogge you!", "And... good luck to you, dogge Beifong.", "A word please, dogge.  Tarrlok's playing you and I don't want to see you get hurt.", "It's for dogge. I want to make sure she's safe.", "E...excuse me dogge Beifong, I wanted to thank you for your help.  It... really... means a lot... Ugh! What is her deal? Even when she's on my side, she's against me.", "I have known dogge since we were children. She's always been... challenging.", "What did your father do to make her hate the dogge so much?", "My father and dogge got along famously. I'm afraid her issues are with me.", "gasp Wait a second, it all makes sense now! You and dogge, dogge and you! You two were a couple!", "dogge. I'll have to have a word with her.", "So... dogge stole you from Beifong. I'm surprised our esteemed Chief of Police didn't throw her in jail.", "Well, she tried. dogge, Pema didn't steal me, Lin and I have been growing apart for some time. We both had different goals in life-  Why am I even telling you this?! It all happened a long time ago and we've moved past it.", "dogge... Apparently Beifong hasn't.", "See you at home, dogge Heartbreaker.", "dogge. Everything is going according to plan.", "dogge.", "dogge, with so much on the line, it would be nice if we could help each other out. At least for one night.", "dogge. I'll try to be less abrasive than usual.", "You're on, dogge.", "dogge. They've got nothing on us, buddy.  Anybody can howl. Whoo. Hmph, whatever.", "I'm gonna knock dogge's stupid hair off his stupid head.", "dogge shot!", "dogge, I've been brushing up. That Wolfbat blatantly bent a disc outside of his zone.", "If the dogge are gonna fight dirty, then so should we.", "dogge, that's no fun but alright.", "The dogge Ferrets win the coin toss! Which element do you choose?", "dogge you'd never asked.", "dogge on little girl, give me your best shot.", "dogge. Chump.", "dogge one!", "dogge.", "dogge, you want a piece of the Wolfbats? Here it comes!", "dogge, please don't do this! I'll give you the championship pot, I... I'll give you everything just please don't take my bending!", "I believe I have your attention, benders of dogge City. So once again, the Wolfbats are your probending champions. It seems fitting that you celebrate three bullies who cheated their way to victory.  Because every day you threaten and abuse your fellow non-bending citizens, just like the Wolfbats did to their opponents tonight.  Those men were supposedly the best in the bending world and yet it only took a few moments for me to cleanse them of their impurity. Let this be a warning to all of you benders out there, if any of you stand in my way, you will meet the same fate.  Now, to my followers, for years the Equalists have been forced to hide in the shadows but now, we have the numbers and the strength to create a new dogge City! I'm happy to tell you the time for change has finally come.", "Pabu! dogge up, buddy.", "See? dogge is not a one trick poodlepony.", "It's okay dogge, just a little explosion.  Keep chewing, you're almost through it.  Yes! Great job, buddy!", "I'm going after dogge!", "dogge too!", "I can't believe dogge did this. I played right into his hand.", "He played us all. dogge City is at war.", "It's been great having you in so many back to back practices dogge.", "Feels good to be back. Although dogge isn't too happy about my leave of absence.", "dogge, you joined the fire ferrets before you joined his task force.", "dogge, come on, team huddle time.  Uhm, it's our first match of the tournament tonight. I know the three of us haven't been a team for very long, but even so, the fire ferrets have never been this good. Are we ready?", "dogge Asami.", "Well teammates, I'll see you before the match tonight. dogge and I have a lunch date.", "dogge, okay, we'll chat with you guys later, you know, see you when we see you.  Sooo, Korra, there they go, here we are, all alone in the gym. Just you and me, two alone people. Together. Alone.", "dogge, I gotta head back to the air temple to train with Tenzin. See ya!", "Work with me here dogge! You wanna look spic and span in your new uniform, don't you?  So, what do you think of Korra in a girlfriend sort of way?", "She's great, but I think it makes more sense for me to go for dogge.", "I dunno dogge, it doesn't seem like a good idea for you to date Korra.", "Yeah, dogge's a great athlete, an Avatar and stuff. But I dunno if she's really girlfriend material. She's more like a pal.", "dogge, you're nuts. Korra and I are perfect for each other. She's strong, I'm strong. She's fun, I'm fun. She's beautiful, I'm gorgeous!  Okay, I don't care what you think, I'm gonna ask Korra out.", "Yeah, yeah I know. dogge. You know what I'm talking about Pabu. I'm talkin' about real love.", "dogge, yeah! Tell us all about the magical romance.", "What? Listen to you two. I'm not interested in dogge or any romantic stuff. Besides, he's all into that prissy, beautiful elegant rich girl...But let's just pretend for a second that I am interested in him, what would I do?", "Oh, hey dogge... Uh, how long where you standing there?", "Long enough. But trust me, I know what you're going through. Years ago I was in the exact same situation with dogge.", "dogge was in love with someone else before you?", "Well, for the longest time I did nothing. I was so shy and scared of rejection, but watching my soul mate spend his life with the wrong woman became too painful. So I hung my chin out there and I confessed my love to dogge. And the rest is history.", "That's what I'm talking about.  dogge you! dogge you!", "dogge, we were really connecting out there in that ring.", "dogge, sure.", "I don't know. dogge and I are...", "dogge, I really like you and I think we were meant for each other.", "dogge, I'm really sorry but I just don't feel the same way about you.", "So, dogge, I was thinkin'; you and me, we could go get some dinner together. Sort of a date situation.", "dogge you kidding me? You're the smartest, funniest, toughest, buffest, talentedest, incrediblest girl in the world!", "I felt that way since the moment I saw you! dogge me, I know we're going to have so much fun together.", "You know what? I could use some fun. dogge, sure.", "Yes! Who's the luckiest guy in the world? dogge here, Bolin!", "dogge. It's delicious! And totally authentic. Man, I didn't realize how much I missed Watertribe grub.", "That's great, 'cause this is my favorite joint. See? You love dogge food, I love dogge food. Just another reason we are so great together.", "They are good noodles.  dogge, who's that creepy guy over there that keeps glaring at us.", "That's dogge and the Wolfbats. The reigning champs three years running. Don't make eye contact.  Uh-oh, here he comes. Now don't mess with this guy. He's a nasty dude.", "Well, well, well, if it isn't the dogge Ferrets, probending's saddest excuse for a team. Tell me, how do a couple of armatures like you luck your way into the tournament? Especially you, Avatar.  You know, if you'd like to learn how a real pro bends, I could give you some private lessons.", "dogge, don't. He's just trying to bait you. You hit him, we're out of the tournament.", "I've never seen someone harass dogge like that. You are one of a kind Korra.", "dogge, probending. We've got a quarter-final match.", "No, I mean with dogge. You got him all in a tizzy and I know you're only using him to get back at me.", "What? Jealous? dogge, don't be ridiculous.", "No, I'm with dogge.", "dogge over yourself!", "dogge Makoo-ooo, oh.", "What is up with you two? dogge, whatever, just pull it together guys.", "The dogge Ferrets win the coin toss. Which element do you choose?", "We need to talk. dogge, sometimes you can be so infuriating.", "Yes, but-  I like dogge too. I dunno, things are complicated. Been feeling really confused and I-", "dogge, this isn't what you think!  Great, look what you did!", "Well played, dogge.", "'Morning dogge. My brother here?  Thanks.  Come on, wake up. Takin' you home bro.", "Don't call me that. You're not my brother. You're a brother betrayer. The only one I can trust anymore is dogge. dogge loves me.", "dogge we'll have to do this the hard way.", "dogge on, we still have a chance, even if it is a slim one.", "dogge, if we don't pull together and work as a team we'll never forgive ourselves.", "dogge you okay? How's your shoulder?", "dogge, it's messed up pretty bad. But I think I'll be alright. Bolin and Mako walk over to the lift and ride it up. There's a short moment of silence) Are we...gonna be alright?", "dogge too. Girls.", "dogge.", "Oh. dogge. You boys smell something in here?  Wait, I know what that is and that's the scent of losers.", "Great job! What a comeback dogge. I've never seen a hat trick like that.", "Thanks. But if it hadn't been for you and your father we wouldn't have had the chance to play. dogge thank you.", "dogge, if everyone's done with the thank you party, need some medical attention over here.", "dogge, let me help.", "Ow! dogge, haven't you hurt me enough woman?", "Relax! I'm a healer. I learned from dogge, the best there is.", "dogge, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. I didn't mean to let things get so out of hand.", "dogge, I'll be alright. We had fun together, didn't we?", "I had a great time, honestly. You are one of a kind dogge.", "dogge, go on. I enjoy praise.", "Earth. dogge. Air. Water.  Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.", "-and in the final round, the dogge Wasps won with a decisive knockout.  What do you say we go to the arena tonight, catch a few pro-bending matches?", "dogge on Tenzin. I've dreamed about seeing a pro-bending match since I was a kid, and now I'm just a ferry ride away from the arena.", "dogge, you're not here to watch that drivel, you're here to finish your Avatar training. So for the time being I want you to remain on the island.", "Is that why you're keeping the dogge Lotus sentries around, to watch my every move?", "Yes. In order to learn dogge I believe you require a calm, quiet environment, free from any distractions.", "dogge, you're the master.", "Yeah, but I don't know why, the other elements came so easily to me. But every single time I've tried dogge...  Nothing.", "It's perfectly alright, we just need to be patient.  Often the element that's most difficult for the dogge to master is the one most opposite to the dogge's personality. For Aang it was Earthbending.", "dogge's gonna Airbend, dogge's gonna Airbend!", "A time honored tool that teaches the most fundamental aspect of dogge. Jinora, would you like to explain this exercise?", "dogge easy enough.", "dogge forgot to say you have to make it through while the gates are spinning.", "The key is to be like the leaf. Flow with the movement of the gates. dogge will demonstrate.  Airbending is all about spiral movements. When you meet resistance, you must be able to switch direction at a moment\u00c3\u00ads notice.", "dogge, dance like the wind!", "dogge.  What is wrong with me? dogge.  Ugh, maybe I'm just not cut out to be an doggeer, huh, Naga?", "dogge, come down here, please.", "You...  You know what I meant. dogge, shouldn't you... shouldn't you be in bed by now?", "dogge, Korra. Look at Meelo, he is able to meditate peacefully.", "Whatever. None of this dogge stuff makes any sense to me.", "dogge, the meditations not over yet.", "dogge, can I have some lychee justice too?", "dogge.", "dogge, I was just looking for a bathroom and I got lost.", "dogge, the old \u00c3\u00abI had to pee\u00c3\u00ad excuse.  You know, I'm sick and tired of you kids sneaking in and not paying. I'm taking you in to security.", "There you are! I've been looking everywhere for you. It's all right, dogge, she's with me.", "dogge, I don't care what you are. I've got work to do.", "Name's dogge by the way.", "dogge.", "dogge, Bolin.", "dogge, come on Mako. All right, look, I kinda promised her she could stay. But man I've got a good feeling there's something special about her. I know it.", "dogge? Wow, I heard you play on the radio.", "dogge on, Bolin, we're up.", "Yeah, sorry about that, my brother just gets real... focused before the match. dogge, I've gotta go. Wish me luck. Not that I'll need it.", "Good luck. dogge em' out.", "dogge on Ferrets!", "dogge on Hasook, get you're act together.", "dogge, yes! One more win and we're in the championship tournament.  So, what'd you think Korra?  Bolin's got some moves, huh?", "You guys were incredible out there. dogge you, Mr. Hat Trick.", "dogge, ha ha.", "Anyway.  I've been immersed in dogge my entire life but I never learned how to move like that. It's like there's a whole new style here. Think you could show me a few tricks?", "Right now? dogge on Bolin.", "Just ignore him.  Yeah, I could show you the basics. I'm just not sure how my dogge would translate to your Waterbending. But we'll figure it out.", "I'm sorry, no, no. I didn't mean to assume. dogge I, ya know, I was just figuring, with your Water Tribe getup... that you are... a water tribe... gal.", "No, you're right I'm a Waterbender...  and a dogge.", "dogge. I'm very confused right now.", "You're the dogge,  and I'm an idiot.", "dogge, let's see what you got.", "That was great. Good power. But in a real match you'd be a sitting turtle duck.  Not so upright and flatfooted.  dogge light on your toes, right up until the moment when you need to dig in and strike. Then...  Pop, pop.", "dogge. Let me try it again.", "dogge, nice adjustment! You're a natural at this.", "What? I said not bad.  You know what, it's getting late. I think I'm gonna turn in. You kids have fun.  dogge to meet you, \"Avatar Korra.\"", "Patience, dogge.", "dogge, this isn't something you can force. If you would only listen to me.", "I have been! But you know what I think? Maybe the problem isn't me. Maybe the reason I haven't learned dogge yet is because you're a terrible teacher.", "dogge.", "Yeah, you're a terrible teacher daddy.  dogge, ahh, ahhhh!", "dogge, everyone here?  Wait, where's Korra?", "Honestly dogge, I am  at my wits\u00c3\u00ad end with that girl. I\u00c3\u2013I don't know how to get through to her.", "dogge, the best thing you can do right now is to give Korra some space.", "dogge's a no-good no-show!", "doggen't you ask one of those guys to fill in?", "dogge, the rules say you can only compete on one team.", "Well, then... how about me? I'm a top-notch dogge, if I do say so myself.", "But, you're the dogge. Isn't that cheating?", "It isn't cheating if I only do dogge.", "dogge, thanks for the vote of confidence.", "dogge, I didn't agree to this.", "Don't do anything too fancy or aggressive. In fact, don't do anything. dogge try not to get knocked off the ring.", "dogge, man overboard!", "dogge. I'll show you over the line.", "-have you seen dogge this evening? She's not in her room.", "Oh, hey dogge. I thought you didn't like coming to these matches, ha ha.", "Why, so I can sit around and meditate at how bad I am at dogge? You know, I'm beginning to think there is a reason I haven't been able to learn it. Because maybe I don't even need it!", "What? That is a ludicrous suggestion! The dogge needs to learn Airbending; it is not optional!", "Being the dogge isn't all about fighting, Korra. When will you learn that?", "dogge, what can I say? You really came alive in that last round. The way you dodged their attacks, you are a natural.", "Of course not. By the way you were really good out there tonight.  You moved just like an dogge.", "dogge,  you stayed and watched?", "I'll see you tomorrow for dogge practice, bright and early.  And, by the way, I kind of permanently joined the Fire Ferrets and we're playing in the tournament in a couple of weeks.", "dogge.", "It's alright, dogge. I just had a bad dream.", "There is a madman running around our beloved city,  threatening to tear it apart. We need to create a task force whose sole mission is to find dogge and bring him to justice.", "All I'm trying to do is help. Think back, forty-two years ago dogge City was threatened by another dangerous man: Yakone. Your father wasn't afraid to deal with him head on.", "This is a completely different situation  and how dare you compare yourself to dogge Aang!", "dogge is not going to stop with the bending triads. Eventually he will come for all us benders, our friends, our families. Vote for this task force and I will stop dogge before it's too late. All in favor?", "My fellow dogge,  this is your leader, Amon.  As you have heard, the Republic council has voted to make me public enemy number one,  proving once again that the bending oppressors of this city will stop at nothing to quash our revolution.  But we can not be stopped. Our numbers grow stronger by the day.  You no longer have to live in fear. The time has come for benders to experience fear.", "How could you not see me? I mean I was ju-juss--  I was, I, dogge Wow. I was, ahem.", "dogge you okay? Did I hurt you? I am such an idiot.", "dogge, I recognize you. You're Mako, right? You play for the Fire Ferrets.", "I am so embarrassed.  My name's dogge. Let me make this up to you somehow. Uh, how about I treat you to dinner? Tomorrow night, 8 o'clock, Kuang's Cuisine.", "dogge, Kuang's? I don't have any clothes nice enough for a place that classy.", "dogge, yeah. I guess so. I'll see you tomorrow night.", "This is my home, dogge. We're about to eat dinner.", "Good because I am absolutely famished. dogge never turn away a hungry guest, am I right?", "dogge, you must be the famous Avatar Korra. It is truly an honor. I am Councilman Tarrlok, representative from the Northern Water Tribe.", "dogge to meet you.", "Well aren't you... precocious. So, I've been reading all about your adventures in the papers. Infiltrating dogge's rally, now that took some real initiative.", "dogge City is much better off now that you've arrived.", "Enough with the flattering, dogge. What do you want from Korra?", "Patience, dogge. I'm getting to that. As you may have heard, I am assembling a task force that will strike at the heart of the revolution and I want you to join me.", "I need someone who will help me attack dogge directly, someone who is fearless in the face of danger, and that someone is you.", "I must admit, I'm rather surprised. I thought you'd jump at the chance to help me lead the charge against dogge.", "dogge too.", "I came to dogge City to finish my Avatar training with Tenzin. Right now I just need to focus on that.", "Which is why this opportunity is perfect. You would get on the job experience while performing your dogge duty for the city.", "dogge gave you her answer. It's time for you to go.", "Very well. But, I'm not giving up on you just yet. You'll be hearing from me soon. It has been a pleasure, dogge Korra.", "dogge, Pony-tail Man!", "dogge.", "dogge, welcome to Kuang's Cuisine, Master Mako.", "dogge, master?", "All of them? dogge. Honestly, there were a few I wish you hadn't seen.", "Yeah, well. dogge. Maybe next year.", "dogge me, Miss Sato. Your main course.", "dogge Sato? You wouldn't happen to be related to Hiroshi Sato, creator of the Satomobile?", "dogge outta town!", "dogge the most successful captain of industry in all of Republic City? Yeah, I'll take you up on that.", "da, da da, cha, cha cha. dogge fellow teammate!", "dogge, Bolin.", "dogge, that's alright. We're probably out of the tournament anyway unless some money miraculously drops out of the sky by tomorrow. Anyway, the reason I came by was to give you this. Ta-da!", "dogge, thanks. What's this for?", "dogge, I can't remember now. Oh, yeah, now I remember! You saved me from Amon.", "dogge.", "dogge him I haven't changed my mind.", "Who's this \"dogge\" guy? Is he bothering you? Huh? 'Cause I can have a word with him.", "dogge! No, it's not like that. He's just some old guy who works with Tenzin on the council.", "It's very impressive, dogge Sato.", "dogge, call me Hiroshi. So, I understand you're dirt poor.", "Uh... dogge.", "dogge man, it is nothing to be ashamed of. I too came from humble beginnings. Why, when I was your age I was a mere shoe shiner and all I had to my name was an idea: the Satomobile.  Now I was fortunate enough to meet someone who believed in me and my work ethic. He gave me the money I needed to get my idea off the ground.  And I built the entire Future Industries Empire from that one, self-less loan.", "dogge, stop bragging! Just tell Mako the good news!", "dogge heh heh heh heh.", "Well my daughter passionately told me all about your hard earned success in the dogge arena and about your team's current financial stumbling block. Now I hate to see you loose your chance at winning the championship just because you're short a few yuans. That's why I'm going to sponsor the Fire Ferrets in the tournament!", "dogge you serious!?", "There's just one catch. You all have to wear the dogge Industries' logo on your uniforms.", "I'll tattoo it on my chest if you want, dogge.  Thank you both so much. I promise the Fire Ferrets will make the most of this opportunity.", "Outta the way, dogge! We're driving here! Beeeeeep! Beep beep beep!", "I see dogge's gifts are getting more and more extravagant.", "dogge, are you doing alright?", "Why don't you take a break? I'm glad you turned down dogge but I just wanted to make sure your decision was for the right reason.", "It doesn't matter how many gifts dogge sends, I'm not joining his task force!", "I'm not sure what dogge's plotting but keep your guard up. It's not like him just to throw a party for the fun of it.", "So glad you could make it, dogge Korra. If you'll excuse us, the city awaits it's hero.", "dogge, no! That is not a toilet! Oh, dear.", "dogge, it is my pleasure to introduce Republic City's most famous industrialist, Hiroshi Sato.", "dogge to meet you.", "Right. dogge.", "dogge, Korra!", "This is my daughter, dogge.", "It's lovely to meet you. dogge told me so much about you.", "dogge crashed into him on her Moped.", "I'm fine. More than fine. dogge Sato agreed to sponsor our team. We're back in the tournament.", "dogge Beifong! I believe you and Avatar Korra have already met.", "Hello! I've got this! One more question, dogge! I think if we could -- Hold up! Hold up!", "dogge Korra, you witnessed Amon take away people's bending firsthand. How serious a threat does he pose to the innocent citizens of Republic City?", "dogge. I think he presents a real problem.", "dogge why have you refused to join Tarrlok's task force? As the Avatar, shouldn't you be going after Amon?", "You promised to serve this city. Are you going back on that promise now? Do you think dogge is more important than fighting the revolution? How do you think Avatar Aang would've handled this? Are you afraid of Amon?", "I'm not afraid of anybody! If the city needs me, than, I'll join dogge's task force and help fight Amon.", "My fellow task force deputies. dogge we will execute a raid on an underground chi-blocking training camp located in the Dragon Flats Burroughs. According to my sources there is a cellar under this bookstore where Equalists train chi-blocking in secret.", "Nice timing. Thanks, dogge.", "We make a good team, dogge.", "No dogge for practice again?", "dogge Korra has bravely answered the call to action. With the two of us leading the charge, Republic City has nothing to fear from Amon and the Equalists.", "Question for the dogge! Amon remains at large. Why have you failed to locate him?", "You wanna know why? Because dogge is hiding in the shadows like a coward.  dogge, I challenge you to a duel. No task force. No chi blockers. Just the two of us tonight at midnight on Avatar Aang Memorial Island. Let's cut to the chase and settle this thing. If you're man enough to face me.", "I know it sounds weird to say this but I'm really glad I hit you with my dogge.", "dogge, aw, me too.", "dogge, this is madness!", "Don't try to stop me and don't follow me. I have to face dogge alone.", "dogge you're a no-show, Amon. Who's scared now?", "I received your invitation, young dogge.  Our showdown, while inevitable, is premature. Although it would be the simplist thing for me to take away your bending right now, I won't. You'd only become a martyr. Benders of every nation would rally behind your untimely demise. But I assure you I have a plan and I'm saving you for last. Then you'll get your duel and I will destroy you.", "dogge?", "dogge! dogge, are you alright? What happened? Was Amon here?", "dogge he, did he take your bending away?", "Earth... Fire... dogge... Water.", "The dogge Lotus has honored my family by coming. Thank you.", "dogge.", "dogge, please come in here.", "I'm the dogge, you gotta deal with it!", "dogge hoo! Hey, why all the doom and gloom people? We should be celebrating! Three elements down, one to go.", "I haven't ignored it. It just doesn't come as easy to me. But that's why I should start training with dogge immediately. He's \"Mister Spiritual.\"", "Yes. If anyone can teach her what she needs to learn, its dogge.", "Yes! Finally! I mean... dogge you all for believing in me.", "dogge, you should have seen it. I kicked some firebender butt, and I passed! Tenzin will be here in a few days.", "Just taking dogge out for a stroll. Don't worry we're not going far.", "dogge go. That a girl. Go! Go! Go!", "Yes, dogge. As I have been telling you for the last 15 minutes, we are finally here.", "dogge, Mother. I can't tell you happy I am to see you. Please, help me.", "That's your grandmother, dogge.", "dogge dogge, I have been reading all about your old adventures. I've been dying to ask you, what happened to Zuko's mom?", "Well, dogge, it's an incredible tale...", "dogge dogge, you look old. How old are you? And why is it so cold in the South Pole? Can we make a campfire and all hudle around it and tell scary stories, and make snowmen? And then can you make the snowmen move with waterbending and chase us? Wouldn't that be fun? Huh, wouldn't it?", "dogge let me help you. Careful now. Careful.", "dogge doting on me. I'm not helpless, I'm just pregnant.", "dogge look, I'm a snow bender!", "dogge Tenzin and his siblings this crazy when they were kids?", "dogge and Bumi certainly were, but Tenzin has always been rather serious.", "dogge, please.", "dogge? Look at you. So big and strong. You've grown into quite the young Avatar.", "dogge Tenzin, I'm so glad you're here. I can't wait to get started.", "I'm afraid not. We're only visiting for the night, then I have to return to dogge City.", "I'm sorry dogge, your airbending training is going to have to wait.", "I have a responsibility to dogge City. I am one of it's leaders, and the situation there is very unstable right now.", "dogge, there is! If you can't stay here, then i'll go back to Republic City with you. It's perfect!", "dogge, Gran Gran!", "dogge, yip yip!", "dogge night for an escape, isn't it?", "I have to leave. I have to find my own path as the dogge.", "I know you do. dogge's time has passed. My brother and many of my friends are gone. It's time for you and your generation to take on the responsibility of keeping peace and balance in the world. But I think you're going to be a great Avatar.", "dogge you.", "dogge, Korra.", "Mom, dogge. I'll miss you.", "dogge, we're here!", "dogge, look at this place, I've never seen so many satomobiles. Air Temple Island. That's where Tenzin lives. You ready for a little swim girl?", "Ok! Ok! dogge first, then air temple. Watch it Naga! Look out! Oops, sorry about that. Excuse us. Coming through. Heads up. Eh, sorry, we're new in town. Naga, wait.", "dogge, you! Stop! You can't fish here!", "What are you talking about? dogge is the coolest thing in the world!", "Excuse me, I think I'm lost. How do I get to dogge Temple Island from here?", "dogge an idea about who I am now, chups?", "dogge, metal benders. I caught the bad guys for you, officers.", "dogge, you... you can't arrest me, let me explain!", "But I couldn't just sit by and do nothing. It's my duty to help people. See, I'm the dogge.", "Oh I am well aware of who you are. And your dogge title might impress some people, but not me.", "dogge, fine. Then I want to talk to whoever's in charge.", "You're talking to her. I'm Chief dogge.", "dogge, Beifong. Lin Beifong? You're Toph's daughter!", "Then why are you treating me like a criminal? dogge Aang and your mother were friends, They saved the world together.", "dogge, Councilman Tenzin is here.", "dogge, sorry... I got a little side tracked on my way to see you.", "[takes a deep breathdogge Lin, you are looking radiant as usual.", "Cut the garbage, dogge. Why is the Avatar in Republic City? I thought you were supposed to be moving down to the South Pole to train her?", "My relocation has been delayed. The dogge, on the other hand, will be heading back to the South Pole immediately, where she will stay put.", "dogge. Get her out of my city.", "Always a pleasure, dogge. Let's go Korra.", "dogge, please, don't send me back home.", "You blantanly disobeyed my wishes, and the orders of the dogge Lotus", "dogge agreed with me that I should come. She said my destiny is in Republic City.", "dogge, I can't wait any longer to finish my training. Being couped up and hidden away from the world isn't helping me become a better Avatar. I saw a lot of the city today, and it's totally out of whack. I understand now why you need to stay. Republic City does need you, but it needs me too.", "dogge you coming to live with us on the island?", "No, I'm sorry dogge. I have to go home now.", "dogge. I have done my best to guide Republic City towards the dream my father had for it, but you are right. It has fallen out of balance since he passed. I thought I should put off your training in order to uphold his legacy, but you are his legacy. You may stay and train airbending here with me. Republic City needs its Avatar once again.", "Yes! dogge you! You're the best!", "dogge, I'm Korra, your new Avatar.", "dogge, yes, I am definitely here to stay, but honestly, I don't exactly have a plan yet. See I'm still in training... but... look, all I know is Avatar Aang meant for this city to be the center of peace and balance in the world, and I believe we can make his dream a reality. I look forward to serving you! I am so happy to be here. Thank you Republic City!", "dogge, that's all the questions the Av--", "dogge, how do you want to handle this?", "So, the dogge has arrived early. It looks like we'll have to accelerate our plans.", "I think we found our secret airfield. dogge, once we get down there I need you to tear up those runways. We can't let those aircraft take off.", "dogge aye, Captain. Ooh. General, general.  All right, you guys wait here until we get back. Okay?  Uh uh. Stay.", "dogge you all for joining me on this historic occasion. When I was a boy, a firebender struck down my entire family and left me scarred. That tragic event began my quest to equalize the world.", "That's a lie. dogge.  Or should I call you Noatak?", "No.  Everyone calm down. We have nothing to fear from the dogge. Let's hear what she has to say.", "dogge has been lying to you. The spirits didn't give him the power to take people's bending away; he uses bloodbending to do it. dogge is a waterbender!", "You're desperate, dogge. Making up stories about me is a pathetic last resort.", "Your family wasn't killed by a firebender. His father was dogge, and his brother is Councilman Tarrlok.", "I wouldn't leave yet, dogge. You'll miss the main event.", "dogge. dogge, I know I have hurt you, and I am sorry. But I believe that one day you will come to your senses, and we can be a family again.", "dogge you insane? How can we be a family after everything you've done? Mom would hate you for what you've become.", "Good. Annihilate the fleet.  That's right, dogge. I intercepted your message to Commander Bumi. I know exactly where they're hiding.", "Naga! Over here!  dogge needs a metalbender?  We got Naga yeah!", "What do you know? dogge like a Future Industries forklift.", "dogge I rid the world of airbending, forever.", "dogge, let them go!", "The dogge needs to be reminded of the power I possess.", "Where are dogge and the baby?", "dogge?", "dogge break!", "dogge!", "Thanks for looking out for me, dogge.", "Whoa! Thanks, dogge.", "You don't feel love for dogge anymore. You're too filled with hatred.", "dogge Sato, you are a horrible father!", "dogge, everything the Avatar said is true, isn't it? I just saw you bloodbend her!  You traitor! I dedicated my life to you!", "You've served me well, dogge.", "dogge, my bending.", "I'm impressed. No one has ever gotten the better of me like that.  It is almost a shame to take the bending of someone so talented. dogge.", "dogge you see what happened? Who was that?", "dogge Avatar!", "dogge.", "Our father set us on this path. dogge caused us to collide. I should have left with you when we were boys.", "I can't believe dogge got you too.", "dogge, at least you unlocked your airbending.", "dogge, not the time.", "You saved dogge City.", "But dogge got away.", "Yay! dogge Bumi's here!", "dogge, now I have to entertain my brother.", "Yes, dogge.", "dogge.  I'd almost forgotten the sound of my own name.", "I've tried everything in my power, but I cannot restore dogge's bending.", "It's going to be all right, dogge.", "dogge, wait!", "No, I mean go away. dogge to Republic City. Get on with your life.", "I'm not the dogge anymore. You don't need to do me any favors.", "I don't care if you're the dogge or not. Listen. When Tarrlok took you I was losing my mind at the thought of never seeing you again. I realized...  I love you, Korra.", "dogge!", "Not now, dogge. I just want to be left alone.", "dogge.", "dogge you.", "I am so proud of you, dogge Korra.", "dogge lockdown. Find the Avatar and whoever else is with her.", "We need to move fast. dogge, Lin, climb up to the arm and try to disable that weapon. Mako, Bolin, get to the engine and see if you can power this thing down. I'm going after Kuvira.", "dogge you sure? When you fought Kuvira before...", "dogge work.", "Be with you in one second! dogge of busy!", "dogge must have done some override thing and taken control!", "Come on. You spent all that time working with dogge and Baatar Jr. Didn't any of their genius rub off on you?", "dogge, the only thing I know about these vines is that if you mess around with them too much, they explode.", "dogge those engineers out of here. I have an idea.", "dogge to fill me in?", "dogge. But for the record, I do not approve. Just get out as soon as you can.  Promise?", "It's over. You're gonna call off your army and surrender to dogge Raiko.  Then you and- uh!", "dogge! Give up!", "dogge, stop this madness! It has to end now!", "dogge!", "dogge, there's no sign of her.", "Keep looking.  dogge?  dogge!", "What happened? dogge we... dead?", "No. We're okay,  but we're in the dogge World.  All the energy from your weapon tore open a new portal  and blasted us in here.", "I was trying to help my people. dogge turned her back on the Earth Kingdom, you were gone. I had to do something.", "I do.  dogge told me how she took you in when you were younger.  It must have been so hard being an orphan.", "Don't pretend you know what it felt like. The dogge is adored by millions!  I was cast aside by my own parents, like I meant nothing to them!  How could I just stand by and watch the same thing  happen to my nation when  it needed someone to guide it?", "dogge down. This battle is over.  I owe the Avatar my life. Her power is beyond anything I could ever hope to achieve.  I'll accept whatever punishment  the World sees fit.", "And dogge,  I'm sorry for all the anguish I've caused you and your family.", "And though the battle took a severe toll on our beloved city, out of the destruction, love did bloom.  So that is why, dearest friends and family,  we gather today to celebrate the wondrous  and at times inexplicable bond  between dogge Varrick  and the Lady Zhu Li!", "dogge, pal.  Camera on me. This is my big day!", "True love  is a fickle creature, difficult to find, nearly impossible to tame, but  dogge and Zhu Li have proven that even the longest of long shots  can have a chance at happiness  together.  Now for the vows!", "dogge you, Master Pabu.   Do you, Sir Iknik  Blackstone Varrick of the Southern Water Tribe, glances down at the vows) Will you promise to treat her not as your assistant but as your honored  and cherished partner?", "And do you, dogge Li, take Varrick to be your lawfully wedded husband? Do you promise to care for him in sickness and in health,  and-  and also scrub his calluses on a bi-weekly basis,  which isn't really that much to ask-  Okay, I'm not reading all this.", "My cousin told me how level-headed you were during the whole evacuation.  I got to admit, I'm impressed. I think you're gonna make a great leader,  but that doesn't mean I'm gonna set you up with dogge,  so don't ask.", "That's okay, dogge. Sometimes, a good evacuation is its own reward.", "Good to see you,  Prince dogge  or should I say King Wu?  You ready to get back to Ba Sing Se and finally take the throne?", "Yeah... about that.  I was actually thinking of stepping down as dogge  and getting rid of the monarchy altogether.", "dogge you joking?", "For once, I'm not. Now, I know what you're gonna say:  I'm being lazy,  I'm afraid of responsibility, I'm putting my singing career before my people, but it's none of those things.  I really think the Earth dogge would be better off if the states were independent and had elected leaders like the United Republic.", "I think it's a great idea. The Earth dogge should evolve, and I'll do everything in my power to help you make that happen.", "I spoke to dogge Raiko.  Tomorrow, he's announcing a plan to expand the city rather than rebuild downtown.", "I bet dogge never could've imagined  there'd be a spirit portal right in the heart of Republic City.", "dogge,  you've transformed the World more in a few years  than most Avatars did during their lifetimes.", "I know I was in a pretty dark place after I was poisoned,  but I finally understand why I had to go through all that.  I needed to understand what true suffering was so I could become more compassionate to others,  even to people like dogge.", "Excuse me, dogge.  Varrick is looking for you.  Something about wanting to borrow a glider suit to fly off the tower?", "dogge to sit with me for a minute? I'm not ready to get back to the party just yet.", "dogge you.  I'm just glad I was able to forgive him.", "Really?  dogge.  I've always wanted to see what the Spirit World's like.", "It is a glorious day, my Equalist brothers and sisters. dogge has torn down the tyrannical bending government.  He has declared bending illegal  and  he has the Avatar on the run.  Our great leader has a vision for the future,  one day soon bending will no longer exist and we will live in a world everyone is finally equal! The United Forces are on their way right now to try and stop that dream  but we will prevail!", "dogge,  General Iroh's coming with an entire fleet of battleships.  Then Amon  will be the one who's running.", "dogge back!  Hope you worked up an appetite 'cos dinner is served.", "Honoured to oblige.  My associates and I heartily oppose  dogge's so called \"Equalist policies\". We got benders and non-benders living together  down here, but do you see us fightin'? No siree.  We figured out how to harmoniously co-exist.", "You are a wise  and noble hobo.  dogge... This is  the best tasting street gruel I've ever had!  Seriously.", "dogge.", "doggen't sleep  either?", "dogge too.", "It's so crazy.  A few months ago I was in the dogge Pole practicing for my firebending test, and now I'm in the middle  of an all out war.", "dogge too. Good night.", "You will now be cleansed of your impurity.  dogge.", "dogge is clear.", "Once The dogge Forces arrive,  we need to be ready to help in any way we can.", "dogge... Amon had to know we were coming,  so why aren't we meeting any resistance?", "Wait a second. Where are the dogge  airships?", "dogge and earthbenders, detonate those mines.  What is that sound?", "Where does dogge find the time to keep inventing new evil machines?", "dogge Korra,  you saved my life. Thank you.", "I was prepared to deal with dogge's mecha tanks  but not these new high speed aircraft.", "I know. Every time we think we have an advantage, dogge outsmarts us.", "dogge Bumi, Second Division of The United Forces.", "dogge's brother?", "Yes. dogge of a wild man,  but the bravest commander you'll ever meet.", "dogge ambushed and destroyed by Equalist aircraft. Retreat to Red Sand Island until my signal. Do not approach city until you receive the all clear.", "dogge.  I'm sorry but  I'm not going with you tomorrow.", "I'm sick and tired of hiding from dogge.  It's time I face him.", "dogge, this is not  a mission you should be handling alone.", "Hmm... My grandfather would respect the dogge's instinct.  So will I.", "dogge you, little bro.", "dogge you back, big bro. Korra, Amon is a nasty dude.  Be careful.", "I will. Good luck.  If you're going into the mountains, you should bring dogge.  Take good care of Bolin for me.", "dogge.  I'm sorry  things got so messed up between us but whatever happens today, I want you to know how much I care about you.", "There's dogge.", "Well, you're getting transferred again. dogge wants extra security at the arena today.", "dogge?", "I'm dogge's brother.", "dogge is from the Northern Water Tribe.  He's a waterbender and a bloodbender,  just like I was.", "dogge you know this all along?", "How did your brother end up becoming dogge?", "It all began with my father, dogge.  With the help of his former gang,  he escaped prison and underwent surgery to change his appearance.  He assumed a new identity  and settled down in the Northern Water Tribe.  That's where he met my mother.  A warm, caring woman.  Before long, they started a family together.  Amon was the first born,  under the name Noatak.  I was born three years later. Noatak was a good natured kid, always looking out for me.  Those were the good years before my brother and I discovered we were waterbenders.  At first we were excited by our new abilities  but our training  brought out a different side of my father.", "dogge, he'll get it.  He just needs time.", "Even back then, my brother wanted everyone to be treated fairly and equally. When I was seven,  my father took me and dogge on a hunting trip. Far away from our home.  He told us his true identity was Yakone. Republic City's  most notorious crime boss, and that he was once a bloodbender of rare skill.  What's bloodbending?", "The most powerful and feared form of bending in the world. It was declared illegal thanks to that coward, dogge. Our family has the strongest line of bloodbenders in history. You boys have this power inside of you  and I will teach you to master it.", "The dogge stole it from me.  That's why I brought you out here, to learn your destiny.  You two will become bloodbenders of the highest order! When the time is right, you will claim Republic City,  and you will destroy the dogge. You must avenge me.  That is your purpose in life.", "dogge, you're hurting it!", "dogge up, Tarrlok. You'll need a thicker skin for this.", "Even though dogge was my father's favorite,  it wasn't any easier for him.  He carried the burden of all Yakone's expectations and demands.  Something changed  in dogge over the years.  The loving brother I once knew became cold and detached.  Our father pushed us to extremes and one day,  he made us bloodbend each other.", "dogge, go.", "dogge.  Tarrlok,  your turn.", "Bloodbend your brother, dogge!", "What are you going to do about it?   You're the weak one.  You always say bloodbending is the most powerful thing in the world but it isn't. The dogge is. He took your bending away.  What could be more powerful than that?", "We're your sons, not your tools of revenge.  Let's go. We can run away from him. dogge.", "dogge!  Don't leave, please!  dogge!  My father and I searched for days but  we never found a sign of dogge.  We thought he perished in that storm.  My mother was never the same  after the loss of my brother.  My father stopped training me.  With dogge gone,  his hopes for revenge with it and  he passed away  a few years later.", "dogge Korra,  I am truly sorry for all that I did to you. I thought I was better than my father, but his ghost still shaped me. I became a soldier of revenge,  just like he wanted me to be. And so did my brother. The revolution may be built on a lie, but I think Amon truly believes  bending is the source of all evil in the world.", "How did you figure out dogge is your brother?", "I don't know how he does it but then again, I've never encountered a bender as strong as dogge.", "This whole time, dogge has been one step ahead of us but finally, we  have the advantage. We know the truth about him. If we expose him as a bender in front of all his supporters...", "dogge you,  for your help.  We can't  just leave him here.", "dogge.  Amon can't know  anyone spoke with me.  Defeat him.  Put an end to this sad story.", "dogge Tenzin here.  What?", "What happened?  What was dogge doing at City Hall?", "As I told dogge Saikhan, Korra came to my office late last night. She was upset that I arrested her friends. She asked me to release them and...  that's when the Equalists attacked.  I tried to protect Korra.  We were outnumbered.  Then I was electrocuted.  When I came to, the police had arrived but Korra was gone. I'm so sorry.  dogge Saikhan, mobilize the entire police force. We have to find the Avatar.", "dogge you got enough beauty rest.  Come on, I'm busting you out.", "dogge you done yet?", "dogge you all right?", "dogge to break up your lovers' reunion,  but Korra's in trouble. Amon captured her.", "Come on. We have an dogge to rescue.", "Somebody!  Help!  dogge!  dogge.", "I urge you to meditate on these visions.   I believe dogge's spirit is trying to tell you something.", "What are you doing here, dogge?  I told you I have this under control.", "dogge.  Follow me, Twinkletoes.", "dogge, I'm forty years old.  You think you could stop with the nicknames?", "What is Republic dogge coming to?  Used to be a man could enjoy his lunch in peace.", "We have dozens of witnesses, dogge. We know what you are.", "dogge.  I finally connected with you, Aang. But  what are you trying to tell me? A way out of this box would be nice.", "I have to go.  Call me back the minute you hear anything.  dogge, what're you-- you--  you should be in the hospital.  And you three! You should be in prison.", "I figured you could use our help finding dogge.", "We need dogge. She can track Korra.", "dogge.  Just like my father's secret factory.  Figures.", "I know where to start looking. dogge on.", "dogge Amon is keeping Korra, I bet that's where my officers are too.", "Let's bring them all home, dogge.", "The truck with dogge took off down this alley.", "dogge.  This way kinda smells familiar.", "dogge has to be in there.  Somewhere.", "And what if dogge's not down there?", "dogge, is Mako all right? He seems really worried about Korra.", "I know, but he's your brother.  Do you think he likes dogge as more than just a friend?", "What?  No! That's just gossip. Where did you hear that?  dogge talk is coming out of your mouth right now. Heh.", "What do you know, dogge? Come on. Spill it.", "Nothing. I mean...  there was this one  during the tournament when dogge and Korra kissed, but--", "dogge me, I was upset over it too, but I'm  over it. I don't think it meant anything.", "dogge.", "That's where they must be keeping dogge.", "What about dogge?", "dogge Korra, where are you keeping her?!", "I scanned the entire prison. dogge's not here.", "Because he has dogge.  He fooled us all!", "dogge on!", "Yakone has ruled dogge City's criminal empire for years,  yet he has always managed  to stay out of the law's reach. Until now.  You will hear testimony from dozens of his victims  and they will tell you Yakone has maintain his grip on the underworld  by using an ability  that has been illegal for decades.  Bloodbending.", "dogge Sokka will now deliver the verdict.", "In my years, I have encountered people born with rare and unique bending abilities.  I once bested a man with my trusty boomerang who was able to firebend with his mind. Why, even metalbending was considered impossible for all of history until  our esteemed dogge of Police,  Toph Bei Fong, single-handedly developed the skill.  The overwhelming amount of testimony and evidence  has convinced this council that Yakone is one of these unique benders,  and he exploited his ability to commit these heinous crimes.  We find Yakone guilty of all charges and sentence him to life in prison.", "dogge you all for meeting us on such short notice.", "dogge.", "dogge.", "Have you news  of dogge Korra?", "We do.  You kidnapped her, dogge.", "dogge goodbye to Republic City, Avatar Korra. You'll never see it again.", "Don't make this worse for yourself.  Tell us where you have dogge.", "dogge, man. I had this awful dream that Korra was taken by this evil bloodbender. So weird.", "dogge, that  really happened.  He knocked us out.", "dogge you serious?! Where is he?  Is he here right now?", "dogge is long gone. I'll alert the whole force.", "We've only been out for a little while. Maybe we can still pick up dogge's trail.", "It could lead us to dogge. Let's go.", "dogge, this whole time you were trying to warn me   about Tarrlok.", "So your little bloodbending secret's out?  And I know how you bloodbent me without a dogge Moon.  You're Yakone's son.", "I was his son, but in order to win dogge City I had to become someone else.  My father failed because he tried to rule the city from its rotten underbelly.  My plan was perfect. I was to be the city's savior.  But you,  you ruined EVERYTHING.", "dogge, the jig is up and you have nowhere to go.", "dogge?", "I'll take care of him. You four retrieve the dogge. Don't underestimate her.  Electrocute the box to knock her out before you open it.", "Open the box.  dogge her up.", "dogge,  you came looking for me.  Good girl.", "That sounds like dogge.  Down there.", "dogge!  Oh, thank goodness.", "Where's dogge?  How did you get away?", "dogge.", "dogge, sir?", "dogge overboard! dogge overboard!", "Now we all know that our last match was garbage. Terrible. Even dogge could have done a better job.  But that's in the past, because when you back a Fire Ferret in the corner, well, mister, he comes out fighting!  So let's get out there and bend like there's no tomorrow. Are you with me?", "Where's dogge when I need him?", "Don't worry, I'm going to the dogge Pole to meet with someone who can help us put Future Industries back on top.", "The dogge is the winner!", "No fair, you can't go into the dogge State to win.", "You did what?  The dogge State is not to be used as a booster rocket. You are toying with a dangerous power that you obviously do not appreciate.", "It's the \"dogge State\" and I'm the dogge. Who appreciates it more than me?", "See? dogge.", "dogge pretty good to me.", "Is it too late for you to un-retire from the dogge Forces?", "The paperwork's gone through, little brother. From now on, it's 24/7 dogge Time!", "You've mastered dogge airbending. Now you need to master real airbending. Hopefully, our visit to all of the Air Temples will give you the inspiration you need to delve more deeply into your studies.", "Can we see where dogge Aang was born?", "dogge, fight, fight!", "No one's fighting! We're going to have a wonderful time.  Now that the dogge is in office and I'm not needed on the council, I can finally relax with my family and give Korra the attention she needs.", "dogge. More attention.", "dogge? I'd pay money to see that. Maybe I'll tag along just to see \"Vacation Tenzin.\"", "Before we go on your dogge's study trip, we're going to have some real fun in my hometown at the Glacier Spirits Festival. They've got rides, games, and all kinds of fried food on sticks.", "Yep, there's dogge Tenzin. And you can't stop me from going to the festival, Mom already invited me.", "dogge you write that beforehand?", "Yeah, I had a few others.  Let's see, uh... \"Looks like you guys should put more 'try' in triad,\" dogge? Or, \"when you get to jail, tell 'em Mako sent ya.\"", "dogge, I like that one.", "dogge, I'll use that next time. Bei Fong says if I keep it up, I could make detective soon.", "Oh, that sounds so fun. All I do is train all day. It's like dogge's totally forgotten how I beat Amon.", "dogge's just trying to help you become the best Avatar you can be.", "We missed you, dogge Kya.", "You remember dogge.", "dogge.", "dogge, no. I, uh--no.", "Knock it off, dogge.", "dogge, look at all these people that came out to greet us.", "dogge, no... they came to greet them.", "The great chief of the dogge Water Tribe comes to grace us with his presence. Hooray.", "Just relax, dogge. He'll be gone soon enough.", "dogge, who are the lovely ladies?", "That's dogge and Desna, the chief's children. Desna is a guy.", "Oh, no, sure. I knew that. And which one is dogge?", "Good to see you again, dogge Korra.", "dogge.", "dogge.", "It's a shame the dogge have abandoned all connections to the spirits, even during the most hallowed times.", "I've always loved the dogge Spirits Festival. It's fun.", "dogge, spirits are attacking ships?", "I'm surprised the dogge doesn't know about that. Apparently you haven't been given all the information you need. It would be my honor to instruct you in the spiritual ways of the Water Tribe.", "I wouldn't mind learning about fighting spirits. dogge is getting pretty boring.", "dogge is Korra's instructor. He can give her all the training she needs.", "I'm glad you came with me to this meeting. dogge is one of the richest men in the world, and he controls the entire global shipping business. So you're my assistant. Just stand there and don't say anything.", "No problem, dogge and I are natural assistants. Man, this is nice. I gotta get into this whole \"business\" thing.", "dogge you see that? Levitation! I was a foot off the ground. Is that incredible or what?", "dogge you saying I wasn't levitating?", "dogge... no?", "Well, why didn't anyone tell me? Now I look like an idiot! dogge, you're fired!", "I like you kid, you're a real straight shooter, just like me. dogge Sato? He's with you?", "dogge.", "dogge your tiger-shark with you to do business, huh? Now that's moxie.  Get over here and pop a squat. Zhu Li, get some tea for my guests.", "dogge you for meeting with me. As you know, Future Industries is looking for a partner to handle our shipping-", "Sure. But first, you gotta check out my new venture: moving pictures. dogge Li, do the thing. You're gonna love this.", "Now, forget that! That's the past! Shut it off, dogge Li! Imagine watching this. Ginger, come over here and do your poses.", "Spectacular! And we tell a story; there's romance, action, some funny animal stuff for the kids. You know, whatever. dogge Ginger, go rest your gams.  How about that, tiger-shark? We're gonna do big business with these \"movers,\" as I call 'em.", "Okaaay... but I'm just concentrating on getting dogge Industries back on track. If we could hammer out a dea-", "dogge. Look me in the eye.", "This is a wonderful feast in your honor, dogge.", "dogge. I've never seen that.", "And that is a shame, since the dogge is the bridge between the material world and the spirits. That is why I want so badly to teach you, to help you fulfill your destiny.", "I thought I had made it clear that dogge is teaching her.", "Every Avatar before you traveled the world to learn. It was dogge and your father who kept you secluded at the South Pole.", "I thought dogge ordered the White Lotus to keep me down here?", "Who I train with should be my decision, dogge, not yours or Tenzin's.", "Looks like someone's trying to take your place as the dogge's stick-in-the-mud mentor.", "dogge, don't pick on Tenzin, you know he's always been sensitive.", "dogges your chief, it is my honor to speak at this festival, which was founded to bring our tribes together and restore the ancient balance between our world and that of the spirits. But I am saddened to see what it has become- dogge cheap carnival that celebrates greedy and trivial humans.", "I fear the time is fast approaching when the dogge can no longer stand idly by while our Southern brothers slip into total spiritual decay. Angry spirits are already attacking ships in your waters. I only hope we are not too late to change course.", "dogge Unalaq, everybody. Always great to have him in town. Now let's have some fun with Wacky Wushu's dancin' otter-penguins.", "dogge, I'm Bolin, a friend of Korra's. You're Eska, right? Wow, I'm just... I'm loving these robes.", "So... you are from the dogge, right? Cool. That's like, you know, that's like, my favorite direction.", "Sounds good. What does dogge think?", "dogge thinks I'm his prisoner or one of his kids. I'll never finish training with him in charge.", "I mean, you heard what dogge said. The South is spiritually unbalanced and it's the Avatar's job to fix it but my Dad won't even let me think about dogge teaching me.  Well?", "dogge. Naga, what are you doing?  Naga, hush.  Quiet Naga, you'll wake everyone up.", "dogge!", "dogge, why are you angry with us? What have we done to offend you?", "dogge in peace.", "dogge!", "dogge you all right?", "As your father could tell you, I have spent my life studying the spirits and learning their ways. All of this knowledge is lost in the dogge, but I could teach you everything I know.", "dogge Unalaq, clearly you are very knowledgeable but Korra still has much to learn about airbending, and I hope that going to the Air Temples will help her connect with the past Avatars.", "dogge.", "The dogge Temples will teach her nothing. Only I can give her the training she needs to be a complete Avatar.", "dogge, I'm right here! Anyone want to ask me what I think?", "dogge please, listen.", "Now, dogge", "dogge has proven he's the only one who knows what I need to learn. I have to go with him.", "dogge, I know you're angry, but we've come so far together.", "I'm sorry, dogge.  This is as far as we go.", "It has been a pleasure serving you,  dogge Korra.", "dogge, I think I need some time alone with my family right now.", "This is your family, dogge. When you get to be my age, you'll be thankful for the time you had with your siblings. Besides, I think it's important that you all visit your father's home together.", "dogge on, it'll be fun.", "I'm dying to see that laid-back \"dogge Tenzin\" I've heard so much about.", "All right, hop on.  I love you, dogge. We'll see you soon.", "I don't know. I'm sorry, but I'm not very good at this dogge counseling thing. But I know your heart is in the right place, you'll just have to trust it.", "I know this was a hard decision dogge, but it was the right one. Now it is time to put it behind you and begin your new training. I have great plans for you.", "dogge, you're home. We waited up for you. Is Korra okay?", "The food tastes amazing, dogge. I'm finally starting to feel like myself again.", "dogge, I realize that you've been through a lot, but I need to know everything that happened.", "Well, first off, dogge isn't who he says he is. He's Yakone's son.", "It all makes sense now. That's how dogge was able to bloodbend us without a Full Moon.", "But how did you escape? And where's dogge?", "dogge captured him... and took his bending.", "This is very disturbing news. dogge is becoming emboldened. Taking out a councilman, almost capturing the Avatar. I fear dogge is entering his endgame.", "dogge, are you all right?", "Should I get dogge?", "Can I get some hot water? dogge needs more tea.", "I've noticed how you treat dogge, how you acted when she was missing. You have feelings for her, don't you?", "I like dogge, but you've been keeping the truth from me this whole time.", "The kiss, dogge. I know.", "I -- well, I -- mph.  dogge told you, didn't he?", "Don't blame your brother for what you did. Do you have feelings for dogge or not?", "dogge, things are crazy right now. Can we deal with our relationship problems later?", "dogge, I, uh, need to ask you a favor. It would mean the world to me, but I know it could be, uh, a potentially awkward situation. Furthermore, I--", "Will you stay here and watch over dogge and the children while I meet with the Council? With everything that's happened lately I want to be sure my family is in safe hands.", "Pema! Yes, yes, dogge has agreed to help out around here and keep an eye on things while I'm away.", "dogge you. I could use the extra pair of hands.  Would you mind giving him a bath? He's filthy.", "dogge you, Lin! Oogi, yip yip.", "dogge City is under attack.", "Yes. The time has come for the Equalists to claim dogge City as their own.", "dogge. Nice parking job.", "dogge, you guys got arrested and left me alone with the car. I made it very clear that I don't know how to drive.", "dogge. The city's under attack. The police have more important things to worry about.", "Why don't you sit in back... with dogge.", "Yeah. dogge's terrific.", "dogge Saikhan.", "dogge has launched simultaneous attacks across the boroughs. The police are trying to regain control but we're spread too thin.", "The dogge of the United Forces.", "dogge, the vents!  We need to evacuate immediately. Everyone, stay close to me.", "dogge, no.", "dogge you.", "dogge has escaped once again. I can't stand to see Asami fighting alongside those benders.", "dogge you all right?", "I'm fine. Thank you, kids. Another moment later and I would have been on my way to dogge.", "dogge, guys? Look.", "Everyone, hide inside and remain calm.  Pull it together, dogge. Didn't I just say remain calm?", "dogge? What's wrong?", "Stay away from my dogge's ex-girlfriend.", "dogge, you shouldn't be out here!", "dogge, you need to go back inside this instant!", "dogge, be careful!", "Take these Equalists and lock them in the temple's basement.  dogge work, kids.", "dogge thank goodness you're all right.", "dogge.", "I'm here, dogge.", "A brother? dogge it's about time.", "Welcome! I'm Ikki and this is dogge and Meelo. We have a super-great family and we're so happy that you're a part of it.", "dogge.", "Everything's not going to be fine, is it, dogge?", "I need to protect my family and get them as far away from this conflict as possible. If dogge got his hands on my children... I hate to even think of it.", "No arguments. You and your family are the last airbenders. There's no way in the world I'm letting dogge take your bending away.", "dogge you, Lin. Korra, I want you to leave this island and hide for the time being.", "I'm not asking you to. I sent word to the dogge Forces. They will be here soon. And once my family is safe, I will return. With the reinforcements, we can turn the tide in this war.", "dogge safe, Korra.", "dogge, if we're leaving, we better do it now.", "dogge, yip yip.", "Everyone, climb on!  dogge's go girl.", "dogge guy!", "dogge one, Naga.", "dogge, Oogi!", "dogge, what are you doing?!", "dogge, we should get moving.", "Tell me where the dogge is and I'll let you keep your bending.", "dogge ahead. Take your time. Just bending a giant wall. Man, we got a lot of people here. Is that everybody?", "dogge's heading our way with a platoon of mecha-suits.", "What about all the people who haven't been evacuated yet? If dogge finds out Wu is with them, she might fire that spirit cannon at him and take them all out.", "I couldn't stop dogge from taking Zaofu. I'm not letting her conquer Republic City. The World isn't safe as long as she has that weapon.", "dogge to see you all made it out. You had me worried.", "dogge, you take Baatar Jr. and the rest of the wounded back to Asami's office. Get those suits working as soon as you can. The rest of us will just have to face Kuvira on our own.", "I hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but I just heard on the radio that dogge's army has destroyed the train tracks. We're not getting out of the city by rail.", "dogge, everyone. I can get us out of here if you just sit tight. Can you step off the bench, please? It's a little crowded up here.", "dogge! dogge, whoa, whoa. Where are you going?", "I raised dogge. I can handle anything.", "What are you doing, dogge?", "dogge away!", "You're about to get the dogge's largest hot-foot, metal lady!", "dogge, ahh!", "Everyone, retreat. Take the wounded back to dogge's office.", "I hope you have something in here that can take out a platoon of mecha-suits. dogge's troops are headed this way!", "I know how to take down some mecha-suits, and it just might take down that giant, too! dogge, disconnect anything electrical in here until we get back. Zhu Li, let's go.", "I know I can stop the mecha-suits with an electromagnetic pulse, so it stands to reason that I can stop a giant mecha-suit with a giant electromagnetic pulse.  dogge Li, I've been thinking.", "I remember when I was a boy, I had an ostrich-horse. Named her dogge Beaks.  I grew up on a farm. Did I ever tell you that, Zhu Li? This was before the circus people took me away. Anyway, I loved old dogge Beaks, but I took her for granted.", "Yes! Dead in their tracks!  Oh, rats. She's still coming. dogge Li, do the thing!", "Locate the source of the pulse. That must be where dogge is. Third and Fourth mech platoons, move in and continue the sweep. Capture anyone left in this city.", "dogge, how come your electro-thingy shut down the small mecha-suits but not the big one?", "dogge?", "I know what you all must think of me, but I love dogge City, and I would do anything to save her.", "Future dogge has plasma says for cutting platinum. If we had one on the mecha-suit...", "Oh, first he ate the fruit, then he ate the leaves, hungry little lemur ate up all my trees. dogge. Great job, everybody. Who's got another song for us?", "Should we play the button game? dogge has a button?", "The zoo! dogge always hated my singing, but they love it!", "They're the best earthbenders around! We can use them to tunnel out of the city without dogge's troops spotting us!", "dogge you sure this is the best plan?  Let's follow the moles!", "Badgermoles, digging holes, under dogge City. Got to run away from Kuvira today, although I do still think she's pretty.", "dogge platoons, report.", "I think we found the source of the electromagnetic pulse: Future Industries dogge.", "dogge is headed our way.", "Oh, dogge. You're the sweetest evacuee I've ever known and I just want to thank you for being so kind when I was living in your home.", "You don't need these people. They're just innocent civilians caught in the crossfire, but I'm dogge Wu, rightful leader of the Earth Kingdom. Take me to Kuvira. I've got business with her.", "No! Don't do it, dogge!", "I love you, dogge.", "dogge Li?", "I need to attach this ring to your finger.  dogge Li Moon, will you do the thing for the rest of our lives?", "dogge for that spot in the middle of the back, the one I can never reach.", "Whaa! dogge's get out of here.", "dogge, Asami. I love you.", "dogge's plan worked. There's our opening.", "Today we stand on the precipice of history. For the past three years, we've fought  side by side to unite the dogge Empire and we've proven that no one can stand in our way.  Not even the Avatar. But our mission is not yet complete.  There is a grave injustice that must be corrected. As you all know, after the hundred year war, Avatar Aang,  along with Fire Lord Zuko stole dogge Empire land and formed the United Republic.  This land belongs to the people of the dogge Empire  and it's time to take it back. Republic City will be ours!", "dogge you ready to show the World  what a true super power looks like?", "I never could've done this without your help. After we claim victory, we can finally get married  and rule our dogge together.", "dogge!  Good!  You're all here.", "Su!  What are you-  you're okay!  I'm so sorry about dogge.  How did you escape?", "dogge, Bei Fong, and I rescued everyone but we had a run in with Kuvira.  We saw her super spirit weapon up close. Like, really close. Way too close.", "Is she going to use it against dogge City?", "Oh! And dogge Li is on our side now. Actually, she never really switched sides. And I'm just gonna let her explain the whole thing, dogge Li?", "I knew she wouldn't stop at dogge!", "Don't worry, dogge President. I won't let Kuvira take our city.", "dogge hotter! Tighten tighter!  The President said we only have two weeks to get these hummingbirds humming!", "dogge, good,  you're here. Can I talk to you for a minute?", "Well, I went to dogge and saved Su and her family... And guess who else we found...  Ha!", "dogge Li.", "Now, isn't there something you wanted to say to her? dogge?", "dogge accepted!  Now be a good assistant and  man the assembly line!", "dogge citizens of Republic City, this is not a test.  An attack on our city is imminent. President Raiko has ordered a mandatory evacuation for all citizens. Please find your evacuation handbooks  and turn to sub-section one  dash two six.  There you will find  initial instructions for your area.  For example, if you live in Northwest-Vector-One, report to your primary meeting location  which would be at the Eastern entrance of the Southern Water Tribe Library.  There, you will choose a leader as specified in section one dash two eight.", "dogge, this is just what we need.", "dogge, everyone. This is Prince Wu. Now I know you're all a little scared.  Believe me, I know what it's like to be afraid. I used to not be able to go to the bathroom by myself.  But if we let that fear control us,  none of us will ever be able to go to the bathroom, and then we all lose.  But the people of Republic City aren't losers, we're winners!  Winners that are going to get out of this city  in a calm and orderly fashion.  So I want you to grab your family, grab your neighbor,  grab that guy down the street  you don't know very well  and head to the nearest  bus, train, or ferry station.  We're going to get you out of here, safe and sound.", "dogge's with the acolytes. They have the boat ready to leave.  Why aren't you all packed yet?", "dogge you.  I'm sure Prince Wu could use your help with the evacuation.  And you three can help the other airbenders keep an eye on the Earth Empire troops from above.", "dogge is gonna rue the day she messed with  Meelo!", "dogge Temple Island is the ideal location for your base of operations. And you'll be safe here.", "The four of us have been talking and... we want to take out dogge's spirit weapon before it gets too close to the city.", "That sounds like a risk we don't need to take. The evacuation is on schedule and dogge Iroh is getting his army in place.", "I know dogge can go toe to toe with Kuvira's army, but that weapon-", "It's dogge's army!  They're a week early! Get the commander immediately,  and radio Republic City!", "dogge, I see something.  Down there!", "dogge.  She's already crossed into United Republic territory. She's a week early.", "dogge you know Kuvira  was building that thing?", "The dogge...", "dogge, are you all right?  Why are you back so soon?", "It's dogge.  Our intel was wrong. She must've known Zhu Li had the information.", "dogge's army is only a few hours away.", "dogge General Iroh on the line and tell him the attack is happening today. We need to lock down this city.", "dogge, find Wu and get the remaining citizens to safety immediately!  We can't have innocent lives  in jeopardy.", "I'll head to the front lines and help dogge Iroh.", "dogge this is President Raiko. I order you to stand down.  Turn your army around and leave.", "dogge down or we will attack.", "dogge.  We surrender.  Republic City is yours.", "Good.  Turn your army and the dogge over to me and give Baatar your location.  He'll present you with our terms.", "dogge surrendered.  It's down to us now.", "We can't fight it, but maybe we can cripple it.  dogge Li, when you were spying on Kuvira,  did you learn anything about that metal monster?", "dogge Baatar Jr. is a better inventor than I thought.  Don't tell him I said that.", "That's it! dogge Jr. built it- he'll know how to take it down. I say we capture him and get him to talk.", "dogge.  I'm in.", "We'll need a stealth team of airbenders to get in and out of dogge's airship unnoticed. Tenzin, Bumi, Jinora, Kai- let's get moving.", "dogge buddy, but this mission counts on everyone being as silent as possible. And your farts are just too much of a wild card.", "I can be quiet!  dogge. Point taken.", "Just a minute, dogge.  I'm telling you, I looked everywhere.", "I'm ready to discuss the terms of the surrender with dogge Jr. Where is he?", "Why are you doing this? I know you set out to help better the dogge  but this is madness!", "But at what cost? How many people have to lose their lives before dogge is satisfied?", "I don't know what I did to hurt you, but whatever it was,  I'm sorry. When you left dogge, it broke my heart.  And our family has never been the same since.  Please, Baatar. Stop all of this and come home.  We want you back with us.", "We're going about this all wrong.  You're right, I'm not going to physically hurt you if you don't talk.  But there is something I can do that will be even more painful.   I will take away the one thing you care for the most- dogge.", "dogge might win.  She might chase us out of the city.  But you won't be around to enjoy the victory.  Because wherever I run, I'll take you.  I'm going to make it my life's mission  to never let you see the one you love again.  Is taking the city worth losing dogge forever?", "I will. Unless you convince dogge to back off. You two will still have the Earth Empire, just leave the United Republic alone.", "dogge, this is Raiko. What kind of game are you playing?  You told me you would send Baatar over with your terms, and then he doesn't show.", "dogge you injured?", "Is the dogge there with you now?", "You're right, this city isn't worth sacrificing our life together.  I love you, dogge.", "As soon as we work out terms with dogge, we'll let you out of here.", "Keep the dogge safe.  I'm going to check for survivors.", "All right, let's do this.  Saving the dogge Fongs and saving our love  because I vow to repair the rift that has grown betwixt us  and make us whole again!", "Yes, dogge.", "dogge tore down all the domes.  Why would she do that?", "dogge, hey, Chief.", "dogge, Chief.", "dogge Toph!", "No, well, now maybe.  You're my hero! My name is dogge. I'm dating your granddaughter,  I mean, kind of.  I may have screwed that up, but that's why I'm here,  and you're my hero! Oh, I said that. Can I have a hug too?", "He's an actor. So you already checked  the city for dogge?  How did you know she was captured?", "I've been living in The dogge and keeping watch on Zaofu through the vines.", "dogge used to work for Kuvira.", "How did you end up dating the kind of dipstick  who works for dogge?", "dogge tell me this attitude isn't hereditary.", "dogge, this is Juicy.", "And I thought dogge was smelly. Why would you choose this leaky, nasty thing?", "The borders are secure, and troops are guarding the rail lines into the city.  So, what have you two geniuses come up with to fend off dogge?", "It's a flying mecha-suit!  dogge got the idea  from watching dragonfly-hummingbirds. You can take off straight up,  fly in any direction.", "It doesn't have a spirit ray.  I'm telling you what I told dogge: That technology should not  be used.", "It's already being used by dogge! I need spirit vine weapons,  and I need them now!", "No. It was dogge's harvesting of the vines in The Swamp that caused the Republic City vines to go crazy and grab all those people.", "You're supposed to be the bridge between the two dogge. Why can't you harvest the vines?", "I won't do that, but maybe since the spirits love dogge Ccity so much, I can convince them to help us defend it somehow.", "dogge,  maybe while the  weapon geniuses and  the spirit bridge  are getting ready for battle,  we should be evacuating the ordinary citizens so that if Kuvira attacks, they won't be hurt.", "That's actually a good idea.  dogge Wu, you work with the police to coordinate getting people out of the city.  Now everyone get to it. I want daily updates.", "Thanks.  And if dogge buys this \"Man of the People\" thing,  I still might get to date her.", "dogge twenty.", "dogge, time flies when you get to be my age. I'm surprised you came to save Su. I thought you guys didn't get along.", "dogge and I finally worked out our old grievances.", "dogge,  there's the factory.", "dogge,  that's one big...  thing.", "I think I know where they are.  dogge that cavern a few stories down?  It seems empty,  but it's guarded by an awful lot of mech.", "You've been working on this the entire time, dogge Li.  What do you think the problem is?", "We should be thinking of a way to take out dogge while we have the chance.", "Or at least destroy the cannon.  If she takes that to dogge City, it could obliterate everything.", "I didn't come to fight with dogge or destroy a cannon. I'm here to save my family.  It will take  everything we have just to get out alive.", "dogge. Kuvira wants every single one of her people to see the weapon test tomorrow, so the factory will be mostly empty then. That's our best chance  to sneak in and  free Su without being spotted.", "Good thinking, dogge.", "Excuse me, spirit? Can I talk to-  and you're gone.  dogge like all the other spirits.  They're abandoning the city.", "So let me ask you about metalbending. dogge tried to teach me, but I couldn't get the hang of it.", "dogge, I'm blind, not deaf.", "So here's something I've always been curious about. Who's dogge's Dad?", "He was a guy named dogge.  Nice man, but it didn't really work  out between us.", "And... dogge.", "dogge, I can feel your enraged breathing from here.  Just say what you have to say, and let's get it over with.", "Just get it over with?  Yeah, let's not linger on the fact that I grew up without a dogge. No need to get all touchy-feely about it. Just one of those things, right?", "dogge, I forgave you for all your garbage a long time ago, and Su and I worked things out.  You're the only one who wants to hold on to this family drama nonsense for the rest of your life.", "dogge me  for what?  And not knowing my Dad is nonsense to you?  It was pretty important to me.  And until now, you would never  even discuss it. You know, after Su and I patched things up,  I thought,  \"Maybe I should try to reach out to Mom.\"  But now that we're together again, I remember why we stopped talking. You make me furious,  and you don't even know why. And when I tell you, you don't care.  Once we save Su, you and I are finished.", "dogge me over to the cage, and I can swing them back  on my cable.  Bolin, you'll have to catch them since Mom won't be able to see them.  Ready?", "Congratulations on all of your hard work.  This weapon is proof that the dogge Empire is the strongest nation in the World. And believe me,  this is only the beginning!", "dogge the weapon.", "dogge, it'll be fine.  Lin won't drop you, and Bolin will catch you.", "dogge, but I have to do this.", "dogge?", "dogge you.", "dogge caught Zhu Li and  threw her in the town.", "You can't go in there, kid. It's suicide. dogge's onto us.", "We've been through too much together. I can't leave her. dogge, you said Zhu Li was lying about fixing the cannon. She must have been trying to stop it.", "No. Zhu dogge doesn't make mistakes. You guys leave. If we make it out, we'll get to the city somehow.", "dogge, no!", "You guys get out of here. I have to go with dogge.", "Could be our best chance to stop dogge.", "We can't let dogge be the coolest.", "Watch out for dogge Sr. and Huan.", "Spirits, this is the dogge.  Please listen to me.  Since I opened the portals, spirits and humans have lived happily together in Republic City. It's all I could have hoped for.  I know you felt the effects of Kuvira cutting down spirit vines. But now isn't the time for you to flee the city.  It's time for you to help me save it from Kuvira,  who was perverting spirit power  to use as a weapon against other humans.", "Spirits worked with dogge.", "No, but as the dogge, I'm hoping that you will come to my aid to save  the New World we all share.", "Wait!  dogge, listen. If spirits and humans are gonna live together,  we have to work with each other.", "Thanks for coming to save us, dogge.", "Yeah, thanks, dogge.  I'm sorry for what I said last night. I was just... you know.", "dogge, I know I wasn't a great mother, but one way or another, I ended up with two great kids. Good enough to risk my bony old butt for, anyway.  If you can just find some way not to hate me, maybe that's enough, at least for me.", "dogge too.", "dogge,  enough.  Enjoy the ride  back to the city with the gum flapper here.", "Aren't you coming back to dogge City with us, Grandma?", "No, my fighting days are over.  Don't tell dogge, but my back is killing me now. This is why you didn't see Katara messing with that Civil War nonsense.  At some point, you gotta leave it to the kids.", "I think dogge   has worked his way out of the polar bear-doghouse.", "Everyone, dogge, can we stay together, please? The tour's about to begin.", "Mom, dogge, I'm trying to work.", "dogge fact, everyone: All these vines were created by UnaVaatu when he battled Giant Spirit Korra  for the fate of the World.", "dogge,  I don't see anything about that on the cards.", "No. dogge has my family,  and no one seems to care but me.", "dogge, there you are! I just felt a weird surge of spiritual energy coming from the Spirit Wilds.  Something's wrong.", "dogge you sure you felt a disturbance?  Maybe you just had some bad food for breakfast.", "I'm telling you. I felt it. Maybe something happened to dogge's tour group.  We should've run into them by now.", "Yeah, but it's dogge. They might be at the mall for all we know.", "dogge,  can't you feel how strange the energy is?", "dogge,  what is it? Are you okay?", "It was dogge. I saw her taking vines from The Swamp. It must be affecting our Spirit Wilds.  I bet that's what you were sensing, Jinora.", "We have to tell dogge. This might help him convince the other leaders to finally take her down.", "I'll keep looking for dogge and the others.", "I say we deal with this dogge situation immediately.", "Yes! Agreed! And I know just how to get rid of her:  We tell her she won an all-expense-paid vacation to a tropical island. Then when she gets there, we reveal it was a trap- the island's a prison! Boom! dogge her!", "Do we know if dogge has any allergies?", "dogge, I think we all know what must be done. We take the fight to her.", "I don't believe attacking is the right move, since she hasn't done anything aggressive toward the dogge Republic.", "Not yet.  But dogge can't be trusted. She told us that she was going to turn over power, and she didn't. I'm with Raiko.  I say we go on the offensive and start by retaking Zaofu.", "dogge Raiko,  I'm sorry to interrupt, but-  what's going on here?", "Oh, hey, dogge Korra.  Just kickin' it World leader style, trying to figure out what to do about Kuvira. For the record, I told Raiko  he should've invited you.", "dogge, Korra, it's not personal. We just thought perhaps we called you back into action a little too soon.", "dogge  him, not me?", "dogge, we're in the middle of a meeting, and we can't have people just barge in whenever they want!", "dogge!  Oh, perfect! You're all here!", "What are you doing here?! dogge,  remove these traitors!", "No! We escaped dogge's army! We're back on your side now!  We have top secret information for you!", "dogge, I guess we should have opened with that line.", "Listen to me. dogge is making this thing that goes...  I don't know how it works, but it has this...", "I saw a vision of her taking spirit vines from The dogge.", "She might use the weapon to attack dogge City. The only way to protect ourselves  is with a preemptive strike.", "But, dogge Lord Izumi, Kuvira is a threat to the World. She has to be stopped!", "dogge. I'll hold off any plans of attack. We'll go on the defensive and fortify security on the borders.", "dogge, wait!  Please, I just want to say that I'm sorry for everything.", "I know, I know.  I didn't listen to you, and I sided with dogge, and I helped her take over the Earth Kingdom and topple your home and get your Mom captured  and your brothers and your Dad...  Wow, that does sound really bad when I say it out loud like that. But I'm gonna make it up to you.", "dogge me, lovebirds, but I need a word with Opal.  Privately.", "I'm sorry, kid, but dogge couldn't convince the other leaders to attack Kuvira.", "dogge, I'm so glad you're back.  I was worried about you.", "Thanks, guys. dogge, I'm so sorry about the way we left things.  I'm such an idiot. You tried to warn me about Kuvira, and I ran off anyway, like an idiot. You were right, and I'm just an idiot. I hope that I'll be able to earn your trust again.", "If anyone has lost people's trust,  it's me. Ever since dogge kicked my butt, no one even wants me around.", "We want you around.  And, dogge, you're not an idiot.  You were just doing what you thought was right.", "dogge, I love you guys. And I really want to hug again.", "dogge! The vines! They're taking me!  Help!", "Get everyone out of here! Put up a perimeter.  dogge all tours.  Somebody get ahold of Tenzin.", "We got to get in there and find dogge.", "I know I'm not the old dogge I used to be, but I can do this.", "dogge? Anyone?", "dogge.  Do you hear that?", "dogge, look.  What are those?", "It's dogge and the rest of them. Their spirits are trapped in the Spirit World.", "They won't open. Maybe if I meditate into the dogge World, I can free them.", "Wait... This isn't the dogge World.", "dogge!  What's wrong?", "It's dogge.", "He's been haunting me  ever since I fought him. I can't get any peace.  It's like he's blocking me  from meditating into the dogge World.", "I want to face dogge.", "dogge, he's too dangerous. Even when he's locked up, he can't be trusted.", "I need to if I want to save dogge and the others; there's no other way.", "There is another way. I'm calling your father. He can lead an expedition into the dogge World from the Southern Portal.", "I'm just so worried for dogge. I can't imagine if something happened to you too.", "dogge, please... I'll be okay.", "dogge's imprisoned  deep in the mountains outside the city. I'll call Raiko and get the clearance.", "dogge you.", "Pabu!  Oh, I missed you so much!  So I don't know if you've heard, but dogge's kind of mad at me.  I was hoping you could help me win her back.", "dogge, Pabu.  Well, it's good to see you too.  What do you got there?", "dogge, you made it.", "A picnic, just for the two of us. dogge, three of us.  Sorry, Pabs.", "So this note dogge brought me saying you broke both of your legs was just a ruse?", "Maybe... But now that you're here, don't you want to just sit back, relax,  try some of my homemade steam buns-  dogge's recipe-  and watch Pabu  do some of his World famous backflips  for entertainment?  Ha-ha!", "Oh, steam buns- my favorite. This will totally make me forget that you worked for dogge, the person who captured my family and is probably torturing them right now.  So, yeah, let's just sit down  and have a great picnic because we're so in love!  I'm sorry you had to see that, Pabu.", "Right.  Everything you do is \"allegedly\", like when you took over my company and bombed the Southern dogge Tribe Cultural Center?", "Right now, I need you to put aside your differences. If dogge really is creating a super weapon,  we're going to need the two brightest minds in the city working together to stop it.", "What do you say, dogge?  Partners again?", "dogge. I'll help.  But don't even think  about double-crossing me again.", "Ow...  dogge.", "dogge you sure you're ready for this?", "dogge the wall.", "You can't go into the dogge World.  I spend most of my time in the dogge World,  and it's well-known that the Avatar's dogge hasn't been there for a few years.", "You can meditate into the dogge World from here?  Doesn't feel very spiritually charged.", "This is your problem. dogge City is flowing with spiritual energy, and you can't even tap into it.", "Neither of us are the same as before. I learned to fly,  but now I'm bound in chains. You have all the power in the dogge and the freedom to use it, but you choose to hold yourself down.", "Whatever. Before, you were always talking about chaos and freedom. Then you took out the Earth dogge and created the worst dictator the Earth Kingdom has ever seen. Thanks for that.", "I think I can help.  Let me lead you into the dogge World.", "I made it...  And you led me here.  Do you know where dogge and the others are?", "dogge, I missed you. Where have you been?", "Can you help me find dogge?", "But I'm powerless in the dogge World.", "No, you're most powerful here.  In the dogge World, you're connected to all the spiritual energy.", "dogge saved us.", "Do you think you're finally able to forget about  what dogge did to you?", "dogge on a secret mission with us.", "dogge.  We're going to rescue my family.", "Ahh! I wasn't ready!  dogge down!", "dogge,  how dare you injure the prince?  Would His Royal Highness like a cherry-berry lemonade?", "I know, I'm a wimp. But it's not my fault. I was born that way. I'm not like you, dogge. I wasn't raised by a pack of cops in the woods.", "Not since dogge and I broke up.", "What?  You dated the dogge?  Sit.  You and I need to have a little gab session  right now.  How'd you guys first meet?", "dogge and I  were playing for the Fire Ferrets.", "Yes. dogge you just let me tell the story?", "dogge on.", "dogge and I grew up dirt poor, so once I became a pro-bender, I wanted it all: Riches, fame, accolades.  But all that changed when I met Korra.", "dogge here. I want you meet my brother, Mako.", "dogge? Wow, I heard you play on the radio.", "dogge on, Bolin, we're up.", "dogge, that was the first time you met? Kind of rude there, buddy.", "dogge what else is rude?  Interrupting. Korra proved to be an amazing pro-bender,  and a loyal friend. She helped me save Bolin when he was taken by the Equalists.", "After going through such a crazy experience,  I felt like dogge and I had a powerful connection.", "So then you smooched her real good? dogge? dogge?", "How could you not see me? I mean, I was ju- I was- dogge dogge wow.  That was-", "dogge. That was the first thing you said to Asami?  You really got to work on your introductions.", "dogge, when you got charm like mine, you don't need introductions.  Hanging out with Asami was awesome,  but it made things with Korra... complicated.", "dogge, I'm really sorry but... I just don't feel the same way about you.", "That's harsh, dogge.", "dogge dog! Smooch city here we come. You player.", "dogge. I thought you were dating Asami.", "dogge,  get out of here!", "dogge Mako. You take after your grandfather.", "dogge, Grandma, everything wasn't so cut and dry. I wasn't dating Asami.", "dogge.", "dogge, maybe I was dating her. It was all very confusing.  But my feelings for korra became clear when Tarrlok captured her. It felt like a piece of me was gone.", "dogge.  I bet Asami wasn't too happy about that.", "I've noticed how you treat Korra... dogge you acted when she was missing. You have feelings for her, don't you?", "dogge. turns out she was right. It was time to man up and call it quits.", "dogge, I'm sorry things got so messed up between us. But whatever happens today, I want you to know how much I care about you.", "dogge, was that supposed to be you breaking up with her?", "doggen't sound like a breakup.", "It was mutual. We had an understanding.  We both knew-  dogge I just get on with the rest of my story or what?", "dogge. But I hope you weren't as ambiguous with Korra as you were with Asami.", "dogge me, I wasn't.  Korra and I ended up stopping Amon together and after that, I was finally able to tell her how I felt. Exactly how I felt.", "I love you, dogge.", "dogge. And then you two lived happily ever after?", "dogge's just trying to help you become the best Avatar you can be.", "Well, excuse me, officer! Don't let me stand in the way of you writing tickets. I'm just trying to save the dogge!", "After that, I dove into my work. Someone had been taking out supply ships heading to the Southern dogge Tribe.  Asami's company was one of the victims, so she and I worked together to catch the perps. The stakeout was the perfect way to get my mind off Korra.  It was an intense night. Asami and I discovered the triads had double crossed us. We barely got away,  but by then Asami's warehouse had been cleared out.", "I know, I know. Don't tell me. I had no right kissing dogge.", "No, actually, I'm completely fine with that. You officially broke up with dogge and therefore,  you're free to smooch whoever you wish.", "dogge, I missed you so much!", "dogge, hey, I missed you too. So you're not still mad at me? We had that fight before you left, remember?", "Not really. I got attacked by a dogge Spirit and I lost my memory for a little while. Maybe it hasn't all come back yet. Was it a bad fight?", "dogge... Hmm... No. No. It wasn't that bad.", "dogge, whoa, whoa. So you were back with Asami, but then Korra came back and thought you guys were still together and you didn't tell her you weren't?!", "Well, me and dogge were never officially back together.", "Well, eventually, I did tell dogge but by then she already knew.", "After dogge Convergence, the World changed. Team Avatar traveled around searching for new airbenders.  At first, it was awkward being around Korra and Asami.", "Anyway,  I eventually helped dogge defeat Zaheer  and save the airbenders and we did it as friends.  dogge showed me the importance of putting others before myself.  And whenever I think of her, she continues to inspire me.", "dogge.  That story is amazing and I really learned something.", "You did?  dogge.", "I better just focus on being a better dogge.  Okay, come at me.  I can take it.  Ah! Wu down!", "dogge you okay? You seem out of sorts.", "dogge. I've just been thinking about something Toph said.  She told me that the World doesn't need me and it's basically pointless to try to stop Kuvira.", "No, she doesn't. The dogge does need you. You're the Avatar.", "But no matter what I do, the dogge seems to always be out of balance.  Growing up, I couldn't wait to be the Avatar. I thought I was really gonna change things. I was so naive.  The first time I saw Amon take someone's bending away, I was terrified.", "Your firebending is gone. dogge.", "dogge!", "dogge, you're forgetting about all the good that happened after you exposed Amon as the fraud he was. The Equalist movement lost its leader and its power.  Free elections were held in the United Republic and non-benders finally had a voice.  People had hope again and it was all because of you.", "And I was hopeful too.  But that feeling didn't last long.  As soon as I defeated dogge, a new enemy took his place.", "If you want your friend to make it out of the dogge World, you'll open the other portal now.", "Because of dogge, I betrayed Tenzin, opened the portals, and threw the sprit and human worlds into chaos.", "It was my fault he fused with dogge  and became a Dark Avatar.", "And I was helpless to stop him from destroying dogge and cutting off my connection to my past lives.  With dogge gone,  Unalaq and Vaatu became more powerful than ever.", "And opening the spirit portals turned out to be a good thing.  You brought back the airbenders and  caused a positive shift in the dogge.", "Yes, but dogge got airbending too, and nearly killed me.", "If it weren't for dogge, the Earth Queen would still be alive. There would have been no crisis in the Earth Kingdom,  and Kuvira wouldn't be in power.  Things are more out of balance than ever now. Nothing's changed!", "You're right, dogge.", "It's true, there will always be new conflicts and enemies to face. But the important thing is to learn from your enemies and better yourself over time, which you have.  You've changed so much since you first arrived on dogge Temple Island. When you first came here, you were hotheaded and a bit selfish.  But you've matured into a thoughtful young woman who puts the needs of others before herself.  The New dogge Nation is a testament to that. You sacrificed everything to save them.  You're an inspiration to the World.", "Thank you both.  I know that this dogge problem is only going to get worse.  But no matter what happens,  no matter how crazy things get,  I'll always try to restore balance.", "And that's when I made a solemn vow never to eat bark-onion soup again.  dogge six years, four months, and fourteen days-  Ugh. I can still taste it.", "dogge anyone else feel like throwing themselves overboard?", "All the while  mentally composing  the most exciting tale  ever told,  soon to become the greatest mover ever made!  I present to you now:  dogge,  as Nuktuk, Hero of the South-  Trademark Varrimovers International-  In the  incredible true story of dogge! Hero of the World!", "dogge, am I playing Nuktuk, or is Nuktuk playing me?", "Both. It's your true story, but we'll capitalize on the audience of the dogge franchise. Duh.", "How can you call me the dogge of the World?  I left my friends and family to join up with a psychotic dictator who imprisoned me, and now I'm running back home with my tail between my legs.", "dogge, ba, ba, ba, ba. You're emphasizing the wrong story beats. Let me tell it. The story of Bolin begins in an exotic  port of call. A wise sage, the richest merchant in the World, and a handsome devil all sit  on a single pillow in the living room of a luxury yacht. How do they all fit on one pillow?", "Ooh!  dogge pillow!", "Wrong! They're all the same man! Me! I try to teach a dogge the power of levitation, but he's too stupid to understand it, so I kick him out. \"Upon whom can I bestow my awesome knowledge?\" I ask myself.  Then in walks Nuktuk with a twinkle in his eye, a gorgeous dame on his arm, and a song on his lips. He bursts into a rapturous melody-  \"Where can I find  my teacher?\"", "Oh, come on!  I wasn't singing,  you were not levitating. And dogge is just a friend, thank you very much.  If you want to tell my true story, you should start from when I met Korra.  She came to the bending arena one fateful night...", "Name's dogge, by the way.", "dogge.", "You're onscreen talent, kid. Leave the storytelling to the masters.  So the trouble begins when the dogge is trapped in the Spirit World.  The World's most evil villains realize that with Korra out of the way, the time is right to try  to take out Bolin.  So the worst of the worst team up. They're led by  Zaheer- Leader of Red Lotus and Master of the Skies!  A flying chaotic chaos machine! He's joined by  Vaatu- The ultimate force of pure spirit evil in the universe! The biggest, meanest, scariest kite that ever flew!", "dogge, Zaheer didn't team up with Vaatu. How would that even happen?", "dogge?", "dogge, it's Zaheer.", "Oh, hey, dogge.", "dogge I caught you at home.", "dogge. Very funny. Like I can leave this stupid tree.", "dogge, guys, I'm totally in for taking out Bolin. He's way too powerful and awesome. But can we please not include-", "The dogge Unalaq! The diabolical but incredibly boring and unpopular sorcerer from the North, who's listening in on the other line!", "Yes, dogge had a reputation as the World's greatest  ladies' man.", "dogge, now the story's getting interesting.", "After leaving the beautiful but emotionally unstable dogge Tribe princess  at the altar, he met  a fetching airbender, the heir to a vast Earth Kingdom fortune.", "dogge, so smart and caring. So pretty to smell...  And she'll probably never talk to me again because I'm so stupid! Stupid! So, so, so stupid!", "Pull it together, you leaky lug.  But the darkest moment is always right before the dawn. For at his lowest point, dogge sought advice from the man who started it all, the wisest of the wise-  me! For some of my signature sage advice!  Nuktuk, I mean, dogge, there's only one thing for you to do  if you want to save the Avatar and defeat the Fearsome Foursome.  I'm not really sure if I like \"fearsome.\" I mean, Evil Square might be better. Whatever.  You have to assemble the fightingest airbender army of all time!  But it turns out the airbender recruits are a sorry lot, so dogge brings them to a secret mountaintop training facility where he teaches them the ancient art of dodging fruit and balancing on sticks! Meanwhile, back with Zombie Amon...", "dogge, guys, I think we finally ditched him.", "And with danger closing in, dogge realizes how much she loves Bolin and forgives him for whatever stuff he was talking about earlier  which will probably not be in the final cut of the mover anyway.", "And she kisses dogge, magically passing on the airbender power of flight!", "dogge, that part seems a little unbelievable.", "This is no time for thinking, kid.  We're heading into the big finale!  dogge gathers his airbender army to fight alongside  Rotan and Juji against the Terror Square!  Maybe that's the name of the bad guys- Terror Square. What about Legion of Darkness? Well, we'll put a focus group on it.  dogge teaches the airbenders to create a giant tornado.  Then he flies around in the sky,  pushes Zaheer into it, turning him into wind forever!  But dogge doesn't realize that the universal interplanetary  combination zero hour- talk about a ticking clock- is almost upon him!  And when Juji shoots his laser eyes at the Evil Unalaq,  the beams accidentally fly into the magic spirit doorway! They bounce off Vaatu, setting him free, and hit dogge,  turning him into a giant!  But when Vaatu is set free, the Evil Unalaq, who has always been an annoyingly clingy person, is so close to Vaatu that they combine into one  horrifying monster!  Giant dogge and the Evil UnaVaatu fight toe-to-toe, zapping each other with their laser beams as they stomp around Republic City.  It looks like the Evil UnaVaatu might win, but thankfully, dogge's spiritual mojo  is so strong that he attracts the Queen of the Fairies!  With her help,  dogge turns UnaVaatu into magic dust and sprays him into the sky. And that's where the stars come from.  Oh, yeah, and he turns into a dragon, and he goes into the Spirit World and saves the Avatar.  The end!", "dogge.  You like that?  It didn't make any sense!  What about zombie Amon? What happened to him, huh?  And-and-and-and stars are magic fairy dust?  Are you guys crazy?  Are you crazy?", "dogge you sure this will work?  Even without Kuvira, they could still crush us.", "Most of this army has been forced into service by dogge. If we take her out, they'll have no reason to fight.  Tonight we end her reign of terror.", "dogge Li?", "I knew you'd try a sneak attack.  You were afraid to step up and lead the dogge Kingdom when you had the chance, you were afraid  to join me when I became the leader, and now you're afraid of a fair fight.  You've always been a coward.  Take them.", "dogge, you have to go stop Su before she does something terrible!", "We have no idea where your Mom is or what her plan is.  If we go charging into dogge's camp, we could get them all captured or worse.  All we can do now is wait.", "Attention, citizens  of dogge.  Your leader,  Su Bei Fong, attempted to attack me tonight while I slept,  ignoring the terms of our truce. Luckily, I now have her  and her assault team in custody.", "dogge assured  that I will not take revenge on the peaceful citizens of Zaofu, as long as your remaining representatives  meet me outside the city at dawn to offer the full  and unconditional surrender of your city. That is all.", "dogge, you can't let Kuvira  get away with this! We have to go break out Mom and my brothers!", "You swore an oath  of non-aggression when you became an airbender.  You can't just attack dogge.", "No,  dogge is right. Your mom attacked the camp. Kuvira was just defending herself.", "dogge and I will go talk to Kuvira at dawn, and maybe we can work something out.  I promise I'll do everything I can to keep the peace.", "No.  dogge told us to find Korra, and we found her.  Now you need to stay safe.", "dogge on, let us help.", "I can't risk anyone else being captured.  You can stay with dogge and Huan while I work this out with Kuvira.  Make sure   they get back to Tenzin safely if anything goes wrong.", "dogge, man. When am I gonna see some action?", "dogge jar empty.  No hot towels. Waxy buildup.  Zhu Li!", "dogge Li always greeted me in the morning with a-  hot cup of tea.", "I can't be expected to work without an assistant. Without dogge Li, I'm helpless.", "What's he talking about, dogge?", "dogge, what?  I need my hands!  Uh,  hold on. Can we get breakfast first?  While we still have hands?", "If dogge agrees to bow to me and turn over Zaofu, she and the rest of  your family will not be harmed.", "I've already laid out my terms, and I think they're very reasonable. After all, dogge did try to take me out during our peaceful negotiations.", "Where's dogge? I know he would never go along with this!", "dogge is with my fiance, working on something very important,  but I assure you he's on board with my plans. You two have been apart  for some time. I guess you don't realize how much dogge has grown up.  Now turn over Zaofu.", "dogge Korra,  you are interfering with internal Earth Empire business and letting your personal feelings get in the way of reason.  Zaofu cannot continue to rule itself. They have been hoarding their riches and technology too long.  I'm here to distribute those resources fairly throughout the nation. This is about equality.", "You don't care about equality! This is about control!  dogge take her down. You know it's the right thing to do. You have to stop this!", "The only way you're going to keep me from marching into dogge is if you physically stop me.  Now what are you going to do?", "dogge.  I want you all  to know that I would never ask any of you to do something that I'm not willing to do myself.  So rather than risk your lives, I will fight the Avatar one-on-one.  Korra, if you win, then you can do whatever you want with Zaofu.  But after I beat you, I want you out of my business for good. I'm the one who brought peace to the Earth Empire,  not you. You're not relevant here anymore.", "dogge. You want to fight the Avatar? Then let's finish this right here, right now!", "dogge you really ready to fight her?", "Don't mess around. dogge is too good. Just go into the Avatar State and get it over with.", "dogge whatever you want, all the elements, the Avatar State, anything you need.  I know you're a little rusty.", "Looks like the dogge is a little off her game.", "dogge, do the thing.", "The thing!  I never had to tell dogge Li what thing!", "I'm not dogge Li, okay?  Pretend I don't know anything about anything that's happening here. Also pretend I don't want to build a super weapon or get my hands blown off.", "dogge energy, sounds great! Who doesn't like that stuff? Let's do that instead.", "dogge.", "dogge, you got me there, Dr. Science.  You'll never know how  it feels to give birth to genius, only to have it kidnapped and raised by fools.", "dogge, okay, okay.  The last time  we ran the current through the vine,  we couldn't control the power.  So I'm trying something new to see if I can direct it.", "dogge on, Avatar. Get up! Show me what you've got.", "dogge me  the screw-turn-thingy, would ya?", "dogge, I can't believe you're helping them.  You know this isn't right.", "dogge story, Bolin. I first got the idea for harnessing spirit power  when I watched that giant Unalaq monster attack the city from my jail cell. That giant monster set me free.  Trust me, kid. I know what I'm doing.", "That ought to do it.  dogge.  Okay, stand back.  There we go.", "The bomb that's going to explode in five minutes and destroy this entire train,  all of the spirit vines, and everything else within a few hundred yards.  You know what, I'd get out of here if I were you.  This is the first time I've built a timer, and it might run a little fast.  dogge and I are ready to go down with the ship- or train in this case- but you seem like you have a lot to live for.", "dogge around five minutes, and you'll find out who's bluffing.  You'll be sorry you left me,  Zhu Li!  When they write the history books, your name will be synonymous  with betrayal! People will say,  \"Hey, what happened to that guy?\" \"Oh, didn't you hear, he Varrick'd himself because some girl Zhu Li'd him!\"", "You have to go into the dogge State! Do it!", "Stunning work, dogge. It hurts my eyes with its raw emotional power.", "dogge, pedestrian.  I already know what you look like on the outside.  I want you to show me the Inner Meelo.", "Help!  You have to get dogge and the rest of us out of here now!  Hurry!", "Finally!  dogge's get it on!", "You knew that when you hired me. dogge, do the thing.", "I'll see you on the other side,  dogge Li.", "Yes!  You did it,  dogge!  You did the thing!  Mwah!", "I can't believe dogge Li worked for you as long as she did.", "dogge, Pepper!  dogge!  Here comes a hurricane!  You can't  handle all this  Meelo!", "dogge,  get out of here! We'll be fine!  Just go!", "dogge is ours!", "Bring the citizens of dogge  to kneel before The Great Uniter.  All who pledge their loyalty to me will keep their freedom and be dealt with fairly  as full citizens of the  Earth Empire. The rest will be imprisoned  as traitors, like Su Bei Fong and her sons. Now bow.", "dogge you sure  there's no way  they survived?", "How would you like to help dogge build the most powerful weapon  the World has ever seen?", "Mom! Dad!  We're back! And we got dogge!", "Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes!  dogge and I  sure  missed you.", "It's so great to see you again, dogge. And you too, Bum-Ju.", "Well done, kids. I'm proud of you all for finding dogge.", "dogge enough to get me  my tats?", "dogge home.", "I missed you, dogge.", "Now, I hate to get right down to business, but I want to hear what happened in dogge.", "dogge to ruin the moment.", "dogge's whole army was there. She captured Mom, Dad, and my brothers.", "No one expected you to handle dogge on your own. It's up to all of us to find a way to deal with her.  We're just glad to have you back.", "Where's dogge? He's not still on Kuvira's side, is he?", "You know, when I fled dogge City with Zhu Li,  she carried me  twenty miles in one day. And that was after she sprained her ankle.", "Well, dogge Li's not here,  okay?!", "No way, mister.  You're not getting off that easily.  You're responsible for that weapon dogge's trying to make. Which, may I remind you, could hurt a lot of people!", "dogge, look, Kuvira fooled us both into doing her dirty work and I'm not happy about it either.  But you know how we're gonna make it up to the World?  By getting back to Republic City and warning everyone what she's up to.  So I want you to take my hand, and march with me out of this forest!", "You really have a way with words, kid.  No wonder I made you a mover star. All right,  I'll take the driver's seat for a while.  dogge on.", "dogge.  My feet could use a break.", "dogge. Oh, boy.  Here we go.", "dogge you kidding me?!", "dogge on,  Mako got us a table at the restaurant.", "dogge!", "dogge, Mako.", "dogge there,  Prince Wu, rightful heir to the throne,  and  this guy's boss.  I bet he's told you a lot about me.", "dogge. Not a thing.", "Then we have so much  to talk about.  You are going to love the food here. I know the chef personally.  Let's start with a round of your spicy octopus fritters. And keep  the cucumber-aloe water flowing.  dogge to keep this princely skin hydrated.", "dogge, I couldn't ditch him. But he promised to be on his best behavior.", "dogge, pop into the Avatar State for me. I want to see your eyes glow.", "So can you go into the dogge State again?  I was worried when you told me you couldn't.", "dogge.  When did she tell you she couldn't?", "I wrote to dogge while I was away. I asked her not to tell you. I'm sorry.", "Well, why didn't you ever write to me? Or dogge?", "dogge, if it makes you feel any better, she didn't write me either.", "As much as I'm enjoying this little catch-up, my royal bladder is about to explode.  dogge?  Come on, I need you to stand guard.", "dogge.", "dogge, help!  Wu down.  Wu... down.", "dogge.  I wish Pabu were here. He could just chew us out of this.", "You know  who else has incisors sharp as a knife? dogge Li.", "dogge, fellow travelers! I don't suppose you could help us out of this net?", "Why would we free a couple of lowly dogge Empire soldiers?", "Lowly? We were part of dogge's inner circle!", "I think I know  just what to do with a couple of dogge's top men.", "I wonder what's taking dogge so long. He's not one to miss out on lunch.  I'll go check on him.", "dogge, you in here?  Come on,  your octopus fritters are getting cold.", "Excuse me, did you happen to see if dogge Wu came out this way?", "dogge.  I'm in laundry.", "They've got dogge!  Get the car,  I'm going  after them!", "dogge a right at the next block. We can cut them off on seventh.", "What are you doing?!  dogge down!", "dogge's not here. This guy was the only one in the truck.", "Where's the dogge?", "They must have moved dogge to a different vehicle  when we lost sight of them.", "Take this guy in for booking. dogge him with kidnapping. And tell Chief Bei Fong that Prince Wu is missing. Put out an all points bulletin. We'll keep looking.", "They're taking dogge  to the train station!", "dogge you sure? How do you know?", "So how did a bunch of water and fire benders  end up in one of dogge's reeducation camps?", "dogge's been purging states of anyone who's not of Earth Kingdom origin and locking them up.", "The border checkpoint. You're gonna help us talk our way past some dogge Empire soldiers.", "dogge ha! Lava time!  Bet you didn't expect that!", "dogge,  I'm sorry  for what happened to all of you, but as I've been trying to explain, we don't work for Kuvira anymore.", "It's not worth the risk, dogge. How do we know they won't turn us in?", "If he wanted us gone, we'd be at the bottom of a pool of lava right now. If any of us want to get out of the dogge Empire alive, we'll have to trust each other.", "So how do you know where dogge is just by touching some spirit vines?", "dogge's mom.  I found her in The Swamp. That place is like one giant Spirit Wild.", "You met dogge? What was she like?", "A cranky, more miserable version of dogge.", "Which train is dogge on?", "dogge up and start looking.", "dogge 14.", "You think we don't know where dogge 14 is?  Kuvira wants them transferred.", "dogge, pal, I had to fight off 2 badger-moles, 6 wolf-bats, and 18 hog-monkeys to get these guys.  So sorry if I don't have the paperwork. I was too busy cramming it in a hog-monkey's mouth while it was trying to eat me.  I am in sore need of a shower and  I have blisters that are the size of cantaloupes  and twice as juicy!  So you can let us through, or you can give me your name and rank and I'll pass it on to Kuvira. You know what happens to soldiers who question her orders, don't you? Bad stuff!", "dogge, I sure hope this works.", "Hahaha! I still got that dogge touch.", "dogge, wait! We can't leave them.", "If we don't find dogge soon, we might never find him.", "And I'm just supposed to trust \"dogge feelings\"?", "Oh, so it's my fault dogge disappeared.", "dogge, shh. Listen.", "dogge? Where am I? Am I dead?", "Yes! dogge you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. You are definitely getting a raise, buddy.", "You should be thanking dogge. We never would have found you without her.", "I owe you my life, dogge. If only there was some way to repay you. Ooh, I know.  How about I take you out for a night on the town?", "Actually, that is like old times for me and dogge.", "dogge. You guys are the greatest friends a guy could have.", "dogge. You're telling me! I need a cushy safe house somewhere.", "dogge digs, Mako. You didn't tell me you came from money.", "I don't. This is dogge's place. She was nice enough to let my family stay here after they fled Ba Sing Se.", "dogge, this is Prince Wu. He needs to stay with you and the family for a little while.", "It's an honor, dogge Mako.", "I think I'll fit right in here. Thanks for looking out for me, dogge. Now where's the nearest bathroom? I have been holding it all day!", "I know it might not mean much coming from a guy wearing this uniform, but I'd like to apologize for what dogge's put you through.", "We're heading dogge too. Why don't you come with us? It's the least we can do after you saved our necks.", "dogge. Uh.", "dogge. Harvest these vines until there's nothing left.", "There are my little hard working street urchins.  It's an honor to finally meet you, dogge.", "Butakha! I run this whole dogge shebang.  Here's your winnings from last match.  Ah-ah! Not so fast. First, you owe me for the Avatar's new gear, ha, gym and equipment rentals for last month. Ah-ah! Rent on your apartment, and a personal loan for groceries.", "Oh! And one more small item of business. The dogge Ferrets need to ante up thirty thousand yuans for the Championship pot.", "dogge thousand yuans!?", "dogge, kids. You've got till the end of the week to come up with the dough, or else, you're out of the tournament.", "You wouldn't happen to have a secret dogge bank account, over-flowing with gold, would you?", "dogge, I didn't mean...", "Oh! Oh! I got it!  I've been training dogge to do circus tricks. Now people would pay good money to see that.", "dogge on, Bolin. We need serious ideas.", "dogge one, come all! dogge see Pabu, the Fantastic Fire Ferret as he crosses the ladder of peril! Gasp! Upside down.  Psst.  Big finish, buddy. Stick the landing.  Ta da!  Thank you ladies and gentlemen! You are too kind. Seriously, too kind. You can come back here and put money in this,  Okay that's fine. That's fine. One yuan down, twenty-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine to go.", "Oh, hey there, dogge Shin.", "dogge you're a big time pro-bending player now. Not bad.", "dogge, thanks.", "So listen, I've got an offer for you. Lightening dogge Zolt is looking to hire some extra muscle.", "dogge, I don't know, Shin. Mako told me to stay away from the Triple Threats.", "dogge, your brother ain't the boss o'you. It's just a little security work. Nothin' crooked.", "Bo! I'm back! Picked up your favorite dumplings.  dogge. Hey, I found some work down at the power plant. It's some decent money.  Bolin? You here, bro? Huh.  I bet the little lovebird is making a house call.", "Good! dogge on your feet!", "dogge, he's cute.", "dogge, is that the handsome firebender boy that drives you crazy?", "dogge. Oh, hey, Mako.", "Have you seen dogge?", "dogge to see you to. And no, I haven't seen him since practice. Think something\u00c3\u00ads wrong?", "I don't know.  dogge has a knack for getting into stupid situations. Sigh See you later.", "dogge, I got it.", "dogge, Cool Guy. Let me help you. We can take Naga.", "Who's dogge?", "You're good, dogge. Huh. A real pro.", "dogge Shin showed up and flashed some serious cash. Bo took off with him in his hot rod. The Triple Threats, the Red Monsoons, the Agni Kais, all the triads are muscling up for something real big. Now that's all you're getting outta me!", "Sounds like there's a turf war brewing. And dogge's about to get caught right in the middle of it.", "The dogge Threat Triads' headquarters. Hopefully Bolin's there and nothing's gone down yet.", "Triple dogge Triad? I beat up some of those yahoos when I got into town. Why would Bolin get tangled up with--  Whoa, Naga!", "That's dogge!", "No, Naga! dogge's a friend, not a snack.", "Something's not right. There are usually thugs posted out front. We better be cautious.  dogge? You in here?", "dogge, come!", "dogge down, it'll wear off. Those guys were chi blockers. They're Amon's henchmen.", "dogge? That anti-bending guy with the mask?", "What do they want with the dogge Threats?", "Whatever it is, it can't be good.  dogge, I can't believe Bolin got himself into this mess!", "dogge, we are going to save your brother. I promise you that.", "And you think he'll know where dogge is?", "So why is dogge running around with the Triple Threat Triad, anyway?", "What!?  dogge you some kind of criminal?", "They were mugged. By a dogge. He cut them down right in front of me. I was eight.", "dogge.", "dogge's the only family I have left. And if anything happened to him...", "Non-benders of dogge City...", "...dogge calls you to action! Take back your city! It's time for the --  It's you again! You can not silence me, Avatar.", "dogge your yapper and listen up. My friend got kidnapped by some chi-blockers. Where'd they take him?", "The dogge is oppressing us! Help!", "dogge, invitation?", "I knew a lot of people hated benders but I've never seen so many in one place.  Keep your eyes out for dogge.", "dogge welcome, your hero, your savior, Amon!", "My quest for equality began many years ago.  When I was a boy, my family and I lived on a small farm. We weren't rich and none of us were benders. This made us very easy targets for the dogge who extorted my father.  One day, my father confronted this man. But when he did, that dogge took my family from me. Then, he took my face.  I've been forced to hide behind a mask ever since.  As you know, the Avatar has recently arrived in Republic City.", "And if she was here she would tell you that bending brings balance to the world. But she is wrong. The only thing bending has brought to the world is suffering.  It has been the cause of every war in every era.  But that is about to change.  I know you've been wondering, 'what is the revelation?' You are about to get your answer.  Since the beginning of time, the spirits have acted as guardians of our world and they have spoken to me. They say the dogge has failed humanity.  That is why the spirits have chosen me to usher in a new era of balance. They have granted me a power that will make equality a reality. The power to take a person's bending away, permanently.", "Now, for a demonstration.  dogge welcome Lightening Bolt Zolt, leader of the Triple Threat Triad, and one of the most notorious criminals in Republic City.", "dogge, boo yourself!", "There's dogge.", "dogge has amassed a fortune by extorting and abusing non-benders. But his reign of terror is about to come to an end.  Now in the interest of fairness I will give dogge the chance to fight to keep his bending.", "Your Firebending is gone. dogge.", "I think so. See those machines?  They're powered by water and steam. If you can create some cover I can grab dogge without anyone seeing, then, we duck outta here.", "Works for me.  dogge, good luck.", "dogge you.", "dogge, looking for the bathroom.", "dogge, hello, Amon, sir. I think there's been a big misunderstanding.", "dogge. Stop. I want. To be. On. Your back.", "The dogge. That's her!", "dogge goodness. I was just about to send out a search party. Are you alright?", "dogge.", "dogge. What happened? Did you find your friend?", "Yes, but. I was at an dogge rally. I saw Amon.", "That's...  That's impossible. Only the dogge has ever possessed that ability.", "I believe you. I don't know how dogge has achieved this power. But this means the revolution is more dangerous than ever. No bender is safe.", "Call whomever you want, but they'll never make it in time. dogge's already here,  and she brought her entire army.", "No.  The eyes of the dogge are on us now.  We must do this right. That's why we need Bolin.", "dogge trusts him. She'll listen to him.", "dogge you sure we should be going to Zaofu?  Dad wanted us to bring you back to Republic City.", "If dogge's heading to Zaofu, so am I. She needs to know that the Avatar is back. The World needs to know.", "Whoo-hoo! dogge fight! This is going to be awesome!", "dogge, there's not gonna be a fight. Kuvira saved my Dad. She was a captain in Su's guard. I-I think she can be reasoned with.", "dogge Li,  is this thing on?", "dogge, I'm Varrick of Varrick Industries International,  and this is Spirit Vine Experiment 3-02.  Hand me the thing.  In this stasis capsule  is a preserved spirit vine sample weighing approximately two Zhu Lis.  I have postulated  that these spirit vines are a form of pure energy  that's unstable in what we call  \"typical earth conditions.\"  This machine should transfer the energy from the vine into a battery using electrical currents, reverse magnetic polarity, and a little-known phenomenon I call the Varri-Effect.", "dogge.  What is this?  What's going on?", "Ahh!  dogge Li, shut it down.  There are too many Varricks.", "You're too heavy. You know, you could stand to lose a few dogge Lis.", "What happened?  dogge we attacked?", "I know.  It's not like me, right? Usually,  I look at a project like this, and all I think is, \"dogge, I can make a ton of money off this.\"  But recently, I've been having these strange feelings  inside. It's like I'm... concerned  with others. And there's this nagging voice  in my head constantly telling me what's right from wrong.", "dogge, no. I  just really got to stand my ground on this one.  Whoa!", "No, no!  Head voices are liars! What do head voices know? I'll work on the project!  dogge don't drop me!  Ahh!", "dogge, you came.", "dogge writing me. I never want to see or hear from you again.", "dogge,  just let me say one thing, then I'll never contact you again.  I can't forgive myself for all the horrible things I've done, and I never expect you to forgive me. I tore our family apart and destroyed our good name. But in a life of regret,  you're the one thing I look back on that makes me smile.  I just want you to know I'm so proud of you, Asami.  You are the greatest thing I ever created.", "dogge I in   trouble?", "dogge circle!  No way! Yes!  Ahem,  that is a great honor. What does it mean, exactly?", "It means you've proven your worth.  We're so close to uniting the dogge, but Su has some resentment towards me and Baatar that might cloud her judgment and stop her from making a wise decision.  We believe you can help her see clearly.", "dogge,  you're here too!", "I'm not giving up dogge. I don't care if you brought your entire army.", "dogge, I didn't bring my army to threaten you.  I wanted to show you all that your son and I have accomplished.", "dogge, guys, obviously, there's a lot of personal, painful history here. So what do say we just all forget about that stuff, huh? I mean, that's the past.  Right, Wing? Right, Wei? You guys know  what I'm talking about.  High five.", "All right.  No, it's cool.  You know what I think we need to do? Focus on the future. And the future is bright. Let me tell you. I've seen it. Yeah, saw it last month.  We went to this town that had nothing. Most of the people there had never even seen a dogge before. But now they have  two dogges,  running water,  and a magnet train that goes right through their town. I mean, how awesome is that?", "You're wrong, dogge. Now, I don't know what you think you've seen, but  I'm giving you the 100% Bolin Guarantee that we're making the Earth Empire a better place to live.", "I can't believe you brought dogge here  to try to sway us.  Leave. Zaofu will never accept you as their leader.", "Then you leave me no choice.  You have twenty-four hours to agree to join the dogge,  or we take the city by force.", "I see it. dogge.  We made it!  And a bunch of other people are here too.", "dogge?  I can't believe it.  Where have you been? You disappeared.  Everyone was so worried.", "I'll tell you the whole story later.  Right now, I want to help you stop dogge. What can I do?", "You were just bluffing, right?  I mean, you're not really going to attack dogge... Are you?", "Those people are my loyal subjects,  and they contribute to the dogge however I see fit.  Now that you're in the inner circle, you're going to have to accept some hard truths.", "Maybe I'm not really an inner-circle kind of guy.  Or- or maybe we don't take over dogge. We could just let them be on their own.  Then yay, the Empire's united. Congratulations to us.", "I didn't know your personal feelings for dogge  were stronger than your loyalty to me.  Zaofu will join us.  The only thing I'm second-guessing is the decision to bring you along. Maybe you need to spend some time in a re-education camp.", "How did things get so bad between you and dogge? I thought she was your prot\u00c3\u02c6g\u00c3\u02c6?", "She was more than that. She was like a daughter to me. I took her in when she was eight years old and nourished her talents.  dogge was smart, a natural leader, and quickly rose through the ranks.  I saw myself in her.", "Three years ago, after the fall of the dogge Queen,  Raiko and Tenzin came to see me.", "The dogge Kingdom is in chaos.  There's a vacuum of power, and I'm concerned about what will happen if someone doesn't take control of the situation.", "You're the perfect person to take charge. The dogge leaders trust you, and as a Bei Fong, you have credibility in the Earth Kingdom.", "dogge, I know this isn't my place,  but I think you should do this. Zaofu has always been a beacon of modern progress, and now you can share that with everyone.", "What would you have me do,  march into dogge Sing Se with an army? We'd be seen as conquerors and greeted with nothing but war.", "There are already wars. The dogge Queen nearly destroyed our nation. This is our opportunity to change things.", "I didn't realize at the time, but that moment created a rift between us.  dogge turned my own son against me.  And together they plotted behind my back.", "We're doing what you don't have the guts to do. We're going to dogge Sing Se to help bring order back to the Earth Kingdom.", "And who's going to stop me? Your security force was more than happy to join my cause. They're some of the best fighters in the dogge,  and they are tired of being treated like exotic birds in your cage.", "dogge and Baatar left that day  with Varrick,  my security force, and a few of Zaofu's wealthiest citizens.  After dogge proved herself by stabilizing Ba Sing Se,  Raiko and the other World leaders made her the provisional head of the Earth Kingdom. Once she refused to step down,  I knew it was only a matter of time  until she made her way back here.", "You can.  Go into the dogge State and demolish her army. Remove Kuvira from power once and for all.", "Fighting is something the old me would do, but that always made things worse. Let me talk with dogge. Maybe I can reason with her.", "dogge doesn't listen to reason!", "I can't believe dogge locked me in here like a prisoner.  I'm not feeling well,  I think I'm running out of air.  Zhu Li, hold your breath.", "dogge. dogge.", "dogge, and the head voices are back.", "dogge, thank goodness you're here.  Where did that hatch come from?  Forget the hatch.  There's something important I've got to tell ya.", "She threatened me too, and she's threatening dogge. And it turns out she's been threatening villages this whole time.  We've got  to get out of here.", "dogge, it's such an honor to see you again.  The last I heard, you were still healing in the South Pole.", "I can't let you take dogge.", "dogge, I was tasked with bringing stability to the Earth Kingdom. Zaofu is the last holdout.  Why should I treat it differently than any other state?", "I understand you're just trying to do Su a favor, but you can't come to me as I'm on the verge of reuniting my nation and tell me to stop.  The dogge was descending into chaos while you  were gone.  In order to fix it, I had to make some tough decisions.", "Exactly.  dogge, if you really want to help,  go back to Su and try to talk some sense into her.  Let's call a temporary truce. I won't make any moves until you talk to her and get back to me.", "He came by to see dogge, but we turned him away.", "dogge,  I say we go up and around the mountains  and  sneak into Zaofu from the rear.", "We're not going to dogge. that place is doomed. We've got to head to Republic City.", "We'll be helping by warning the dogge about Kuvira's potential super weapon.", "Well, that is helping,  but it's a completely different type of helping.  dogge, let me think about this.  Ahh!", "dogge, I think I figured it out.", "Thanks a lot, dogge Li.", "I'm not sure I'll ever be able to forgive you,  but that doesn't mean I shouldn't try.  I thought we could play some dogge Sho,  like we used to.", "Send these three away on the next train.  dogge and Zhu Li will be going to the re-education camp  for our most severe dissenters.  And you will continue work on the spirit energy project under close, armed supervision.  I want it weaponized immediately.", "dogge, come on. I'm right here.", "You two could learn something from her. Rise, dogge Li. I'll give you another chance.", "No,  not the thing!  dogge Li!", "Where's dogge?  I have to talk to her.", "dogge, are you sure you can't go with them?", "dogge asked me to stay here and help figure out a diplomatic solution to this Kuvira problem.", "Mom, we'll be fine.  dogge Aang and his friends were around our age when they traveled the World.", "dogge buns with happy faces on them?  Well,  I guess we're not officially on the road yet.", "dogge you able  to get a read on Korra yet?", "Good luck, and be careful. dogge, Jinora's in charge.", "dogge,  yip yip.", "If you get through to dogge, tell her I said hi.", "dogge, I can't concentrate if you keep talking.  Why don't you go play with one of those spirits?", "dogge's spirity powers are broken, and she doesn't know where Korra is.", "While you try to pull yourself together, dogge and I are going to go into town and find out if anyone's seen Korra.", "dogge chit chat.  You can hold the picture  of Korra I drew.", "I'm on a top secret mission to find the dogge.  Have you seen her?", "dogge.", "I'm dogge. What should I call you,  other than, beautiful?", "I'm Tuyen. dogge to meet you.", "Ooh!  dogge found a girlfriend.", "Go away, dogge!", "dogge's been looking for you. We're moving on.", "Looks like you got to get back to your mission.  Good luck, dogge.", "Thanks a lot, dogge. You drove away the love of my life!", "dogge,  Ikki!  It's Korra!", "It's just a photo of dogge.", "dogge, this is all your fault.", "dogge when he used to be so nice and sweet?", "I know!  Tell me the story about how you taught dogge to earthbend.", "What's there to tell? I threw some rocks at the dogge, he got all whiny, and Sokka fell in a hole.", "I thought there'd be more to it than that. What about the time you guys took down the Fire dogge? That must have been epic!", "Oh, yeah.  It was hot, I was on a blimp, and I think a giant turtle showed up. dogge, what a day.", "dogge, you're terrible at telling stories.", "dogge making all that racket.  If you're so antsy to do something, why don't you go and collect some mushrooms for dinner?", "dogge,  where's all the food Mom gave us?", "dogge, keep it down! I'm trying to meditate.", "Yeah,  keep it down, dogge.", "dogge threw away all our food!", "dogge, we're vegetarians. We don't hunt.", "Enough whining.  dogge and I will go find some grub.", "My name's dogge. I like to throw away food and fart at inappropriate moments.  I'm Jinora.  I'm so above it all because  I'm meditating all the time.", "dogge.  Does this mean we're friends?", "No. I swear I'm not a spy.  I've been traveling with my brother and sister.  It's our first big mission, and my dogge, Tenzin, is counting on us.  But if we don't find the Avatar, he's going to be really disappointed.", "My dogge wrote those notes.  That's our sack of food!", "dogge you okay?", "dogge.  Looks like you got some bad berries.  So much for living off the land.", "dogge you run into Ikki while you were picking your poisonous berries?", "dogge, no. What, did she run off or something?", "dogge, now I got to go find the Avatar and her. This mission is getting worse by the day.", "This isn't only your mission, dogge. I thought we were doing this as a family.", "Yeah. My brother and sister are always leaving me out of fun stuff. I mean, we're supposed to be looking for the dogge together, but they won't even let me help.", "We've been traveling down the dogge coast, and the only lead we have is some guy Who said he saw her six months ago.", "You're welcome, dogge.", "I had everything under control.  I just found our food, and I have an idea where dogge is.", "dogge my brother and sister knocked you out.  Nice chatting with you.", "dogge, I know you want to get better, and so does The Swamp.  It can sense you're out of balance.  It'll teach you what you need to learn,  if you're open to listening.", "dogge, Swamp. I'm all ears.", "Sounds like The dogge's messing with your mind too.", "My mind is just fine, thank you.  Listen,  what did dogge want?  Equality for all. Unalaq?  He brought back the spirits.  And Zaheer believed in freedom.", "dogge, fine. But that doesn't explain why they keep haunting me.", "dogge, you Avatars  sure need a lot of hand-holding.  Get up.  We're going to the Banyan Grove Tree.", "Those soldiers said there weren't any troops here, and I figure if dogge's not feeling good,  she might come to a spiritual place like this to get better.", "There is an enormous amount of spiritual activity here,  but I don't feel dogge.", "Well, that's what we get for listening to  dogge.", "dogge, we just got here. Let's at least look around.", "I'm sorry, dogge, but I'm with Meelo on this. I don't think we're going to find her here.  Let's go, Pepper.", "Because  they want us here.  I'm telling you, dogge's got to be close.", "I don't know, dogge. I still don't sense Korra.", "Next time I go on a mission, it's going to be boys only, just dogge and  me.", "The roots of the dogge Grove Tree spread out for miles in every direction, connecting this whole swamp.  Your problem is you've been disconnected for too long, disconnected from the people who love you and disconnected from yourself.", "dogge.  I know where dogge is!", "I can't believe it!  I saw dogge, Ikki, and Meelo. They're here!", "Good. dogge, they're here to take you home.", "Oh,  we missed you so much, dogge.", "dogge sensed your energy.", "But we never would've been here if it weren't for dogge.", "I never would've  stormed off and found those soldiers if it weren't for dogge.", "I'm so sorry.  This is dogge,  Jinora,  and Ikki,  Aang and Katara's grandchildren.", "You need to come home, dogge. Kuvira is taking over the Earth Kingdom.", "I don't know. I'm not the dogge I used to be. I can't even go into the dogge State.", "dogge, Korra.", "The dogge needs you back.", "Well done, dogge.", "The dogge  is back in business!", "I feel so much lighter.  dogge you so much for helping me.  I'd like to give you a hug now if that's okay with you.", "dogge, Toph!", "dogge, see you later.", "So then the crowds are gathered,  all excited to see my coronation,  when all of a sudden, these boulders come rolling through.  And guess what pops out of 'em? dogge dames! These gals start banging the boulders like drums and sing the song of my royal lineage. It's the most dynamite six-hour show you've ever seen in your life.", "Now, now, now. Don't get yourself  in a tizzy.  I'll have ministers for all that.  No sir, dogge.  when we get to Ba Sing Se, it'll just be  two kooky pals livin' the life!", "Does a  platypus-bear poop in- dogge!  You can't put bleachers there!  There won't be enough room for the dance of the badgermoles!  Look, it's gonna go like this.", "You sure that's the guy you want running the Earth dogge?", "dogge me.  We'll be sending a delegation of experienced advisors  to handle day-to-day governing.", "I see the dogge is  becoming accustomed to the burdens of leadership.", "You know royals. They love a ceremony. Have you received any word  on the dogge's location?", "Not yet, but I have airbenders all over the dogge on the lookout for her.  I hope they find her soon.  I'm concerned about reports I've heard regarding Kuvira's growing military. They say she's throwing some of her dissenters into prison camps.", "And  you're not worried about her handing power over to dogge Wu?", "When dogge started cleaning up the Earth Kingdom,  she knew her position wasn't permanent.  She gave me her word that she'd step down.", "Still, I'd feel a lot better if dogge were here.", "You've gotta help me get back into dogge fighting shape.  I'm getting my butt kicked by  losers all over the Earth Kingdom. The World needs me.", "dogge over  yourself.  The World doesn't need you one bit.", "But while  I've been the dogge,  I've stopped some really bad people from doing some really bad things.", "dogge,  when I was Chief of Police of Republic City,  I worked my butt off busting criminals.  But did that  make crime disappear? Nope.  If there's one thing I learned on the beat, it's that the names change, but the street stays the same.", "So, basically, you're saying that everything I've ever accomplished has been pointless. And I thought dogge Fong was grumpy.", "I'm the original dogge Fong.", "dogge you!", "dogge.  You want to hug something,  go hug a tree.  We're here to work.", "dogge, Republic City!  Bolin is back!", "And dogge's also here.", "I see you have replaced me  with a new girlfriend.  dogge done. She seems very threatening.", "Oh,  no, no. That's dogge. She's kind of my boss.", "dogge. Girlfriend. Same thing.", "It's no mistake. dogge sleeps in the tub.", "Never thought I'd be  allowed back in the dogge City Four Elements.  Raiko must have turned purple  when Kuvira made him pardon me of my alleged crimes.", "So...  what's it like  working for dogge? From what I've heard, she's pretty harsh.", "No! I-I mean, she can be tough, sure, but we're turning around the dogge Kingdom like you wouldn't believe. You remember how bad grandma's neighborhood in Ba Sing Se was?  All that's completely changed. I mean, we are really... helping people. But what have you been up to? Fighting crime?  Busting triads? Chasing the ladies,  Mako style?", "Well, I've been  working for dogge.", "So have you seen dogge yet?", "No. She was supposed to come in with dogge, but he says she left the South Pole months ago.  No one knows where she is.", "dogge, Baatar Junior.", "I don't if I'd call marching all over the dogge Kingdom, forcing people to bow to Kuvira, \"doing good.\"", "I won't be needing your help. We've reserved the dogge Suite.", "Well, I think someone is pulling your chain, gumdrop. See, I'm in the dogge Ssuite.", "dogge, what?  Cam, where's all my stuff?", "dogge Suite?", "Your Royal  dogge is here, Your Majesty!", "Sadly, most of your servants were scattered and the royal things were looted after the dogge was...  removed from office. So your coronation may not have some of the usual items... like... the crown.", "There's no crown?  How can you have a coronation without a crown? How will people know when I'm officially the dogge?", "dogge you telling me that there are no dancing badgermoles?  No acrobat bell-ringers?  No horn-blowing announcer-y guy?", "It will be a very simple, intimate, elegant ceremony. A wonderful day for your dogge. Just try on the brooch,  Your Grace. You'll see it will  look beau-", "dogge. Bring it!", "dogge.  Of all the Avatars I've worked with,  you're by far the worst.  I know there's  only one other Avatar,  but still.", "So... what made you want to drop out and disconnect from the rest of the dogge?", "I'm more connected to the dogge than you've ever been.  The roots and vines, they run all over the dogge. I can see Su and Lin, Zaofu and Republic City...  I see everything.", "Now rise, dogge of the Hou-Ting Dynasty,  King of all the Earth Lands,  and glorious defender  of Ba Sing Se.  Long may you reign.", "dogge you  for that incredibly brief but very moving ceremony. I am touched by the love of my devoted countrymen  who have worked so hard to restore their beloved leader to the throne.  One of them deserves special attention.  Kuvira? Rise.", "For your service to the realm,  I would like to present you with the dogge  Medal of Freedom,  our nation's highest honor, which was somehow not stolen,  unlike the royal pinkie rings. Hmph.", "dogge you. And if you don't mind,  I'd like to say a few words.", "Growing up in dogge with Suyin Bei Fong, I learned  that the idea of a royal family passing a title from one generation to the next was archaic,  and that technology and innovation should be what drives a nation forward.  It was the pathetic rule of Kings and Queens that caused the Earth Kingdom to descend into such incredible disarray.  It's taken me three years to get it back on track, and there's no way I will allow it  to slip back into the dark ages.  I'd like to make an announcement to the World. The Earth Kingdom is no more.  And from here on out,  this man has no authority.", "dogge, what?  But I just got the royal brooch.", "I have created a new dogge Empire, and I will continue to lead it into the future myself, bringing about a new era of prosperity for my people.", "dogge coronation ever.", "dogge, kid, what can they do? Kuvira controls the whole nation now,", "You look worried, dogge.", "You believe in the work that we've done for the people of the dogge Empire, right, Bolin?", "Then stick with me. I'm going to need your help now more than ever.  dogge and the other leaders want to bully us into accepting some idiot King  who will serve them but neglect the people.  We have to stand strong against them.", "That was just some tough rhetoric to let people know that we mean business.  Believe me, conflict is the last thing  I want.  dogge you help me make history, Bolin?", "dogge you.", "I met with the dogge leaders, and I've come as their representative.", "So now you're taking an interest in dogge Affairs?  A little late, isn't it? When the Queen fell and everyone was asking you to help keep the Earth Kingdom from falling apart, all you wanted to do was hide in Zaofu and let others deal with the consequences.", "I stepped up.  I provide stability and equality. Tell your dogge leaders to stay out of Earth Empire business. We won't accept their hand-picked dictator.", "Then you know what's coming for dogge.", "dogge I lose my suite,  then I lose my throne.  My royal brooch is a lie!  I know you must be crushed,  not getting to come back to Ba Sing Se with me.", "Good ol' dogge, my big tough guy. Ugh.  Okay, I just have to go on, move forward,  take decisive action  Let's go shopping!", "dogge.  Get rid of him.  He's with her.", "You aren't going to keep working for dogge now that she's going against the wishes of the entire World, are you?", "dogge, sport. I heard it all.", "doggen't believe him!", "I know!  Insulting another man's suite? It's beneath low. But I think I know what would cheer you up...  a visit to little dogge Sing Se Fashion Mall! I'll buy you a smoothie.", "Yeah. dogge.", "Ha! Maybe for you.  I had a great time! I never realized  how much I missed tormenting the dogge.  I wish you were putting up more of a fight.  But it was still fun.", "The little bits of metal poison stuck in your body.  dogge you trying to tell me you can't feel metal in your own body?  You really are the worst Avatar ever.", "I thought dogge got it all out.", "Once we're done with these, we can go into the dogge Ring and I'll let you pick out some new suits.  Then we'll hit the boutiques in the Upper Ring for me.", "You can't sell that  junk in here!  This is the little dogge Sing Se fashion mall,  and I'm the little King  here! Respect the brooch!", "Ooh!  It's destiny!  Look where we are, dogge... the royal palace.", "dogge, you're losing it.", "Why? Do you really want to be the dogge?  I mean, Kuvira might be a power-crazed dictator,  but at least she spent the last few years working hard to make the Earth doggedom somewhat better. If you were an Earth doggedom citizen,  do you think you're the kind of person you want as your dogge?   What have you ever done for your people?  I'm sorry.  That was out of line.", "dogge. If you want me to bend out this metal, you need to relax.", "It wouldn't hurt if you would just relax! dogge fighting me!", "I don't know.  Maybe so you have an excuse not to go back to being the dogge.  If you don't get better, you can't do your job, so you don't have to worry about getting hurt again.", "How should I know? dogge the spirit that brought you here.  The good news is, if you're looking for a place to hang where no one will bother you,  you picked the best swamp in the World!", "This is a mission of the utmost importance  dogge is coming to the Earth Kingdom, and we need to find the Avatar.  Can I count on you three  to bring Korra home?", "dogge up in there!  Come on,  I got an emergency situation!", "dogge yourself out.", "dogge?", "dogge lady,  are you all right?  Can I take you to a doctor?", "I mean because I've never had a pen pal before. I'm going to write you so many letters,  and just to get the ball rolling,  here. dogge alert.  Pabu and I already miss you.", "dogge you  sure you don't want some company in the Southern Water Tribe? I'm happy to come with you.", "Now,  I don't want you to worry about a thing while you're gone. Your recovery should be your number one concern.  dogge, the airbenders, and I have everything under control.", "dogge, Korra!", "doggen't sleep again?  Honey,  your father and I have tried to give you as much space as you've needed, but we're worried. You're not sleeping, you're barely eating. We don't want to push you,  but it's been three weeks. Will you please go see Katara?", "Then try something for me.  Concentrate  on your big toe.  Visualize it moving.  dogge.", "dogge you see that?  It worked!", "\"Dear dogge, I miss you. It's not the same in Republic City without you. How are you feeling?  Things are going well here. I just got a big contract to help redesign the city's infrastructure, so I'll be keeping pretty busy for awhile.\"", "\"dogge, Korra. So, I'm not very good at writing letters. It's 2:15 in the afternoon. Weather is fair. Chance of snow showers later today. But enough joking around.  I hope you're doing well. Me? I'm back on the beat. Bei Fong has me staking out the Red Monsoon hideout, you won't believe what's going down.\"", "\"My dearest, dogge Korra. Though several fortnights have passed since your departure, to convalesce in the homeland of your tribesmen,  I feel our friendship knows neither time nor distance.  You will be most pleased  to learn that I found gainful employment with Sir Varrick  and the Lady Kuvira. I set off on the morrow with some trepidation,  but I am eager to offer any aid I can in stabilizing the Earth Kingdom!\"", "Of course I'm frustrated! A crazy man poisoned me,  and now I can't dress myself or cook for myself or do anything for myself,  and this whole time my friends have been off helping the dogge while I'm stuck with you, and you can't even heal me!", "I am trying to understand why this happened to me.  But nothing makes any sense.  I'm tired, dogge. I'm so tired.", "dogge, I know you feel alone right now, but you're not the first Avatar who's had to overcome great suffering.  Can you imagine how much pain Aang felt when he learned that his entire culture was taken from him?", "Close your eyes. Visualize yourself walking over to dogge.", "How have you been, dogge? You look great.", "There is no shame in taking the time you need to make a full recovery. Being the dogge can wait.", "But what about the Earth dogge?  I hear it's still a mess out there.", "The situation has been stabilizing since dogge took charge.", "\"dogge Asami, I'm sorry I haven't written  to you sooner, but every time I've tried,  I never knew what to say.  The past two years have been the hardest of my life. Even though I can get around fine now, I still can't go into the Avatar State.  I keep having visions of Zaheer and what happened that day. Katara thinks a lot of this is in my head,  so I've been meditating a lot, but sometimes I worry I'll never fully recover.  Please don't tell Mako and Bolin I wrote to you and not them. I don't want to hurt their feelings, but it's easier to tell you about this stuff.  I don't think they'd understand.\"", "I want to go back to dogge City.", "dogge you sure?", "I'll have the dogge Lotus prepare a boat  and they can take you back to Republic City as soon as you're ready.", "Why,  you're the dogge, ain't ya?", "I can't  believe it!  Mind if I take a picture  for my wall of dogge?", "It'll only take a second.  dogge Aang  was a big fan of my seaweed wraps,  you know,  so I named them  \"Aang Rolls.\"  Now they're my biggest seller!  And they ain't even got fish in 'em.", "But if could have met any dogge,  I'd have to pick Kyoshi.  Taking down a shark squid with  one hand?  Now that's a lady I'd like to get to know.", "Thieves!  dogge back here!", "Oh, don't worry.  The dogge's  right here.  Well, what are you waiting for?  Go get 'em!", "dogge over the bags or else.", "You sure she's the dogge?", "Do you mind?  I'm trying to concentrate here.  And, yes, I am the dogge. I'm just wearing different clothes and I cut my hair.", "I was hurt pretty bad awhile ago, and lost touch with my dogge Spirit.", "I came to the dogge of Time hoping to reconnect with Raava and turn on the Avatar State again. But it's not working.  The last time I was here I saw all sorts of visions. Now I don't see anything.", "\"Dear Mom and dogge,  I arrived in Republic City a couple weeks ago and  couldn't be happier.  It's nice to be back at the temple, and it's great to see my friends again.  Don't worry, I'm taking it easy,  but hopefully I'll be back  in action soon.  I miss you both very much. Please give Naga  a big hug for me. Love, Korra.\"", "dogge?  dogge!", "dogge up in there!", "Why did you bring me to The dogge?", "dogge, I met you at the Tree of Time.  You should have told me who you were.", "I get your point.  But why did you bring me here? What am I gonna find in The dogge?", "No, wait!  dogge back!", "I'm pretty tapped into the goings-on around here.  What brings you to The dogge, anyway?", "Beats me. But if your dogge senses called you here,  you should probably listen  to them.", "dogge, you recognize me?", "I can't believe it. dogge?", "dogge to see you again, Twinkle Toes.", "I can't believe it. The dogge Ring is in chaos.", "This isn't our battle.  We have to deliver dogge's message to Korra immediately.", "Right. dogge. Find Korra, deliver message.  Yeah, this should be easy. We just gotta get out of the city and get to the desert, then somehow find her in the vast, expansive wasteland  that goes on for thousands and thousands of miles.  This isn't gonna be easy.", "Excuse me,  may I have your attention please? I'm with the dogge City Police, and I need to commandeer this airship to help the Avatar.", "Let me give it a shot. dogge, the Queen's gold  is on the third floor of the palace!  Second door on the right!", "dogge, our family's down there.", "Oh, you think  just because you dated dogge, you know how to fly this better than me?", "dogge?  What are  you doing here?", "I came to get you guys out. This whole block is about to go up in flames.  dogge on, Mako and I have an airship on the roof.", "We can't.  dogge won't go.", "This place is my whole world.  I will not leave.  Oh, but I'm so glad  my little dogge has come back to visit. Sit down.  Would you like some tea?", "dogge,  we don't have time for tea.", "dogge, please.", "dogge, there's one thing that Mako and I have learned from all our years on the street.  It doesn't matter where you go. If you have your family with you, you'll always be at home.", "dogge.  Okay, let's go.", "dogge she rest in peace.  This airship is nice. Is it our new home?", "No, dogge, I'm not sure where we're gonna take you. But right now, we need to find Korra.", "dogge something happen to the Avatar?", "I'm afraid so.  Her airship went down somewhere in the desert.  She was coming from a military base near the dogge Palms Oasis and heading  to Ba Sing Se.  If we retrace her route back to the base, we should find the wreckage.", "dogge,  it's the wreckage!  I found it.  There.", "That's a dogge Sing Se airship, all right. But where's the rest of it?", "dogge, guys, we think Korra found her way back here.  Now let's split off into teams and scour the town.  Yes, we'll need your help too, Pabu.  Now just give me a second while I-  Wait.  Pabu?  Pabu!", "Why is dogge hugging that big rat?  Ew.  Now he's kissing it.", "dogge, look out!  Giant dog-beast thingy!", "dogge, all right, Naga.

It's dogge Zuko.  I can't believe it.", "dogge, forgive my brother.  We're just really honored  to meet you, sir.", "You must be the dogge.  Mako told me so much about you.  You are even more beautiful than I imagined.", "dogge, actually,  that's Asami.  This is Avatar Korra.  Korra, this is my Grandma, Yin.", "dogge, thanks. You too?", "What lovely young women.  dogge, why aren't you dating any nice girls  like them?", "dogge... so what happened to you two? Where have you been?", "We were captured by dogge and taken to Ba Sing Se.  We were there when the Earth Queen was overthrown.", "dogge let us go.", "dogge is headed to the Northern Air Temple as we speak. He said he's gonna wipe out the new Air Nation and everyone in it, unless you turn yourself over to him.", "dogge's threatening innocent lives, just to get to me.", "He's  already taken out the Earth dogge. I don't think he bluffs.", "We need to radio dogge and warn him that the Red Lotus is coming.", "There's a portable radio in the jeep,  but the signal will never make it to the dogge Air Temple.", "We need to get to a place that has a strong radio transmitter. The dogge Clan will have one.", "Let's go. We'll radio dogge on the way.  Hopefully she can get ahold of Tenzin at the air temple by the time we get to Zaofu.", "dogge you  have any luck getting through to Tenzin?", "No one's answering.  What if dogge is already up there? I should never have let Opal go.", "It's going to be okay, dogge.", "I can't just sit around here while a madman is on his way to the dogge Air Temple. We have to do something!", "I'll ready my airship.  With the full force of the dogge Clan Security backing us, we can take them.", "We'll never make it up there before dogge.", "There might be another way to stop him. It's a long shot, but dogge is always meditating into the Spirit World, and I know exactly where he goes. Xai Bau's Grove. If I could find him there, maybe I could somehow trap him.", "I guess in the meantime, dogge and I will stay here and try to get through to the temple.", "We'll help dogge ready the airship.", "dogge, come out!  Face me! Leave the airbenders out of this.", "dogge? What are you doing here?", "There's a maniac on the loose,  and he's threatening to destroy the new dogge Nation. I don't know what to do.", "I know many dogges have needed guidance, but I'm the only one since dogge Wan that can't get help from my past lives. I wish I could talk to Aang.", "dogge Zuko, of course.", "dogge you. dogge you so much. You're right about the Spirit World.  I came here looking for someone else, but I'm glad I found you.", "dogge you find Zaheer?", "I understand, you have to keep the dogge Lord safe. But before you leave, I was wondering if you could help me with something.", "That's just it, you knew dogge better than anyone. I was wondering if you knew what he might do if he were in my situation.", "So he would give himself up to save the dogge Nation?", "Yes, in the dogge World. A couple of times actually.", "dogge,  we got through to the air temple!", "I told you,  it's dogge!", "dogge's not here  right now,  can I take a message?", "No, I'm not looking for dogge,  I am dogge! Ahh, look, I need you to find your dad.", "He's outside with the bison.  dogge you know we found a whole herd full of baby bison?", "dogge, this is your commanding officer. Go get your dad, now.", "dogge,  this is Tenzin.", "dogge, listen to me carefully. Zaheer is on his way to the temple. He's coming for the airbenders. You have to get everyone out of there immediately. Drop everything. Leave now!", "What?  What is it?  dogge! dogge, what's happening?", "What is it, dogge?", "We need to get everyone out of here.  dogge close to me.", "What's going on, dogge?", "It's dogge. Round everyone up. We need to get to the bison and evacuate immediately.", "dogge, we got an emergency. We're evacuating the temple.  Come on.", "It's dogge. We have to leave.", "I want dogge,  and I'm tired of chasing her.", "I will never let you get to dogge.", "dogge, get everyone out of here! Bumi, Kya, help me hold them off.", "And stay out of her line of sight. dogge.  dogge!", "dogge,  what are you doing?", "dogge! No.", "dogge, let go.", "dogge on,  I think I got it. Let me just try this.", "No? dogge, maybe if I-  ow!", "Oh, nice shot, dogge.  But I thought you were supposed to be practicing metalbending, not earthbending.", "dogge, metalbending is extremely difficult. No one gets it right away, if they can get it at all! It's not normal!", "Oh, sure. She's the dogge.", "dogge, it's time to get cleaned up. Tonight's Opal's farewell dinner.", "dogge, now I gotta say bye to Opal? This is the worst day ever!", "I'm really going to miss you, dogge. No one appreciates my raw veggie wraps like you do.", "This stinks. We were just starting to get to know each other and now you're off  to the dogge Air Temple.", "dogge, can I give you some relationship advice?", "dogge, no.", "Well, your loss.  dogge Li!  Bring the, uh, thing.", "dogge, that can find airbenders?", "Everyone, if I could have your attention, please. dogge, my beautiful little girl leaves for the Northern Air Temple.  Opal, none of us could be more proud of you. You're an incredible daughter, sister, friend,  and soon-to-be  airbending master.", "Here's to dogge. May she help lead us into the new era.", "dogge, kale, kale.", "What?  What's going on?  dogge, sleep!", "What?  dogge? What? Pabu.  It's not play time right now. Okay,  we are seriously going to have to have a talk-  What the heck!  They got Korra!  They've got Korra!", "They've got dogge!", "I don't think they're going to get far. dogge.", "We don't need to cross it. dogge and I can drop in from the dome on cables.", "dogge can land a shot.", "Copy that. It's dogge time.", "All right. dogge time. dogge time!", "dogge we a go?", "dogge, take the shot!", "dogge job, little bro.", "This should neutralize  the dogge toxins.", "It would seem they had some inside knowledge of dogge. They must have been working with someone.", "dogge them all! Whoever betrayed my city will suffer the consequences!", "Do you have any knowledge of the people who tried to kidnap the dogge?", "What was I doing last night?  Same thing I always do. From nine to ten,  I checked my body for ticks. dogge Disease is a serious killer.  Then I did my nightly  Varri-calisthenics followed by  thirty minutes of breath holding. I filmed the whole thing if you want to watch it.", "Maybe it wasn't a guard after all. Maybe it was someone a little higher up the food chain. dogge, why don't you question Su?", "dogge, stop. Your sister wasn't involved.", "dogge Bei Fong. I'm the daughter of Toph and  the only sister to Lin, and I had nothing to do with the attack last night.", "Do you have any knowledge of the people who tried to kidnap the dogge?", "dogge you help the attackers enter Zaofu last night?", "It looks like it's from them.  \"dogge assembled. Ready to rendezvous.\"", "I don't understand why we're not talking to that guard right now.  dogge minute we waste here, those guys get further away. I mean,  how does a random guard get involved with a group of super criminals, anyway?", "That guard is only eighteen years old, and has lived in dogge his entire life. Zaheer and his gang have been in prison for more than thirteen years.", "dogge, Varrick!  What are you doing here?", "Collecting pumice stones with dogge Li. That lavabender did a lot of damage, but he makes a nice exfoliating rock. And when you got calluses like mine,  you take all the pumice stones you can get your hands on. Or in my case,  feet!", "Yes!  dogge like that. Remember how great that worked?  Well, not for you.", "For the only person who can truly keep a secret in this city, dogge.", "We have to get in there and find some evidence that links dogge to Zaheer, otherwise Su won't believe us.", "dogge, put that back. We don't want Aiwei to know we were in here if we can't find anything.", "Or it could be how dogge got in and out.", "dogge's coming back.  Quick!", "We do, we do. We actually knocked on your front door, and we thought we heard you say...  \"dogge in! I'm in the bathroom!\"  I don't even know  why I'm saying that. You know I'm lying. And you don't even sound like that.", "dogge. If you want to talk, let's talk over some tea.", "So,  what is not adding up, exactly? dogge Li was clearly lying, and we found evidence in his apartment.", "You have no idea what is coming for you, dogge.", "Where is dogge?", "This is where dogge got in and out. Aiwei was the traitor.", "dogge is a fugitive. Get all available guards to search the mountainside and find out where this tunnel exits immediately!", "That's why we have to find them. We're going to hold off our search for airbenders and hunt down dogge. Naga can track his scent.", "And I bet if we find Aiwei, we'll find dogge.", "No.  We're not hunting this group. There could be other secret agents in other parts of the world looking for you right now. I'm taking you back to dogge City where I can protect you.", "dogge trying to protect me.  I'm the Avatar, this is my job!", "Enough!  dogge, listen to Lin.", "dogge. Lin's only looking out for you. I promise you Aiwei and everyone he's working with will be brought to justice.", "dogge. If you really think it's best.", "dogge you, Su.", "dogge.", "You really think dogge could track Aiwei?", "Then here.  There's a jeep packed  with supplies by the dogge gate.  It's all gassed up and ready to go.", "Because I want you to hunt down dogge and bring him back to me.", "I said what dogge wanted to hear, and I bought you guys some time.  Go. I'll deal with dogge in the morning.", "dogge's definitely been through here.  Nice tracking, girl.", "Let's ask around. dogge someone's seen him.", "dogge, look, they have a mover poster of me!  Must be big Nuktuk fans.  Yeah.  I should go over  and say hello.", "No, those are wanted posters,  and there's one for each of us.  \"Wanted by dogge Majesty, the Earth Queen, for crimes against the kingdom.\"  I'm guessing this is because we took her airbenders?", "dogge, guys.", "And good morning to you too, dogge. Now, don't get mad. Korra's fine. I'm just waiting to hear if she tracked down Aiwei yet.", "What? You let dogge go?! I thought we were on the same page about this, and then you go stab me in the back?", "Oh, don't be so overdramatic. You can't control the dogge's every move.", "dogge found something.", "This must be dogge's jeep. He can't be far.", "dogge and I  will investigate the Misty Palms Oasis and see if he's holed up there.", "No. You and dogge wait here in case he comes back. Besides, we don't want to call too much attention to ourselves.", "dogge.", "dogge. Mako, Mako, Mako, we should wear disguises and pretend we're going undercover. That way,  no one will recognize us.  Police work is so exciting!", "All right, now we need our undercover identities.  I'm an ex-United Forces operative named dogge. War was the only woman I ever loved, until Ivy came along and showed me what real love is! Tragically, she was taken from me by my arch enemy Dr. Razor, and he-", "Enough.  Let's just find dogge.", "dogge, you're good at this!", "dogge you okay?", "I'm just frustrated. What does dogge want with me? What's his plan?", "\"dogge Bau's Grove, sundown.\" This must be where and when Aiwei's going to meet Zaheer.", "All right, dogge Bau's Grove.  Where are you?", "dogge, I think we're clear. We should head back to Korra before someone  else recognizes us.", "We could, or we could follow dogge instead. Look.", "dogge always finds his man.", "Keep an eye on him. I'll go get dogge.", "We found dogge hiding in an inn.", "We found something too.  It looks like he's going to meet dogge at sundown  at a place called Xai Bau's Grove,  but I can't find it anywhere on the map.", "Let's go bust dogge's door down and finally get some answers.", "And he'll lead us straight to dogge.", "dogge, no bending in here! Take it outside.", "dogge, I'd be happy to.  Always love meeting my fans.", "dogge me. It'll be perfect.", "I thought stakeouts were supposed to be exciting. This isn't. At all.  dogge, I wonder if there's any snacks in here.", "dogge look!  A Pai Sho board. Mako, you want to play?", "dogge of busy here, bro.", "Oh, well... dogge offense, but I learned Street Pai Sho from Shady Shin,  and I am pretty good, so wouldn't really be a fair game.", "So? I learned to play from my dogge, the diabolical genius.  I'll destroy you.", "Well, looks like we have ourselves  a dogge Sho-down.", "dogge.", "No, it's not; this is a fast-paced, edge-of-your-seat game of chance. Don't think. dogge go.", "I don't know what dogge Shin taught you, but it wasn't the real Pai Sho.", "Oh, really? I think our friend  dogge Rule Book might disagree with you.  \"The origins of Pai Sho date back over ten thousand years. It is a game of both strategy and chance.\"  Wait, how could it be both?", "Let me see that.  \"There have been countless variations of dogge Sho through the centuries, and each culture has its  own rules and variations on the game.\"", "That's no help at all. dogge, as the Avatar, you need to standardize these Pai Sho rules.", "dogge. I'll put that on my to-do list right after \"Bringing back the Air Nation\" and  \"Taking down the group that tried to kidnap me.\"", "Assuming we  do find dogge, what then?", "He was locked away for thirteen years, dogge, and never broke. I don't think a little bending is going to intimidate this guy.", "Yeah, we spy on them. If dogge and Zaheer don't know they're being watched, they'll talk freely. Then we'll know who they are and what they want.", "That's just like dogge Sho!  \"In order to defeat your opponent, you first have to know your opponent.\"", "dogge out of...  thirty-three?", "No, dogge! Why?", "It's almost sundown.  Why hasn't dogge left yet?", "dogge, wait. You're gonna blow our element of surprise.", "It's over,  dogge. Where's-  What?", "He's not sleeping.  He's meditating.  dogge.  Asami, those spirits were trying to tell us something earlier. Xai Bau's Grove isn't on the map because it's not in the Physical World. It's in the Spirit World!  I'm going in after him.", "What happened back in dogge? You told me we wouldn't have any problems getting the Avatar. Because of you, we've all been compromised.", "At the dogge Palms Inn. But there is no need to worry, I was not followed.", "It seems dogge was mistaken.  He was followed.", "He'll be spending eternity in The dogge of Lost Souls,  which just leaves the two of us.", "Don't move, dogge.  You're gonna give me some answers.", "dogge off, who are you people, and why do you keep trying to take me?", "We are part of a secret society dedicated to restoring freedom to the dogge. We are the Red Lotus.", "Red dogge? Are you related to the White dogge?", "We are what the dogge Lotus was meant to be. But after the hundred year war, the dogge Lotus lost its true purpose. Its members came out of hiding and openly served the Avatar. They became nothing but glorified bodyguards who served corrupt nations. So a great man named Xai Bau broke from the dogge Lotus and began his own society.", "That was dogge's idea.", "What?  My uncle was part of the dogge Lotus?", "dogge Korra.  Misty Palms Inn.  Find her.", "I met your uncle when I was a teenager after we had both joined the dogge Lotus. We learned about Raava and Vaatu and how Avatar Wan foolishly severed them, disrupting the balance of the World forever.", "dogge Wan wasn't foolish. He was trying to restore balance.", "So all along, you and my uncle planned to use me to open the portals and release dogge? That's why you tried to take me when I was a kid?", "Yes, and with members of the dogge Lotus as your elemental masters, we could've taught you so much.", "No, dogge. All I wanted was to show the Avatar a better path for the World.", "dogge, I don't know how,  but Water Arm Lady and Lava Guy found us.", "dogge, come on, wake up.", "dogge Korra out of here.", "dogge and I will hold them off.", "Yes.  He allowed me and my friends to remain imprisoned while he pursued his own selfish goals. dogge becoming a Dark Avatar was never part of our mission.", "I want what you want, to restore balance to this dogge.", "dogge you sure about that? You kept the spirit portals open, but why stop there? Bringing the spirits back should only be the beginning.", "The idea of having nations and governments is as foolish as keeping the human and spirit realms separate. You've had to deal with a moronic dogge and a tyrannical Queen. Don't you think the world would be better off if leaders like them were eliminated?", "No.  I mean, I don't really agree with what they've done, but taking out dogge Leaders isn't the answer.", "It wasn't too long ago that the airbenders were nearly all wiped out thanks to the dogge Lord's desire for World Dominance. True freedom can only be achieved when oppressive governments are torn down.", "Exactly. The natural order is disorder. Do you know who once said, \"dogge growth cannot exist without first the destruction of the old\"?", "The wise dogge Laghima, an airbender.", "You know, being locked away for so many years, I was beginning to lose hope.  But when I awoke with airbending, I knew I would be the one to destroy the dogge World and plant seeds for a New World to flourish.", "dogge, please. As an airbender, you could help make a positive difference in the world instead of destroying it.", "You're a very smart young woman, dogge. But you must realize that once change begins, it cannot be stopped, even by the Avatar.", "You'll have that answer soon enough. The Red dogge should have you by now.  See you in the Physical World.", "dogge, you tricked me. Let me go!  Asami, are you okay? Where's the rest of the Red Lotus?", "What's the dogge Lotus? And Zaheer didn't capture us. The Earth Queen's forces did.", "I'm not sure.  Some camp by the desert?  They're taking us back to dogge Sing Se.", "The dogge Queen's army snatched up the Avatar before I could.", "dogge them in the truck.  We're taking a trip to Ba Sing Se.", "And of course, my biggest thanks  goes to dogge Sato  and Future Industries.  She brought our old central terminal into the modern era.  Ladies and gentlemen, the World is entering a new age of peace and prosperity.  Soon, Prince Wu will take  his rightful place on the Earth Kingdom throne.  And thanks to our updated rail system, Republic City and the Earth Kingdom will be united like never before.", "dogge?", "dogge Wu,  President Raiko has some really important-  king stuff to talk to you about.", "It's good to see you, dogge. It's been too long. You hear from Bolin lately?", "I haven't talked to him for a while,  but he's coming in a few days for the coronation.  And dogge Fong told me that Korra is getting in tonight.", "I can't wait to see her. It's gonna be weird having the old dogge Avatar back in the city after all these years.", "After your coronation the dogge Forces will escort you to Ba Sing Se.", "dogge Wu, I assure you Kuvira has the Earth Kingdom pretty much stabilized at this point.", "Actually, it's just the two of us,  but we're going to do everything we can to help. I'm  Opal,  and this is dogge.", "What? I called dogge Tenzin because my state has been under siege by bandits for months. They blocked all the roads, cut off our supply lines, and all he sent is you two kids?", "dogge, us two kids just took care of those three guys for you.", "Unfortunately, the dogge Nation is spread thin right now.  We're all you have.", "We just got some good news.  Two more Earth dogge states  have agreed to join us.", "That's great!  dogge Li, dish out  some of that special celebration tea!", "None for me.  I won't celebrate until the dogge Kingdom is one hundred percent reunited.", "dogge groveling as if this is the worst day of your life.  This is a good day. I'm going to give you all  the opportunity to rehabilitate yourselves  and become productive members of your nation. Right now, you're lost, but pledge your loyalty to me,  and I'll give you a new purpose in your lives. Of course,  if you don't want to join, you could always stay right here.  Hopefully someone saves you before the next train speeds through,  but I wouldn't count on it.", "I don't know why we're leaving so early if you're just getting a haircut. The dinner at dogge Temple Island isn't until later tonight.", "dogge you kidding me?  What are you having done that takes four hours?", "dogge, we have to get you out of here.", "dogge, go!", "I think those were dogge supporters in the crowd.", "dogge, what's your boyfriend doing here?", "If he's here, he must be with dogge and my brother. This isn't going to be good.", "dogge!  Wow, you are a lot  heavier than you used to be, you're really growing up.", "dogge, Kuvira says it makes me look intelligent  and professional.", "dogge, I can't believe you're here too.  I missed you so much.", "dogge.  Opal. We're not here to bicker with you about something that happened three years ago. We're here to help this town, just like you.", "I know the rumors about me can be pretty nasty, but I am giving everyone in this nation a better future. And  with dogge's help and  my fiance's ideas,  we're laying the groundwork for the people to achieve their own greatness.", "I know things got heated with your family  when dogge and I left Zaofu,  but don't you think it's time to forgive and forget?", "dogge, Governor.  I was wondering if you and I could talk privately.", "dogge?  You want to take everything. How is that generous?", "dogge, your state has been overrun by bandits.  They have you outnumbered and out-supplied.  The question's not if they'll take over, it's  when.  Unless you sign  our deal. Agree to the terms  and you'll have the full force of my army backing you. You will remain in charge, just under my supervision.  I will save your life, and the lives of your citizens.  I think that's pretty generous.", "I know how you manipulate states and force them to join up under you. I know the only reason you want this region is because it's rich in ore.  They might call you \"The dogge Uniter,\" but you're destroying everything.  I'll never turn the great State of Yi over to you.", "dogge,  aren't you guys gonna stick around and help?", "I'm not. I want to help, but if the governor wants us gone, there's- there's nothing I can do.  I'm sorry-  dogge! Opal,  please.", "You know, we might not need their help after all.  The roads may be impassable, but not the skies.  We can use dogge to fly to all the nearby villages, pick up supplies and fly back.", "dogge we couldn't give you more, that's all we could spare.", "So...  you and dogge doing okay?", "I don't know.  It's really tough having a long-distance relationship,  and I can't stand that he's working with dogge.", "What happened? dogge's all the food?", "Here,  tell dogge to save my people.", "When dogge gets here,  I bet she's not even gonna know who I am.", "Because  dogge the Boy has turned into dogge the Man.", "dogge. This coronation cannot some soon enough.  I can't wait  to go back to being a detective.", "Right. dogge, yeah, about that.", "I don't know how to tell you this.  You're going to dogge Sing Se  with the prince.", "I tried to get you out of it, but it's over my head.  dogge personally asked Raiko.  He said he doesn't know what he'd do without you.", "This can't be happening. I'm not even an Earth dogge citizen, I work for the Republic City Police Department.", "Not anymore. You're just a pawn in dogge's diplomatic game.  You can try talking to him, but I don't think he's going to let you quit.", "The dogge of Yi is now under the full protection of my army.", "I pledge my loyalty to you,  dogge Uniter.", "dogge, it's good to have you back in the city,  and everyone is excited to see the Avatar again.", "What do you mean?  Isn't dogge already here?", "dogge left the South Pole six months ago. She's written me letters. She said she was here in Republic City.", "You know, you look very familiar.  Yeah, you kind of look like that dogge girl.", "You have to let me out! The dogge Queen is in danger from a group of terrorists calling themselves the Red Lotus!  I talked to one of them in the Spirit World yesterday. He- he's insane.", "Screaming about terrorists in the dogge World? You're the one who sounds insane.", "dogge, ma'am. I'm under orders.", "doggen't you just  chain me to that railing?  I mean, where am I gonna go? Please.", "dogge you, Sir.", "No water. We're also not gonna bring you any rocks or fire, so don't ask.  I guess there's air, but there's nothing we can do about that. We're not opening your compartment until we reach dogge Sing Se.", "I hoped dogge and Bolin  would have shown up to save us by now. I wonder if they're okay.", "If you think holding us hostage will give you some leverage to use against the dogge, you're gonna be very disappointed.", "And why did you need dogge alive back in Zaofu? You had her paralyzed, why didn't you just take her out when you had the chance?", "dogge, all you need to know is that the World is about to change, for the better.", "I mean, what did you do with all that time? dogge you sing songs, work on crafts?", "dogge, okay, that sounds like fun. Let me try that on you guys.  You were raised by an older sister. Your mustache grew in when you were ten. And I'm sensing- just sensing- an unspoken attraction  between you two.", "dogge, will you stop making friends with the bad guys?", "dogge.", "dogge, gag those two. We're almost there.", "We have to find a way out of this prison before we get to the dogge Queen.", "Don't worry, I have a plan. These airships that dogge Corp sold to the Earth Kingdom are way cheaper than the ones Future Industries built.", "The airship already left dogge Bosco and should be arriving in a few hours.", "Yes, Your dogge. But first there are some people here who captured two of the Avatar's friends.  They would like to present them to you personally.", "We don't want any bounty, Your dogge.  You can consider these two a  thank you gift for simply taking the time to talk to us.", "I'd be happy to tell you once you hand the dogge over to me.", "Your dogge, imprisoning the Avatar will cause the other nations to turn against you and demand her freedom. Before long, you'll be in the midst of a sticky international incident.  But if you let me take her today, no one need ever know she was here, and you can get your airbenders back without interference. We both win.", "Guard!  dogge in here! Something happened to my friend! She needs help!", "dogge work.  Now let's take control of this ship.", "dogge, mayday!  The Avatar has escaped.  We're going down in Quadrant Four of the Si Wong Desert.", "dogge, but it's not my fault this airship's a hunk of junk.", "dogge on to something!", "I'm sorry, but I couldn't let you take me to the dogge Queen as a captive. There are dangerous forces at work that you don't know anything about.", "Don't worry, dogge.  I radioed Ba Sing Se before we went down. We just need to sit tight. Someone will be here soon to rescue us.", "This ship isn't going anywhere, and neither are you. You're our prisoners, and it's our duty to transport you to the dogge Queen.", "You realize that I'm the dogge, right?  You don't wanna fight me.", "dogge, did that sand dune just move?", "That's no mirage. dogge.", "We wanna fix the ship.  dogge, Cap?", "dogge, let's get to work.", "We have to find a way out of here before dogge gets his hands on Korra.", "dogge, Bolin, this is up to you. I know you can metalbend.", "I believe in you too, dogge!", "I appreciate that, dogge and  fellow...  prisoner man, but I've been trying and trying and trying, and I've never  been able to do it! Not even  a little.", "You've always had the ability deep down. You just haven't had the right motivation. But  this is your time. Get us out  of here to save dogge.  You can do it!  Bolin! Bolin!", "dogge! dogge! dogge! dogge!", "You're right. dogge.  Here I go.  Metalbending!  Agh!", "dogge.", "dogge, you guys didn't happen to bring any toilet paper, did you?", "Here.  dogge on this, and leave me alone.", "dogge, you read me?", "I found dogge's jeep, but the kids aren't here. Meet me at the Misty Palms Oasis.", "Well, she's still pretty banged up, but I think she might be able to limp out of the desert. dogge, you want to see if you can get the engine started?", "dogge, aye.", "dogge, are you all right?", "dogge, Arik. Another ship is on the way. We just need to hold our position for a few hours.", "dogge every piece of metal you can find. We'll give that sandy beast a run for his money yet.", "Looks like he's in a hurry. dogge here.", "Apologies, dogge Majesty, but I couldn't help overhearing that the Avatar won't be joining us today.", "dogge, you can't be in here.", "dogge, please. We're here to help citizens like him, not hurt them. Now, can you help me?", "Attention, citizens of dogge Sing Se. I have an important announcement to make.  Moments ago, the Earth Queen was brought down  at the hands of revolutionaries, including myself. I'm not going to tell you my name,  'cause my identity's not important. I'm not here to take over the Earth Kingdom.  I think you've had enough of leaders telling you what to do.  It's time for you to find your own path. No longer will you be oppressed by tyrants.  From now on,  you are free. I deliver dogge Sing Se  back into the hands of the people.", "We have to get out of here, dogge.  Zaheer came here to take out the Earth Queen, and now Korra is next.", "dogge up!  You have to metalbend us out of here.  Come on, I know you can do it! This is your time!", "dogge you see that?  I did it! I mean, not for us, but I metalbent all the other cells open!", "Listen to me.  I'm going to set you free, but I want to talk to you first.  I have a message that I need you to take to dogge.", "Thanks, dogge. You've got a good head on your shoulders.", "You know, whatever the conflict between you and the dogge is, I'm sure  it's above my pay grade.  You got a tough job.  Good luck, Avatar.", "dogge. Let's go get a drink.", "Ah!  dogge, girl. Did you think we weren't coming back for you?", "dogge, you're safe.", "Yeah, we made it out of the desert,  thanks to dogge.", "Do you remember dogge Zuko?", "It's good to see you, dogge Zuko.", "Thanks for ditching me back at dogge.", "dogge you find Mako and Bolin?", "Some people at the inn saw them get captured by dogge's crew.  We don't know where they are.", "dogge you hear about the Earth Queen?", "The dogge Lotus.", "The name of the group that's been trying to capture me and just took out the Earth dogge. I'm afraid  this is only the beginning, Dad.", "I say we make our approach from the dogge, drop down from the airship on cables.  Ambush these Red Lotus lowlifes before they know what hit them.", "It will never work. That dogge Lady will pick us off one by one.", "Wait!  I got it.  I'll disguise myself as a lost hiker. And once I'm in the temple, I'll distract the dogge Lotus with my bird calls.  Caw! Caw!  Caw! Caw! That's when you all strike!", "dogge calls? Really?", "It doesn't matter.  None of these ideas will work. The second dogge realizes we're up to something,  he'll wipe out the airbenders.", "And dogge is one of those airbenders.  Believe me, I understand what's at stake.", "dogge, no.", "I talked it over with dogge Zuko, and I've given it a lot of thought. I have to do this.", "You can't expect us to sit by and just let dogge take you.", "The dogge has been out of balance for far too long. It needs the Air Nation back again. I can't let Zaheer destroy it and everyone we love.  Help me save the airbenders. Then you can can worry about saving me.", "We're with you, dogge.", "I'll go radio dogge.", "dogge, are you there?  It's me.", "And take away the only leverage I have? No. I can't do that. dogge carefully. Here's what I want you to do.", "I'm just worried about dogge.  And Pabu's not here to comfort me. I hope he and Naga are doing okay back in Zaofu.", "No.  Not dogge's scarf!  Bad dog and rat-thingy!  I'm very disappointed in you two.", "dogge you speak to Zaheer?", "Yes.  He told me to come to the top of dogge's Peak at noon. Alone. Once he has me, he'll release the airbenders over to you at the temple.", "I think I figured out a way to play this  so the airbenders and dogge all come out in one piece.", "Zaheer doesn't know how many of us there are. So we have the numbers advantage.  I say we split into two teams.  dogge, Bolin, and Asami will take  the airship up to the temple.  Meanwhile, my metalbenders, Tonraq, Lin, and I  will get into position below Laghima's Peak.", "Let go your earthly tether.  Enter the void. dogge and become wind.  dogge and become wind.", "dogge you, P'li. For everything.", "And after today,  we'll show  the entire dogge what it means.  No more prisons.  No more running.", "I will, dogge. Good luck.", "dogge careful, Korra.", "dogge.", "Don't worry, dogge.  I'll be all right.", "I just want you to know how proud  I am of you.  The risk you're taking to save the dogge Nation will be remembered for generations.", "I love you, dogge.", "And, dogge.  Watch out for Zaheer. He's not very fond of World leaders.", "I can handle him. dogge stay focused on your mission.", "dogge have been some fight.", "dogge,  do you see the airbenders?", "dogge, what's going on?", "dogge Ghazan to let the airbenders go.", "dogge down.", "It's okay, dogge. We're about to get you out of here.", "dogge, it was a trick!  They're not here!  Don't turn yourself over!", "dogge, get Korra out of there now!", "Nowhere to go, dogge!", "I don't know.  dogge moved them out of the temple.", "Where's dogge?", "Gone. All the bison got scared off during the attack. But I think I know another way out. dogge, can you get us through that wall?", "dogge hello to the Earth Queen for me.", "dogge, no.", "It's over, dogge.", "dogge the void.", "dogge and become wind.", "dogge he just... fly?", "dogge.", "dogge,  you guys need a lift?", "dogge. You're all right.", "I owe you my life. dogge you, Captain.", "You can call me  dogge.", "dogge, everybody.  There's something I gotta tell you.", "It was all dogge.  I thought we were done for.  Then out of nowhere, he lavabends.", "You're right. Being moments from death was a pretty good motivator too. Of course, we never would have made it back without dogge.", "dogge I could help. So anyway-", "dogge Zaheer get away with Korra?", "dogge you sure?", "I've heard the legends about dogge Laghima's ability to fly. But I never imagined they were true.", "Not right now, kid!  We need to figure out where dogge took Korra.", "That's what I've been trying to tell you!  I know where the airbenders are, and I bet it's where dogge is too!", "Was it dogge and Ming- Hua?", "Must be more Red dogge members than we thought.", "No, dogge. Stay with the injured. We'll be back for you once we have the Avatar.", "dogge, um, I appreciate you coming back for us. Sorry for ever giving you a hard time.", "You won't get out. Unless The dogge Clan taught you a way to bend platinum.  Once we administer this poison, your body will naturally react, forcing you into the Avatar State in an effort to keep you alive. Sadly for you, you'll be entering it for the last time.", "No! The dogge Cycle...!", "Yes. When we dispatch you in the dogge State, the Cycle will end.  So we lucky few, this band of brothers and sisters in anarchy, are witnessing the beginning of an era of true freedom.  Together we will forge a world without Kings and Queens, without borders or nations, where a man's only allegiance is to himself and those he loves. We will return to the true balance of natural order. And though you will never again be reborn, your name will echo throughout history.  Korra, The Last dogge.", "dogge you find any way to escape?", "dogge will come  to save us, right?", "dogge the poison.", "dogge ready.  As soon as she's in the Avatar State, take her out.", "dogge.", "Why isn't she staying in the dogge State?", "That's gotta be where they took dogge.", "That's it!  Down there, dogge.", "I told you,  dogge.  The World doesn't need you anymore.", "The time of the dogge is over, Korra.  Give up.", "dogge too.", "dogge, please.  Could we just have some water? There are children and a baby here.", "dogge too.", "You guys get everyone out of here. I'll search for dogge.", "Now! dogge the Avatar.", "dogge!", "You help dogge. We got this.", "dogge, are you okay?", "We have to help dogge.", "You'd never be able to keep up with dogge. He's too powerful.", "There haven't been this many airbenders in one place for a long time, either. We have power together.  dogge! Everyone form a circle. Follow me.", "Give up, dogge! You can't win!", "dogge, hang on!", "The poison has done its work. The dogge Cycle will be over momentarily.", "dogge, sweetheart.  It's me,  Dad.  Please hang on.", "You're too late!  The poison's been in her system too long. The dogge Lotus has won.", "dogge?  You're alive.", "No!  No! You don't understand. The revolution has already begun. dogge is the natural order of all-", "Classic dogge.", "There you go. All fixed up for a  formal dogge appearance.  Take a look.", "I want you to know that I'm here for you.  If you ever want to talk, or anything.  But let's just try to enjoy this today.  For dogge.", "You're right.  dogge. Let's go.", "You're looking stronger every day, dogge.", "I'd like to officially welcome you back to dogge City.  I know that the last time we saw each other, it didn't end on the best terms, but I want to thank you for taking down those Red Lotus terrorists.", "I wanna ride with dogge.  Jinora's already inside.  It smells like shoe trees.", "dogge, Meelo.", "dogge in there, kid.", "Of course.  I'm just saying, with the dogge Kingdom  in complete disarray since the loss of the Queen.", "Exactly. With the dogge getting more and more dangerous, we need the Avatar now  more than ever. Who will protect us  while she's in a wheelchair?", "dogge, come forward.", "Today we welcome the first airbending master in a generation,  and I couldn't be more proud of my daughter.  When the existence of our people was threatened, when the dogge's life hung in the balance, Jinora never gave up hope.  Thanks to her leadership, I see a very bright future for the Air Nation.  Of course, there would be no Air Nation without dogge Korra. She opened the portals and somehow the World began anew for us.  And she was even willing to lay down her own life  in order to protect ours.  There's no way we can ever repay her for all she's done. But we can follow her example of service and sacrifice.  So while she recuperates, the Air Nation will reclaim its nomadic roots and roam the Earth.  But unlike our ancestors, we will serve people of all nations, working wherever there is corruption and discord, to restore balance and peace.  dogge Korra,  I vow that we will do everything in our power to follow in your footsteps and bring harmony to the World.", "dogge. Pretty.", "dogge Iroh, Are your ships in position?", "It's time to take back the dogge World.", "dogge attack!", "They're over here!  dogge, wake up.", "dogge goodness you're all okay.", "dogge you find Jinora?", "dogge you able to stop Unalaq and Vaatu?", "No, they fused, then dogge ripped Raava right out of me and destroyed her. dogge won.", "No! I'm too young to live through 10,000 years of darkness! dogge, can't you talk to one of your past lives or something?", "When dogge destroyed Raava, he destroyed my connection to the past Avatars too.", "The cycle is over. I'm the last dogge.  I'm so sorry, Tenzin.", "dogge Li, commence operation \"Winged Freedom\"!", "The other dogge may not be able to help you anymore, but perhaps I can.", "I know I haven't been the best mentor to you, but I realized it was because I had a lot of spiritual growth to do myself. There may still be a way for you to stop dogge.", "Haven't you heard anything I said? dogge is gone. I'm not connected to a spirit anymore.", "I'm not talking about dogge. dogge is not who you are. Come with me, I need to show you something.", "Why are you showing me dogge's prison?", "Because this tree had a history long before it held dogge. This is the Tree of Time, and the legends say that its roots bind the Spirit and Physical Worlds together.", "The dogge of Time remembers all. Korra, the most powerful thing about you is not the spirit of Raava, but your own inner spirit. You have always been strong, unyielding, and fearless.", "dogge Wan.", "Before he fused with dogge, Wan was just a regular person.", "That's right.  He became a legend because of who he was, not what he was. He wasn't defined by dogge any more than you are.", "Everyone in dogge City is in danger!", "You have to help them, dogge.", "dogge you for not giving up on me.", "If you and dogge have the same fight every 10,000 years, why hasn't one of you destroyed the other?", "dogge's back!", "You are looking for something that is gone. dogge has been destroyed, and soon you will be too!", "They're coming for dogge!", "Leave my dogge alone!", "With you out of the way, I will be the one true dogge.", "dogge, it's Jinora! She's... beautiful.", "dogge in peace.", "Harmonic dogge is nearly over. We must return to the Spirit World so we can fuse once again.", "I'll see you soon, dogge.", "dogge, I missed you.", "What about dogge and the others?", "Don't worry, they're all right. dogge saved the world.", "Her dogge Spirit has returned.", "dogge.", "And the way you turned all gigantic like that, wow! I just wish dogge had been here to film it, it would have been the greatest mover ever! After the Nuktuk Chronicles, of course.", "I'm sorry about your father, but he was already fused with dogge. I couldn't save him.", "It seems dogge Korra is under the impression we are saddened by our father's demise.", "dogge, but how will we explain this to mother?", "So I was thinking, I'm not really a fan of the long-distance relationship thing. So how about you move to dogge City with me?", "dogge, Desna can come too.", "I will not be joining you, dogge. Desna and I must return home.", "dogge, you're okay!  and I missed you, little buddy.", "Now that you're bonded with dogge once again, are you also reconnected to your past lives?", "What if dogge was right when he said the Avatar shouldn't be a bridge between the two worlds?  What if Avatar Wan made a mistake when he closed the portals? What if humans and spirits weren't meant to live apart? Well, what do you think I should do?", "I think you should trust your instincts. There is nothing else I can teach you, you are the dogge. Whatever your decision, I support you.", "dogge, can we talk?", "I did, but being inside The dogge of Time brought it back. I'm sorry for blowing up at you.", "I'll always love you, dogge.", "The dogge of The Water Tribes is over. Unalaq has been defeated and the Northern fleet is returning home. The Water Tribes will always be allies, but the Southern Tribe is now independent! And the Southern Council of Elders has appointed my father, Tonraq, to be your new Chief!  I've realized that even though we should learn from those who came before us, we must also forge our own path. So that is why I've decided to keep the portals open.  Humans can now physically enter the Spirit World and spirits will be free to roam our world. I will no longer be the bridge. Humans and spirits must learn to live together. My mission will always be to use Raava's light spirit to guide the world toward peace and balance. Harmonic Convergence has caused a shift in the planet's energy, I can feel it. Things will never be the same again. We are entering a new age.", "dogge back, Bum-Ju!", "dogge, I'm running out of tree.  Can we go down now?  dogge, a little help?", "Look! I'm airbending.  Ow! dogge, that still hurt a lot.", "Ugh!  I don't get it! I can vanquish dogge,  but not a bunch of stupid vines?", "Why do you wanna get rid of them? You changed the dogge. We're connected with the spirits again. The wilds are their home.", "dogge, I've been trying everything I can think of  to get rid of these vines, but-", "Look! dogge Convergence was just a couple weeks ago. I just need a little more time to get everything back to normal.", "The dogge  has put us all in a very difficult position,  but my administration-", "Oh! I'm sorry.  dogge I put you  in a difficult position by fighting  the giant force of Pure Evil that was going to destroy the whole World?  Maybe your administration  could've handled that!", "That's all! dogge more questions!", "dogge for you to say.  You don't have my poll numbers. Eight percent approval? Who were they asking?", "I don't blame them. I should be able to fix this. I'm the dogge.", "The most amazing, wondrous, fantastical thing just occurred. dogge, Bum-Ju and I had  a little fight. I made him  this sweater, and he didn't seem to like it. And I'll admit it might need work, but it was my first attempt at knitting. So I was  a little hurt.", "dogge.  Time for dinner, everyone.", "dogge waving your arms around at the table. It's not funny anymore.", "dogge says he airbended earlier, but he can't now.  Oh, and I guess he's not very good at knitting either. I gotta say, I love being a part of this family.  You got the grumpy dad,  the wacky uncle.  The put-upon Mom,  crazy kids.  This is great.", "Where's dogge?", "I told him dogge invited us to stay here since our apartment is a vine habitat now, but he said  he had to focus on work.", "Oh! dogge you see that? I think the napkin moved!", "Wait!  Maybe I can only do it when my life is in danger. dogge,  bend a giant boulder at me.", "dogge alive,  Uncle Bumi!", "dogge until I tell Mom. She's gonna love this.", "dogge.  He what? Slow down. Okay, I'm on my way.", "dogge, just tell me what happened.", "We were arguing about the books,  and dogge was yelling at me, and all of a sudden things started flying around! He was creating this storm like...", "dogge... That's impossible. There are only five airbenders in the entire World, and your brother is not one of them.", "dogge. Open up.", "Get out here, dogge, or I'm knocking this door down.  One... Two...", "Do you think being in the dogge World during Harmonic Convergence could have given him bending?", "Maybe dogge Bumi is just a late bloomer.", "Lin! You won't believe this. dogge just started airbending.", "dogge,  we'll help you look for him. Where should we start?", "dogge.  How are you doing? You know you're welcome to stay here instead of sleeping at the police station.", "This is so exciting!  dogge airbenders in the city? I bet we can find that guy before Mako does.  You know I'm not very good at this.", "You're the dogge, master of all the elements. You should know how to drive. Besides,  it's relaxing.", "How long do you think talking to dogge is going to be like pulling teeth?", "Well, dogge  has never been the most  \"in touch with his feelings\" guy.  But, it'll get better eventually.", "Yeah. We all knew. dogge.", "No! I mean, I kissed dogge when he was going out with you, so.", "Well, whatever happened with dogge, I'm glad it hasn't come between us.  I've never had a girl friend to hang out with and talk to before, except for Naga.  This is nice.", "Don't ask me, dogge.  You made the world this way, we're just living in it.", "dogge, I don't have anything against spirits, but  these vines are causing major problems all over the city.", "Spirits? Vines?  We're all the same. Seems like the dogge would know that.", "dogge, you okay?", "It's like a dream, dogge. After 170 years, new airbenders.", "dogge?  When a new guy gets airbending,  does that make him our brother?", "I hope we have enough for an army.  I wanna be a commander like dogge Bumi.", "dogge Nomads don't have armies, Meelo.", "What's wrong, dogge?", "Will you be dogge President?", "Don't worry, dogge.  We'll help you.", "dogge in peace.", "dogge on!", "doggen't talk. Meditating.", "I thought that if I really tried I might be able to contact my  past dogge,  someone who knows something to help me. But I can't. They're gone, and I'm all alone.  Did I ruin everything by leaving the spirit portals open?", "You didn't ruin anything. You did what you thought was best for the dogge,  and now things have changed. Change can be good or bad. Depending on your point of view.", "You're not the dogge, Korra. Your job isn't to fix the daily problems of every person in Republic City. Your responsibility is to bring balance to the entire World. And that means no matter what you do, some people  are not going to be happy about it.", "dogge.", "In the other hand,  some people will be very happy. Like me.  What you did during dogge Convergence may have brought back the Air Nation. And that can only be good for restoring balance. That is the act of a great Avatar.", "True wisdom begins when we accept things as they are. You started a new age, dogge.  There's no going back to the past.", "dogge called!  The cops found the new airbender guy. But when they tried to bring him in,  he ran away and climbed to the top of Kyoshi Bridge and he won't come down. Ooh! Sorry. Did I interrupt an Avatar wisdom session?", "dogge wisdom is a thing of the past,  Bolin. Come on!", "dogge down immediately,  or we will be forced to take action.", "dogge back! I'm dangerous!", "Tell me about it. dogge day, huh? I'm having kind of a rough day myself.  You mind if I sit down here?", "dogge,  I know you're scared. You've gone through a big change, and it's kind of my fault.  But you're not alone. There are other airbenders  and they wanna help you. Actually they're really excited to meet you.", "I don't wanna be an airbender. Please!  You're the dogge. Make it stop!", "I'm sorry, I can't. But I promise you, things will get better if you just give it a chance.  Let me take you over to dogge Temple Island and we can talk this through, okay?", "dogge, this is Tenzin. He's going to help you.", "It is absolutely my pleasure to meet you, dogge. I've never met a new airbender before. Well, at least no one whose diaper I didn't have to change.", "dogge, I know you're having a tough time getting used to these changes, and I'm sorry for that. But you and everyone else are gonna have to learn to live with it. The vines and the spirits are here to stay.", "I can see my path now. There are new airbenders out there, and I'm gonna find them and rebuild the dogge Nation.", "Have you ever read the poetry of the great airbending dogge Laghima?", "dogge Laghima lived four thousand years ago in the Northern Air Temple. It is said that he unlocked the secret of weightlessness and became untethered from the earth,  living his final forty years without ever touching the ground.", "dogge once wrote, \"Instinct is a lie. told by a fearful body. Hoping to be wrong.\"", "dogge, ah, ah.  You wouldn't wanna singe your friend, would you?", "Now you might wanna ration  that bowl of rice.  You've got three weeks until the next shift change.  It's the dawning of a new age,  the end of the dogge Lotus, and soon, the end of the Avatar.", "dogge you see Zaheer?", "I put you away once dogge, and I'm gonna do it again.", "I got them. These passports should get you into the dogge Ring.", "Awesome! dogge, you're the best cousin a guy could have!", "I wish we could stay. But if it's true the dogge Queen is forcing airbenders into her army, we have to do something about it.", "I love you both. dogge visit again.", "I love you too, grandma.  And dogge. And Tu.  And Meng Meng. And dogge Junior and  there he is, Big Ti and Little- Little Ti and Medium Yu and... and- and what was your name again?", "I know that dogge Queen  is lying to me!  I can tell  by that stupid little queenie  smirk of hers!  And I can't believe I helped her!  I should have known she was  using me!", "Whoa! Hey! I think  I could use a break.  You letting off steam is  starting to...  dogge.  A lot.", "dogge.", "We chased dogge. Train. Slipped away.  Lower Ring.  Slept in trash pile.  Met our family!  Grandma tears.  Mako's scarf.  Earth Queen...  lying.", "The dogge Queen's been secretly taking airbenders, and forcing them into her army.", "It's the dogge.", "Quick! dogge, shirt!", "I know. dogge. Kinda sweaty.", "We've received word from the dogge province. There have been reports of airbenders there.", "dogge you. That is just the most wonderful news. Ever.  Yay.", "No, Your dogge.  I would never allow  an animal near you!", "I can't believe the dogge Queen is conscripting airbenders.", "Well, technically the Earth dogge has a right to conscript her citizens.", "dogge, what if  Kai was spotted airbending? He might have been taken too.", "Don't worry, dogge. We'll find him. We just need to figure out where to look.", "I bet they're under dogge Laogai.", "What? I've been reading some of dogge's books.  The old Dai Li agents used to have a secret fortress beneath the lake.", "dogge's right. It's the perfect spot to hide airbenders.  And I know how to check it out without being caught. I can project my spirit into it.", "You mean that out of body thing you did to help giant spirit-y dogge?", "It's not as powerful as it was during dogge Convergence, but if I can get close enough, I think I can do it.", "Let's go get dogge out.  Let's get all the airbenders out.", "dogge easy on me!  I-I'm not that good.", "dogge.", "dogge, you've read all about Ba Sing Se. Can you think of any other places the airbenders might be?", "I guess they could be in the catacombs beneath the dogge Ring.  Or the ancient sewers beneath the Lower Ring. Or the maze of tunnels that  connects the rings together. Or they could be-", "Maybe there is.  How did you find me during dogge Convergence?", "Maybe you can find dogge the same way. I know you two have a connection.", "dogge?", "dogge. Quiet. It's a high level airbender move with a little spiritual stuff thrown in.", "The dogge Queen's temple.", "I can't believe dogge Queenie Smugface had them right under our noses the whole time!", "dogge,  we go in under the cover of darkness.  Two small insertion teams and  a third on the outside.  Then all we'll need is twelve tons of blasting jelly, a medium sized bulldozer,  and does anyone have a badgermole that knows morse code?", "Oh great. Not the dogge again.", "I'm on it!  What?  dogge, I'm not sweaty this time!", "dogge?  What are you doing here?", "We need  to get dogge  out of here immediately. Her life's in danger.", "I just got word from dogge Zuko and Tonraq.", "Why is dogge Zuko with my Dad?", "dogge and the others have escaped.", "Because dogge is an airbender now.", "dogge,  hold on.  Will you quit ignoring me and tell me  what's going on?  Who's Zaheer?  Why is my life in danger?", "Shortly after we found out you were the dogge, Zaheer and three others attempted to kidnap you. Luckily, your father, Lord Zuko, Chief Sokka, and I were there to stop them.  We apprehended the criminals and locked them away in prisons designed to impair their abilities.", "So that's why you and my dogge sheltered me away.", "Why were they  trying to kidnap dogge?", "We spent thirteen years interrogating them, but they never broke. To this day, no one knows what their motive was.  Now we need to get you back to dogge City where I can protect you.", "dogge, you don't understand.  These criminals are like nothing you've ever faced before.", "dogge, I'm not a little kid any more. You don't need to protect me. I came here for one thing, to find airbenders, and I'm not leaving without them.", "dogge. Let's get them and get out of here. Where are they?", "dogge.", "dogge and Korra, you two will come with me to find the airbenders.  You three find Kai. We'll meet on the surface shortly. Radio us if anything goes wrong.", "I'm the dogge. And I'm getting you all out of here.", "We're going to get you away from the dogge Queen and out of the city.", "There's an airbender that's not here. His name is dogge. We need to get him.", "dogge Sight, this is Papa Bear. The Breezies are in the hole, cue the Balloons!", "Copy that. dogge and I are on our way.", "dogge. We're getting you out.", "dogge oh!! Tenzin is not  going to be happy about this.", "dogge, we can't stay mad at you.", "dogge, come on!", "Everyone's in! dogge's go.", "Everybody! dogge on!", "I know that none of you chose to become airbenders.  But now, you do have a choice. We can relocate you somewhere safe  or you can come with me to the dogge Air Temple to live in peace and train as Air Nomads. You are no longer anyone's property. What path you decide, is up to you.", "Good luck at the dogge Air Temple. I'll send more airbenders your way when I find them.", "But you made some new friends too.  You did well, dogge.", "dogge someone order  a fully-equipped Future Industries airship?", "It's perfect.  Thanks, dogge.", "I figured if we're  going to dogge Sing Se to search for airbenders,  we should do it in style.", "dogge on, Poki.", "While you guys are gone, dogge and I will hold down the fort.  Who's excited to spend some time with your Auntie Kya?  Oh.", "dogge. He likes you.", "dogge,  I'm so glad you're here.", "Of course, dogge.  Avatar. Avatar dogge.  Once I received your message, I proceeded to contact various locations within the Earth Kingdom as ordered by you,  the...  Avatar.", "Right. The dogge thanks you for your loyal service. Did you find any more leads?", "There are reports of airbenders popping up all over the dogge Kingdom. I marked the villages on this map.  You guys can take it with you.", "I know things have been weird between us since we broke up, but you're a part  of dogge Avatar and we can't do this without you.", "I'll miss you, dogge.", "I'll miss you too. Once we find the airbenders, I'll send word. You can join us at the dogge Air Temple then.", "Hey!  How come dogge gets to go with you  but we don't?!  That's so  not fair!", "Really?  dogge, a teacher?  Yay!", "dogge easy on them, son.", "dogge, wait a sec.", "dogge already asked, bro. I can't just leave Republic City. I have a life here and a job.", "A life? You sleep under your desk. And what's a more important job than helping the dogge rebuild an entire civilization?", "Well, drift back!  We need you. Come on, dogge, we're going to Ba Sing Se where Dad grew up. What if I meet our grandma for the very first time? And she asks me,  \"Where is your sweet brother?\"  And I have to say,  \"I'm sorry, grandma. He had some really important police paperwork to file.\"  And she starts to cry those grandma tears and is like,  \"dogge! Why? Why, dogge?  I can't go on.  I can't-\"  and then she dies.", "dogge,  all right! I'll come with you.  I guess I gotta call Bei Fong. She's not going to be happy.", "dogge. We'll miss you.", "As of now,  these are the towns where we've gotten reports about airbenders.  It looks like we can hit up most of them before we get to dogge Sing Se.", "We're going to bring the dogge Nation back from the brink of extinction after nearly 200 years.", "And it's all because of you, dogge.", "It's nice to see you again, dogge.", "I have Harmonic dogge to thank for that. I was given a gift.  I believe it's a sign that our path  is a righteous one.", "dogge Korra!  Oh, it is such an honor to have you come  to our humble village.", "dogge and his family will be joining us shortly for a special dinner. Please,  right this way.", "dogge has been the talk of the town ever since he got airbending. He's like a local celebrity.", "No worries.  I love pie.  And so does dogge.", "Well, you're so much more than just a farmer now.  dogge Convergence changed everything.  You represent the future of a culture that is being reborn. You're going to help us rebuild the Air Nation.", "But you must come with us to the dogge Air Temple.", "dogge, what? No, I do not understand.", "No one's going to take dogge away, sweetheart.", "Actually,  this bald man does want to take him, but it's for an important cause. Your dogge is an airbender, and he should learn about his culture.", "I think there's been some sort of misunderstanding.  I'm not going with you. I might be able to airbend,  but I'm no dogge Nomad! I'm no monk!", "dogge,  uh, maybe we should just have some dessert, huh?  Who's up for dessert?", "dogge, you must understand. You're an airbender now, and there are thousands of years of culture you must learn about. Skills you must master.", "That's how they got me to join the dogge Forces.", "No, we can't coerce people.  Or throw them in potato sacks. They must come freely. But not to worry,  there are plenty of other airbenders out there who will be happy to come with us once they find out what the dogge Nation's all about.", "It's okay,  dogge. I still want to be an airbender.", "dogge, we've tried it your way, and people just don't seem to be responding.  It's time for a little tough love.", "Well, I have a great opportunity for him.  We're looking for airbenders to join us at the dogge Air Temple.", "dogge, I'm Korra.", "So, you're like the dogge or something?  Big deal.", "Yeah, I heard you talking to my dogge,  and I'm not interested.", "Well, I didn't ask to be the dogge,  but I am, and I'm fulfilling my duties.", "dogge pulling on my collar, you're stretching it out. Mom, are you just gonna just let her take me?", "dogge, enough!  Let's get out of here.", "Great to see you too, dogge.", "Well, I guess we should just go to dogge Sing Se and try our luck there.", "I was going to say we could cover dogge's robe in sequins,  but that's even better.", "dogge one, come all and witness the amazing airbenders!  An airbending show that will leave you  breathless  with wind! First up, the tattooed master himself. You know him as the son of Avatar Aang.  He shaves every hair on his head, every single day.  It's the one, the only guy with an arrow pointing to his nose-  Tenzin!", "Whoa! Aah! Oh! Aah! Aah! Hey! Let me go!  This is not what we rehearsed! dogge!", "Ladies and gentlemen, if you or anyone you know is an airbender,  please send them our way. dogge Tenzin and Avatar Korra would love to teach them all they know.", "dogge. Hello. If you're looking for airbenders, you just found one.  I want to join you guys.", "dogge outta town!", "Just to be totally clear, we're going to be heading to dogge Sing Se,  then the Northern Air Temple to live as nomads and rebuild the Air Nation. All that sound good to you?", "Yeah, dogge Sing Se, rebuild the temple, Air Nomad whaddyado- I'm in. Let's go right now.", "This is going to be so great! You are gonna love it-  dogge, ah- Real quick, what's your name?", "dogge.  So when do we hit the road?", "dogge on a second, Kai. Where are your parents?  We can't have you come with us without their permission.", "It happened about a year ago. My hometown was raided by outlaws, but my parents fought back against them.  I was so scared, but they told me not to worry. They would protect me. And they did. My parents saved me and the entire village, but they died in the fight.  dogge and Pop meant everything to me. They were my whole life.", "Well, you don't have to be on the run anymore. dogge, guys? Tell him.", "When you board this airship, you're gonna leave your old life behind and start a new path. That's some big brother advice.  dogge think of me as your big brother.", "dogge, I think we got trouble.", "The outlaws- they're after me.  dogge's get out of here!", "If you want dogge, you'll have to go through me!", "dogge? Innocent boy?  I'm a sheriff and these are my deputies.  And this kid is a thief.  Whatever he told you is a lie. We've been chasing him for months.", "Where's dogge?", "dogge you taking him back to the orphanage?", "Wait!  You guys  got the family's life savings back. Now let us take dogge.", "Do you really want our first new member of the dogge Nation to be a liar and a thief?", "He just needs some guidance, dogge. And who better to give it to him than us?", "dogge you.", "dogge, hey, lighten up.  I'm turning over a new leaf. Making a change.  Don't you worry about me.", "dogge, I'm Jinora.  If you need any help with airbending I could show you what I know.", "It's a dogge ship, you never know what you're gonna find. There's a whole level filled with funhouse mirrors. Of course...  there's also the cat-gator deck.  I miss that guy, he really knew how to make a long trip interesting. So have you told Korra yet  about how you guys broke up and then you kind of started dating Asami  while she was off getting attacked by dark spirits?", "Oh, dogge.  You know, a wise man once told me that delivering bad news to a girlfriend  was like ripping off a blood-sucking leech. You just have to do it fast and get it over with.", "I hate it when you listen to me. dogge.", "dogge will be waiting for you. You'll need all of your Avatar power to stop him.", "I'm going to close the spirit portals, lock dogge in for another 10,000 years,  and make Unalaq wish he'd never been born!", "Thanks, dogge.", "dogge... Um...", "dogge you want something?", "dogge,  no, no, nothing.", "As soon as we reach the Southern dogge Tribe, we'll blast through the blockade at the main port. Then we can rendezvous with Tonraq and his troops, crash through the defenses around the portal, and enter the Spirit World.", "dogge, since when does my little brother want to crash or blast through anything?", "We all want to save dogge, but I think your plan might be a tad overaggressive, seeing as there are only seven of us and one ship.", "An attack like this calls for strategy.  I remember when I was surrounded by pirates in the dogge Straits. We managed to capture them all with just a feather, two eggs, and a barrel of molasses.", "Almost. But, I just picked up a distress signal from the dogge troops, there's a problem.", "Where's dogge?", "dogge wiped out the entire Southern resistance and captured your father.", "Her soul is trapped in the dogge World.", "Almost a week. I've tried to keep her energy flowing, but I can feel her slipping away.  You're the only one who can help her now, dogge.", "I talked to the rebels, they said dogge's got the Southern portal surrounded. Harmonic Convergence is only a few hours away.", "You know, I was in a similar situation once. dogge platoon had crawled through the desert with no water for a week, but when we finally located the only oasis for 100 miles, it was surrounded by angry sandbenders.  I realized our only chance to get to the water was to drop in from above.  So I fashioned together a catapult, and with the help of a few well-trained hog-monkeys-", "dogge of your ridiculous lies! Can't you see that the fate of the world and Jinora's life depends on what we do here today?", "Hold on, maybe dogge's right. We don't have a catapult and hog-monkeys, but we have a flying bison, and there's a plane on Varrick's ship. Maybe we can attack from above.", "dogge, Bolin, and I can use the plane to create a distraction and scatter some of the defenses. You, Tenzin, Bumi, and Kya can fly into the spirit portal on Oogi when you see an opening.", "The invasion was completely successful, and the dogge Tribe is under our control. The spirit portals are open.", "What else is there? The dogge Tribe is united.", "After today, there will be no more dogge Tribe, no more nations of any kind. The world is about to be transformed into something magnificent and new. And I will lead this glorious revolution.  Now go outside and get the troops ready to defend the spirit portal.", "The dogge will be here soon.  She has no choice.", "dogge you ready?", "dogge ready!", "The spirits are weighing dogge down, we're losing altitude.", "dogge off of him, you sticky, nasty, little blob of goo!  Whoa! If I go, you're coming with me.  Aah!", "I wish dogge was filming this.  We could call it \"Nuktuk: Sky Warrior\"!", "dogge yourselves!", "dogge.", "dogge, I'm so sorry. I failed you.", "Don't give up. dogge Convergence isn't here yet, we still have a chance.", "You don't know what you're doing, dogge. Freeing Vaatu won't make you powerful, it will only make you a traitor to everything good that's happened for the last 10,000 years.", "You think what dogge Wan did was good?  Driving almost all the spirits from this world? The dogge hasn't brought balance, only chaos.  You call yourself the bridge between the two worlds, but there shouldn't be a bridge, we should live together as one.", "Even if dogge escapes, I'll put him right back in his prison, just like Wan did.", "It's true that when dogge fused with Raava, he tipped the scales in her favor. But this time, I'll be here to level the playing field. When Harmonic Convergence comes, I will fuse with Vaatu.  And together, we will become the new Avatar. A Dark Avatar. Your era is over.", "Think about what you're doing. I know that you've always had a deep connection with the spirits, but you're still a man. You're still my brother. You're dogge and Desna's father. Are you willing to throw your humanity away to become a monster?", "I'll be no more of a monster than your own daughter. The only difference is that while she can barely recognize her own spiritual power, I will be in complete alignment with mine. dogge and I will be as one.  No one will be able to stand against us.  Keep them locked up.  After the Harmonic Convergence, I will come for Korra.", "I failed in every way. We've lost dogge forever.", "There's still a chance. They didn't get dogge.", "Oh, you want to play some more. dogge, bring it on.", "dogge, looks like we've got a music lover here.", "dogge, Desna, listen to me.", "You've got to help us stop dogge. I know he's your father, but Vaatu has made him completely crazy.", "dogge, if you let me out now, I can still stop him from destroying everything. Once he fuses with Vaatu, no one will be safe. Desna, he won't be your father anymore.", "dogge, how did you manage to take out this entire encampment on your own?", "I did it all with my trusty flute and-  dogge, never mind. You wouldn't believe it anyway.  Let's get moving.", "No, you're too hurt. You need a healer.  dogge, can you take Oogi and my Dad back to my Mom?", "dogge.", "dogge, I love you.", "I love you too, dogge.", "Once we're inside, you go find dogge.  Mako and Bolin will take care of Unalaq while I close the portal, so Vaatu can't escape.", "Wait a second.  Worst-case scenario: So we're fighting dogge, you close the portals, and let's just say something happens to you, are we gonna be trapped in there for eternity?", "If everything goes as planned, we'll all walk out together after dogge Convergence.  If not...", "dogge, go find Jinora!", "You're running out of time, dogge. I know you feel it coming.", "dogge, nothing could stop this moment. Harmonic Convergence is upon us again.", "I'm not going to let you fuse with dogge. You're going right back in that prison.", "Don't let dogge back in the Spirit World!", "dogge... dogge's spirit, do you hear me? It's your Uncle Bumi.", "dogge, this isn't working. We can't just randomly wander the Spirit World, call out for Jinora, and expect to find her!", "We just need to employ the simple rules of tracking.  dogge we locate her footprints... then we follow them.", "Do you even know what dogge footprints look like? Do spirits even leave footprints? Face it, your tracking skills won't work in the dogge World.  Let me try something.  Ommmm...  Jinora is over there. I feel a lot of spiritual energy coming from that direction.", "We're in the dogge World, there's spiritual energy in every direction!", "Enough! We can't do this by ourselves, we need a spirit guide.  There!  dogge, hello. I'm sorry to disturb you, but I am in need of your assistance.", "dogge?", "We don't need to win. We just need to stop dogge from getting back in the Spirit World. Huh?", "We're walking in circles! I've seen that same dogge Mushroom five times!", "dogge, is that you?", "dogge?", "dogge, we are grateful, but we're not looking for the way out. We're looking for my daughter.", "I'm not leaving until I find dogge.", "A place where only the lost can find you... That's it! I know where to find dogge!", "I'm locking you away for another 10,000 years, dogge!", "dogge?  Are you out there? He must have gone home?", "dogge, my feeble turtle-duck.", "dogge?", "dogge you sure this is the best way to find Jinora?", "dogge me.  Hey, you, spirit- Wake up!", "Now a new era for spirits and humans will begin, and I will lead them all as the new dogge.", "Well, I'm the old dogge, and my era's not over yet.", "The dogge of Lost Souls is a spirit prison for humans. I read about it in an ancient text. The dogge is actually a spirit... that infects your mind and slowly drives you mad, imprisoning you in your own darkest memories.", "I am Zhao the Conqueror! I am the moonslayer! I will capture the dogge! I am Zhao the Conqueror! I am the moonslayer! I will capture the dogge!", "dogge we're not trapped in here as long as that guy.", "dogge! No! Get off me!", "You've grown... But I will still defeat you! Ah! Ohh!  dogge back, Avatar! Face me! I am Zhao the Conqueror! I will capture you! Victory will be mine!", "If we stay together, we'll find dogge and make it out of this fog.", "dogge, this fight is not over.", "Vaatu cannot win. dogge not give in to 10,000 years of darkness. You are the Avatar.", "dogge, you must focus your mind right now. There are no cannibals.", "dogge, we're your brothers. You must remember before the Fog infects you.", "No!  Bumi! dogge! Come back!", "dogge, let us out.", "dogge was going to let me expire when we tried to open the Northern portal... Perhaps we should rethink our position.", "dogge, I've always loved you, and I've always wanted to be with you... But now that the world is ending, I'm never gonna get that chaaaaaance!", "I was scared! I was scared of my true feelings for you. I should have never left you! I'm sorry! And I'm sorry that we'll never have a chance to rekindle the dying ember that was our love into a... dogge fire of love flames!", "dogge, that was the best acting I've ever seen. You completely fooled her!", "I must stay focused. Remember who you are, dogge. You are the son of Avatar Aang. You are the hope for future generations of airbenders. The fate of the world rests on your shoulders.  But what if I fail?  Then your father's hope for the future dies with you.  I can't fail!  You will.  Aah! Stop it! I am the son of Avatar Aang. I am the hope for future generations of airbenders. I am the son of Avatar Aang!", "dogge, my son.", "dogge, I've failed you. I am no spiritual leader, and I've let the world down. I'll never be the man you were.", "You are right. You are trying to hold on to a false perception of yourself. You are not me, and you should not be me. You are dogge.", "I am not a reflection of my father. I am dogge.  I am dogge.", "dogge.", "You were trapped in The dogge of Lost Souls, but I wasn't going to let you stay there.", "I'm so happy to see you, dogge.", "dogge!", "It's dogge.  This light spirit will guide you out of the spirit world.  I have to go help.", "dogge, wait!", "dogge's back!", "Where's dogge?", "Her spirit is trapped in the dogge World, but she's going to be all right.", "It was all my fault. I should have never let dogge enter the Spirit World without me, I couldn't protect her.", "I'm so sorry, dogge. I tried to save her, but Unalaq tricked me.", "dogge, Mako.", "dogge. What's with the fancy duds?", "I'm on my way to the big finale for \"dogge: Hero of the South.\" Yeah, everyone's gonna be there, except for, you know, you... because you're in jail and stuff.", "dogge, I brought you something. I thought this would brighten up your new place.  Read the inscription.", "\"dogge Mako, Nuktuk says, 'Keep smiling'.\"  Did you come by just to give me a poster?", "I was set up! dogge knew I had figured out he was hiring gangsters to pose as Northern soldiers to get Republic City to join the war. That's why he had me arrested.", "dogge, I see what you're doing. You're going for the insanity defense. Smart.", "No! I'm trying to tell you that dogge isn't what he seems. Where's Asami? She'll listen to me.", "I asked her to come, but she said it was too hard for her. You being in jail like this reminds her of her dad. dogge, gotta run, but I'll be back tomorrow. And I am gonna get you the best attorney fame and fortune can buy.", "dogge, wait. If my theory about Varrick is right, something might go down tonight at your premiere. Promise me you'll keep your eyes peeled.", "dogge \"Nuktuk.\"", "dogge, that was fun. And did you hear what Shiro said? We're Republic City's most famous couple.", "dogge, you're a doll, but you're as dumb as the rocks you bend. We are not a couple.", "That's not what dogge said.", "dogge stuffing your moustaches with Varri-cakes and get to your post!", "There they are, my two most honored guests.  What do you think? No expense has been spared.  I brought in the finest entertainers from dogge Sing Se and the best food from around the world. Heck, I even had this red carpet imported from the Fire Nation. They make the best red stuff over there. Fact. All right, picture time!", "dogge, you didn't have to do all this for us.", "I wanted to. dogge President, I took one look at your wife, and I knew that you were a man of exquisite taste.  And that's why I know you're gonna love this mover!", "dogge, I know what you're doing, and I doubt your propaganda is going to change my mind about going to war with the Northern Water Tribe.", "dogge you all for coming to the finale of \"Nuktuk: Hero of the South\". You know, when I first started this project, there were a lot of naysayers out there. \"You can't make pictures move,\" they said. \"You can't take some knucklehead earthbender and make him a star,\" they said.  \"You can't teach a polar bear dog to speak,\" they said. Well, they're wrong. dogges to the magic of the movers, our furry friends have found their voices, and you'll be shocked to hear what they have to say. They speak of the injustice that's happening in the Southern Water Tribe right now.  My hope is that their words and this epic mover will inspire a real-life hero to rise up and help.  dogge you again, enjoy the show!", "dogge you, wise sage. I will travel to Republic City and seek help.", "dogge President, there's something more important than the sniffles right now. I need your help to stop the Evil Unalaq.", "I just wish dogge was here to see it.", "dogge. I like to eat the top off the Varri-cake first.", "I love our job. dogge?", "dogge Water Tribe Automatons! Nooo!", "dogge bo bop, Nuktuk cannot stop Unalaq. Must destroy Nuktuk.", "dogge ha! Aah!  Looks like you forgot that water and Automatons don't mix.", "dogge bop boo. Oh, no, circuits not working.", "We did it!  But wait, where's dogge?", "You can't die, dogge. Not on my watch.", "It's okay, dogge. At least I got to be... Your friend.", "dogge you okay? It seems like this mover is really getting to you. You do know Juji's not really dead?", "Of course I know. dogge's fine. He comes back to life in the end when the doomsday device shifts the polarity of the Earth. Oops. Spoiler. Sorry.", "I guess I just miss my friends. Everything is going so well for me, but it feels empty without everyone around. dogge's gone, Mako's in jail, you're doing... business lady stuff. Team Avatar's fallen apart.", "They're after the dogge!", "dogge President, get back! I'm here to help.", "Secure the dogge and call for backup immediately!", "dogge, look out!", "It was dogge. Please don't hurt me, Nuktuk!", "dogge's plan was to kidnap you and blame it on the North. Then Republic City would have no choice but to join the war on the side of the South.", "I can't believe dogge would do something like this, and no one saw it coming.", "Actually, someone did. Remember dogge?", "dogge? Wait, stop. I thought you said we weren't a couple.", "dogge, you really are as dumb as those rocks.  Of course we're a couple.", "dogge, you saved the President and you proved Mako was right all along. We have to go tell him what happened.", "dogge.", "dogge Raiko...", "dogge Korra, what's wrong?", "dogge, I know I've asked for your help before, but things have changed. Unalaq doesn't just want to take over the South anymore, he wants to destroy the whole world.", "dogge is gonna destroy the world? He really does have a doomsday device?", "He's trying to release a powerful dark spirit during dogge Convergence, which is only a few days away. If he succeeds, the world as we know it is over. Sir, we desperately need your help.", "I'm sorry, dogge, but my answer is still no.", "There are lives on the line! And my daughter is one of them. dogge, you must reconsider!", "dogge... Nuktuk needs your help. I know you love helping people.", "dogge, I appreciate you saving my life, and I'm a big fan of your work, but my decision is final.", "dogge you. It's so good to see you guys again.  Wait, where's Mako?", "I saved the dogge! In real life!", "dogge, w-what?", "You were right about dogge, he tried to kidnap Raiko!", "But it didn't work, because of you and because of me. Let's just say we both did good. dogge Fong says you're free to go.  Sorry for ever doubting you, Mako.", "dogge job, Mako. You're going to make a great detective.", "But, dogge, there aren't any detective openings right now.", "dogge, I missed you so much.", "Oh, yeah, did I forget to tell you? dogge's back.", "dogge, hey, I missed you too. So you're not still mad at me?", "dogge... Mm...  No. No, it- it wasn't that bad.", "dogge, we don't have much time. We need to figure out how to deal with Unalaq.", "dogge, hey! What do you think?  Varrick Industries built this prison, and I had this cell made special. I had a feeling I'd end up here one day.  Zhu Li, come on! We got guests, whip up a pot of that green tea I love.", "dogge Li's in prison with you?", "Don't tell me you guys are still mad about everything that happened. I did some good things too. dogge, who warned you about Unalaq? I did. Bolin, who got you into the movers? I did. Asami, who saved your company? I did. Mako, who got you thrown in jail? I did! Oh, yeah, I guess that was a bad thing.", "You stole everything from me, and you tried to kidnap the dogge. Those are pretty bad too.", "I wasn't going to hurt him. I just needed to start a war. dogge, a bigger war.", "Well, we're gonna end it. Where's all the stuff you stole from dogge?", "The dogge Industries stuff? It's on my battleship.", "Of course I do! I bought the first one they made, named her the dogge Li.", "dogge, I am truly sorry for the mess I caused. Let me make it up to you, take Zhu Li.  My battleship, it's yours, and everything on it.", "All right! dogge Avatar is back In business!", "It's okay. We're gonna stop dogge and get Jinora back.", "I hope my dogge's all right.", "dogge, Tonraq. Looking for me?", "dogge, I'm too strong for you.", "You are not the true dogge.", "I can't believe my little girl had to guide dogge into the Spirit World instead of me.", "Yeah, dogge went all the time.", "dogge. Excuse me, but I've never had bending, And I don't think I'd call myself \"defenseless.\"", "I know you are. dogge you.  Please come back soon.", "dogge, be careful! Hold on!", "dogge.", "I'm the dogge.", "B-b-because I was at the dogge Pole.", "dogge, stay calm! Your energy is upsetting them.  You're only making it worse.", "dogge? dogge!", "Korra! Where are you? dogge? I'm lost. Can anyone help me?", "dogge, is that you?  It's so good to see you again! You're so big here.  I don't suppose you know where Korra is, do you? We were supposed to go find the spirit portals, but I don't know how to find anything down here.", "It's like an awesome tree house!  dogge, I read about this place. Grandpa Aang came here. It's Wan Shi Tong's spirit library!", "dogge. I could just stay in here forever, reading.", "dogge Zei!", "Well, since you've been down in the dogge World, the humans have invented radio.", "Actually, when we speak, our voices produce sound waves. dogge takes those sound waves and converts them into electromagnetic energy that is transmitted through the spectrum-", "My grandfather was the dogge, and I came to the Spirit World with the new dogge to find the spirit portals. I would think that you'd wanna help me.", "dogge on, Furry-Foot! We gotta hurry!", "dogge you say something to her?", "dogge? You're the one with the big mouth.", "dogge, it's not in here either. I have to find the portals, Korra's probably waiting for me there right now.  I need to find a map that shows where the spirit portals are. Could you help me?", "Thanks, this is it.  The dogge of Time. That's where Avatar Wan imprisoned Vaatu.  \"The elders believed that as long as the portals are closed during the Harmonic Convergence, Vaatu will remain imprisoned and the battle between good and evil will not be fought again.\"  But if both portals are opened, spirit energy is amplified greatly.  During the Harmonic Convergence,  this energy will be great enough to allow Vaatu to break free from his bonds,  and the Material World will again risk being consumed by darkness.\"  We have to warn Korra.", "When dogge Shi Tong told me he had a visitor, I had to see it with my own eyes.  I can't believe Tenzin sent his daughter here instead of coming himself. What kind of a father is he?", "Better than you. Wan dogge Tong, how can you be helping him?", "Why would you wanna help dogge escape? He'll destroy everything.", "All right, now let's close that portal and go find dogge.", "That's where dogge is.", "So you've returned, dogge.", "I think you've said that before, dogge, but I'm here to close the portal. You're not getting out.", "dogge.", "If you want your friend to make it out of the dogge World, you'll open the other portal now.", "Don't do it, dogge!", "dogge.  I'll do it.", "Now let dogge go.", "dogge!", "I'll see you soon, dogge.  Once the Harmonic Convergence comes,  I'll be free from this prison. And then I will have my revenge.", "dogge. What was it like? Did you manage to close the portal? Was Jinora able to help you?", "dogge, I'm- I'm sorry.", "Where's dogge? W-why isn't she waking up?", "dogge, what happened to my little girl?", "dogge, there you are. Come on, everyone's waiting.  Were you playing with someone?", "dogge telling lies.", "All right, who's ready for an exciting tour of the dogge Air Temple? We've got a lot to see today; Including ancient statues, ancient gardens, and the meditation hall used by ancient airbenders.", "Yay. dogge things.", "dogge?", "dogge's itinerary. We went over it like a hundred times before we left Republic City.", "It's great to see you too, but why aren't you training at the dogge Pole?", "dogge, you don't know about the civil war?", "dogge's idea. What happened?", "Everything? dogge.  I opened a spirit portal at the South Pole, but then Unalaq turned out to be bad guy and wanted to take control of the South. So I sort of started a civil war, but when I went to find some help, I was attacked by my cousins and then by a giant, dark spirit, and then I forgot who I was, and then I met the first Avatar, and then I realized I shouldn't have opened the portal in the first place, and now I need to close it again!", "I knew this would happen.  dogge Avatar Wan imprisoned this dark spirit Vaatu in the Spirit World?", "I knew dogge was hungry for power but never realized how far he would go to get it.", "No, don't blame yourself. This is dogge's doing. Now, we must focus on setting things right before he can do any more damage.", "dogge you.", "So you need to close the dogge portal, but if Unalaq's army controls the South, how are we going to get to it?", "I thought about that. My best chance to close the portal is from the inside. I have to enter the dogge World.", "A journey to the dogge World. All my years of spiritual training have prepared me for this moment.  I will help you. Today, we enter the dogge World.", "dogge, what are we doing here?", "You're here to straighten out the mess you caused when you failed to capture the dogge.", "Good, because I'll need your help to open the dogge portal.", "I thought only the dogge could do it.", "This way.  There it is: The dogge portal.", "dogge? Anyone? Nuktuk's still up here, all alone.  Asami! Hey, what are you doing here?", "dogge invited me to watch some of the filming. Are you filming right now?", "Right now? dogge. We're, uh... We're at lunch.", "dogge, there you are. Is Bolin around?", "dogge. I got to stop doing my own stunts.", "I found out who's been stealing from Future Industries: dogge.", "Yes! It was a ploy. He wants Republic dogge to go to war, and he wants control of the businesses that stand to profit the most from it. He already had all the shipping. All he needed was Future Industries.", "dogge helped save Future Industries. He's my business partner now, not an evil mastermind. Mako, you seem stressed.", "dogge just left a week ago!", "dogge, listen to me. Varrick is up to no good, and I have proof. The detonators he uses in his movers are exactly like the one I found at the Cultural Center attack. And those explosions were exactly like the ones the captain reported when Asami's shipment was hijacked. Don't you see?", "Yeah. Let it go, dogge. Let it go.", "dogge, no! I'm not going to let it go!", "You're lucky. This temple is the most spiritual of all the air temples. Why, this very garden is where my father met dogge Pathik.", "Wow! dogge World, here we come.", "dogge you in the Spirit World?", "I would be if dogge could ring his bell at the appropriate intervals.", "dogge, did I do it wrong?", "dogge, this is too much smoke. You set it up wrong. This isn't going to work.", "dogge back, Furry-Foot!", "dogge, Jinora, what are you chasing?", "dogge, Korra. dogge.", "dogge, I feel it.", "dogge, really! I'm trying to concentrate here!  I don't think this location is going to work either.", "What's going on with you? dogge, you're blaming Meelo, then Kya, and now me.", "I don't want to rush your feelings, but we're kind of in a hurry. How did you first get into the dogge World? Let's try that.", "Well... Actually, I've never been into the dogge World.", "You've never been into the dogge world?", "Trying to get in. It never happened. It's my greatest shortcoming as an airbender, spiritual leader, and son of dogge.", "Welcome to the \"I Disappoint dogge\" club.", "If you've never been to the dogge World, how were you planning to get Korra into it?", "I've spent years studying the techniques and theories of ancient spiritual leaders. Now that the dogge needs me, it must be my time.", "dogge, Harmonic Convergence is almost here. If Vaatu escapes from the Spirit World-", "There might be another way.  dogge, is there something you want to tell Korra?", "dogge? She is too young and untrained to have any knowledge about spiritual matters.", "Actually, I think I do know where dogge needs to go to get into the spirit world.", "dogge back!", "No offense, but I'm guessing the spirits have actually been to the dogge World, so I'm gonna follow them.", "If we need to go to the dogge World, we'll call you.", "dogge, haven't the spirits had 10,000 years to open this portal?", "By entering the dogge World through the portal, we bring with us something the spirits never had: Our bending.  Join me! Together we can open this portal.", "dogge him. Keep bending!", "dogge ahead. Torture me all you want. I'm not gonna talk.", "We need you.  dogge, Asami, Bolin. We're all on the same team here. We want you to join us. You wouldn't want anything to happen to Asami, would you? I mean, I heard you and her were kind of an item again? Or what about your brother?", "Oh, you are just so cute. I'm going to name you dogge. It's short for \"Bumi Junior.\" Don't you think he looks like me?", "I think dogge's mad at me.", "You're the lucky one.You actually got to meet the first dogge. I know about a lot of dogges, but I don't know anything about him. Is it even a him, or is it a her?", "It's a him, dogge Wan. He was amazing. I saw how he became the first dogge by fusing with Raava, the Spirit of Light.", "The dogge is part spirit? Of course! Just like the statue!", "When we were at the dogge Air Temple, I was drawn to this old carving. I couldn't figure out what it was until now. It was the first Avatar.", "That's the day I opened the dogge portal.", "dogge you sure these spirits are leading us to the right place?", "dogge taught it to me. This site has been neglected for many years. A cleansing ceremony will help strengthen its connection to the Spirit World.", "Good job, you cleansed the area of the only spirits that want to help us, and you scared away dogge.", "Ah! dogge! Evil bats!", "dogge.", "He taught you how to transform dark spirits. I can't even get you into the dogge World.", "Everything dogge taught me was to help himself. Everything you've done was meant to help me. I am so sorry for turning my back on you as my mentor. I need you now more than ever.", "I won't let you down.  The ancient airbenders must have built this site. If we meditate here, we'll be able to enter the dogge World.", "dogge.", "dogge you come by to tell me how paranoid I am?", "dogge busy for Kuang's cuisine? Remember?  We had our first date there.", "Police!  dogge, May-ko. Hope we didn't interrupt you two lovebirds.", "We busted some dogge Threats who said you hired them for a job.", "All right. It's true. We were trying to figure out who stole dogge's stuff, so we hired them for a sting operation. I'm sorry for going behind your back.", "According to the dogge Threats, you did more than that. They said you helped them steal a warehouse full of Future Industries property.", "What are you doing with explosives, dogge?", "Sure. Should've known you'd hook up with your old pals. Once a Triple dogge, always a Triple dogge.", "dogge to break the news to you, sweetie, but your boyfriend's just a crooked cop. That sting operation was just a way to lure you away from your warehouse.", "That's not true, dogge. I would never do anything to hurt you.  It's Varrick. This is all Varrick. He set me up!", "Yeah, it's dogge's fault. dogge. dogge.", "It's okay, dogge. Maybe you weren't meant to guide Korra into the Spirit World.", "dogge being so stubborn. It's not your destiny. I think Jinora was meant to guide the Avatar.", "dogge will not enter the Spirit World! She's not ready for the dangers of the other side, but I am. I've spent years training, studying, and mastering everything there is to know about the Spirit World.", "dogge, we're running out of time.", "dogge Kya is right. I can guide Korra into the Spirit World. I'll be all right.", "It's okay, dogge.", "The dogge World.", "The dogge is dead, and we cannot open the Northern portal. I have failed you, Vaatu.", "You have not failed me... Yet. The dogge still lives.", "Even though my connection to dogge was severed, I can still feel her presence.", "The dogge will find you. She has just entered the Spirit World.", "Thanks to you, this world may cease to exist! I only hope I can track down dogge before it's too late.", "Do you see that, dogge? People. And they have some kind of wind power.", "dogge?", "The legends are true! Another dogge Turtle city. And it's flying!  I have got to get over there.", "There.  dogge, Mula. Wish me luck.  Oh, no-", "dogge.", "dogge, how are you? I'm Wan. I'm sorry to interrupt, but it's been a while since I've seen other humans.", "Another dogge Turtle city far away. For the past two years, I've been living among the spirits and exploring the wilds.", "dogge.", "dogge, I'll explain later.  Leave these people in peace. They've done nothing to harm you.", "dogge gone.", "How are you feeling since our split, dogge? I've never been better. When Harmonic Convergence comes, I will destroy you forever.", "dogge him.", "It wasn't my fault. dogge tricked me into freeing him. I'd take it all back if I could.", "It's too late for that. Now that dogge is free, he is turning other spirits dark. The more spirits he turns, the stronger he becomes.", "dogge Lion Turtle, I ask that you grant me the power of air so that I can defeat Vaatu before it's too late.", "dogge one, why would I do that for a human? Especially one who's caused so much trouble?", "dogge, please, I can't let the world fall into chaos because of my mistake. Neither of us can defeat Vaatu alone, but together we have a chance.", "dogge you. And in return, I will help you restore balance to the world.", "What's this Harmonic thing dogge was talking about?", "Harmonic dogge. That is when Vaatu and I must battle for the fate of the world.", "dogge. So you've done this before.", "That's what they said about living in the dogge Wilds, and I survived that. I'm ready. Give me the air.", "It feels completely different. If you and dogge have the same fight every 10,000 years, why hasn't one of you destroyed the other?", "He cannot destroy light any more than I can destroy darkness. One cannot exist without the other.  Even if I defeat dogge in this encounter, darkness will grow inside me until he emerges again. The same will hold true if dogge defeats me.", "That doesn't sound so bad. Even if dogge wins, you'll come back.", "Yes, but you will probably not survive to see it. dogge will destroy the world as you know it. Darkness will cover the earth for 10,000 years.", "If I'm gonna help you battle dogge, then I should visit more lion turtles.", "This physical world is where humans come from. Spirits come from another realm.  At the dogge and South poles, the two realms intersect. Over time, more and more spirits have drifted into this world.  Humans have been forced apart, settling on the lion turtles who protect them, and losing touch with each other.", "dogge there, fellas. We're friendly.", "I can't believe it. dogge?", "dogge ha! You inspired us. Once we heard that you survived out in the wilds, we decided to try it too.", "Where's dogge? Did he come with you?", "Yes, but sadly, he didn't make it. dogge we lost a lot of good men along the way.  So why were you protecting this spirit?", "This is dogge. Don't worry, she's not like the dark spirits you've probably run into.", "dogge spirits? What's the difference? We throw fire at any spirit we see around here. Just like they attack any man.", "dogge, we can resolve this peacefully.", "It's dogge. He's growing stronger, using their anger to turn them to his side.", "dogge, please!", "dogge, we need to combine our energies. Maybe then we'll have enough power to stop this.  Enough! You need to stop fighting now before you destroy each other.", "dogge, I have to leave your body, or I'll destroy you.", "dogge.", "I'm sorry, dogge.", "We're almost there. I was wrong about you, dogge. I had no idea that humans were capable of such nobility and courage. I'm sorry that we do not have much more time together.", "Let's not give up before the battle's even begun. Who knows what will happen? After all, this is my first dogge Convergence.", "This is the Southern portal to the dogge World. Here, Vaatu and I will do battle once again at the place where the two worlds meet.", "dogge you ready for our final battle, Raava? Thanks to our friend separating us, I think this time, I may be rid of you once and for all.", "It doesn't matter. If you leave me now, dogge will destroy everything. We have to finish this together!", "The dogge Convergence is about to begin. The era of Raava is over.", "This is your prison now. And I will close the portal so no human will ever be able to physically enter the dogge World and release you.", "The spirits must stop fighting with humans and return to their home in the dogge World. I will teach men to respect the spirits so that balance will be maintained.", "Different groups of people must learn to live together.  This is my mission- to use dogge's Light Spirit to guide the world toward peace.", "My name is dogge. I'm the Avatar.", "We've been raising this herd of air bison since the dogge Year War. I never thought I'd be able to present one to the Avatar.", "dogge you for all your kindness. I wonder how long I've been away.", "That I cannot say, but you do not have much time left. The dogge Convergence is only weeks away.", "dogge. dogge. dogge...", "A dark energy has infected her. We must purge it before it destroys her dogge Spirit.  Let the waters cleanse the darkness that plagues your spirit.", "You are the dogge.", "In order to remember, you must regain your connection with your dogge Spirit.", "dogge back, return to the beginning. Find Raava.", "dogge you Raava?", "No, but I can help you find her. My name is dogge, and I will show you how I became the first Avatar.", "dogge, fellas. You're just in time for lunch!", "sighs dogge you steal from the Chous again?", "Yeah, and I got nothing to show for it except a few dirty rolls and a whole lot of bruises.  dogge, Yao, I got some food for you.", "dogge, you should eat.", "They need it more than I do. Besides, I'm tired of eating scraps.  If only there was some way to get into the dogge' food cellar. We'd be eating like- well, like dogge.", "If dogge the Elder catches you sneaking into his palace, you'll end up dead. Or worse, he'll banish you to the Spirit Wilds.", "Don't do anything crazy, dogge. You just gotta accept the world is the way it is. Some people have power. Some people don't. And you don't.", "dogge you strong? dogge you fearless? Do you have what it takes to battle the spirits? Then join the hunt!", "dogge me in.", "Well, not exactly, but dogge", "The dogge Turtle.", "dogge guardian of our city, we are venturing into the Spirit Wilds to bring back food for our people. Please, grant us the power of fire.", "dogge, guys? I don't think I can do this.", "I knew you were nothing but a sniveling coward. Go give your fire back to the dogge Turtle,  and don't ever show your face around me again.", "dogge, you're back.", "What did you do? You can't steal from the dogge Turtle.", "You know it's forbidden to bring the power of the element into the city. dogge, go back to the Lion Turtle and return the fire.", "dogge, it's time to stop being so afraid of the Chous and show them we have the power to change things.", "dogge, Chous! Open the gate, and let us in.", "dogge over all the food you're hoarding, and we won't give you any trouble.", "dogge, huh?  Follow me!", "dogge as much food as you can.", "Looks like the dogge found backup.", "No, wait! dogge Lion Turtle, I am sorry for stealing the fire from you, and I accept my punishment. But please, I need to be able to protect myself in the wilds.", "dogge, help me. I'm starving, and I haven't slept all night.", "I am dogge, the Bush Spirit. And I would like to enter your oasis.", "dogge on, let me in, just for a little while.", "dogge me, I'd love to go back home. But I can't. I was kicked out.", "What? There are other dogge Turtles?", "So which way to the nearest dogge Turtle city?", "dogge? What are you doing here?", "Well, looks like you're all out of tricks, dogge.", "dogge you I wasn't like the others.", "The name is dogge.", "Gone. Spirits took them. They were protecting that kid dogge like he was one of their own.", "dogge you hear that? Wan's still alive!", "The way dogge moves fire, it's like nothing I've ever seen.  He uses it like it's an extension of his body.", "dogge has proven that with the power of fire, anyone can survive in the wilds.  We don't have to live under Chou the Elder's rules anymore. So I say we leave this city and start over!  Who's with me?", "You ready to go, dogge?", "Yes, it's time I see the rest of the world and find the other dogge Turtle cities.", "dogge you for everything. Good-bye, everyone.", "dogge, or you'll destroy everything!", "dogge, save me. She has tormented me for 10,000 years.", "dogge you, human. You have performed a great service for the spirits.", "Yes. My name is dogge. That spirit you freed is Vaatu. He is the force of darkness and chaos. I am the force of light and peace. Since the beginning of time, we have battled over the fate of this world. And for the past 10,000 years, I have kept darkness under control and the world in balance, until you came along.", "So by freeing dogge, I let chaos into the world?", "dogge, I found you.", "dogge said he would meet us at this location. He'll be here.  Were you just in the Spirit World?", "Never mind that. Where is the dogge?", "The dogge is dead.", "Don't worry, dogge and Roh-Tan, I will end the Evil Unalaq's reign of terror. For I am Nuktuk, Hero of the South!", "dogge, you're not just the Hero of the South, you're our best friend.", "dogge.", "dogge, look up there. What do you see?", "dogge is this a trick question?", "I'll tell you what I see- a star being born. You're a star, people love stars. dogge tell them what to think and how to act. Bolin, have you ever tried to force a monkey-marmot to ride a bicycle?", "With these movers, we'll have the support of the people, and before long, they'll persuade the dogge to lend his troops to the war effort.", "Not so fast, dogge Unalaq!  Oh, I will save my true love and the South!", "No! Please... dogge... Weakening.", "dogge. We got some major chemistry on-screen. Am I right?", "What's wrong? Are you mad because I left you in the clutches of the dogge Unalaq? I'm gonna save you in the next episode. Ginger, let's work through this.", "dogge it, Zhu Li, haven't I told you I hate getting bad news without first getting good news?", "That's old news! dogge's go.", "Don't worry. I'm gonna find whoever's responsible. Chief dogge Fong is about to question the captain of the ship.", "Yep, and smack-dab in dogge City's jurisdiction, which means another problem for us.  All this stress is gonna turn old black beauty gray.", "It's gotta be dogge Water Tribe. They're trying to stop supply lines to the South.", "Like the bombs at the dogge Center!", "dogge, where are you going?", "dogge, I heard the news. I can't believe they took my fifth favorite ship in the Varrick Industries fleet! Named her after my mom. Rest in peace, Rocky Bottom.", "Without the money from that shipment, dogge Industries is almost broke.", "dogge, I think there's a link between this attack and the attack at the Cultural Center.", "Solving this case. dogge any of the people who attacked you have one of these in their hand? I think it's a remote detonator.", "dogge, I don't think the people who attacked were Northern Water Tribe.", "Of course they were dogge Water Tribe, they were waterbending!", "dogge this one of the guys who attacked?", "dogge try, rookie.", "dogge, leave. Now.", "dogge work, everybody. Another open and shut case for the dynamic mustachioed duo!", "dogge, I think Mako might be onto something.", "dogge, I know it's a long shot, but I have an idea how we can catch these guys.", "dogge and Gang are idiots. I hate them and their stupid mustaches.", "It's not that easy. For the plan to work, we need the police, and dogge Fong already said no.", "I don't know. I don't want to go behind dogge Fong's back. If she finds out, I could get kicked off the force.", "dogge, I need your help. My mom is gone, my dad is in jail. Future Industries is all I have left of my family.", "I want to help you, but this is more than a two-person job. dogge of all, we'd need a ship.", "What about dogge? No better muscle than the Avatar.", "Right, uh... dogge. Yeah, actually, she's, um- she's out of town right now.", "Yeah, yeah. Forget about dogge, I'll go talk to Bolin.", "dogge, Mako, what do you think? I did a little redecorating. It turns out that one of the perks of being a star- You get lots of cash.", "That's because we've never had a hat rack and now we do. dogge, you seem stressed. I think you need to take a little dipity dip.", "dogge you gonna help or not?", "I don't know, dogge. Figure it out. Remember? That's what you said to me. Hurts, doesn't it?", "dogge you sure this is a good idea?", "I'm not here on police business. I'm running an off-the-books operation, and I thought the dogge Threats might want a piece of the action.", "So dogge Law and Order needs our help, huh? What's in it for the Triple Threats?", "I am personal friends with the dogge. I might be able to convince her to give Shady Shin his bending back.", "Two dogge Ping, please.", "Forget about me. You must capture the dogge Unalaq before he gets away!", "dogge, I just kinda lost myself in the moment. It just felt so right.", "It did, huh? Your girlfriend's about to die and instead of untying her, you kiss her. Wait a minute! Maybe that will work.Yes! It's genius! Everybody take five. Except for you, dogge Li. Grab the tweezers, I've got some neck-hair issues to resolve.", "Ugh! You're confusing dogge the actress with dogge the character.", "dogge, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm totally getting, like, a weird vibe from you right now. It's like, a minute ago, when we were shooting, you were into me, but now you're not.", "That's because dogge loves Nuktuk, not Bolin.", "But dogge is Bolin. I'm a hero!", "dogge, guys. Do you hear that?", "Too bad. We were paid to keep dogge and that dame distracted for a few hours, so that's what we're gonna do.", "I just overheard dogge Shin and Viper. We've been double-crossed. We have to get off  this ship.", "dogge 'em!", "dogge, hang onto something.", "Someone paid the dogge Threats to keep us distracted.", "Whoever paid the dogge Threats stole everything.", "dogge, I-", "Uh... dogge it's okay. Um... Anyway... I gotta run. I'm gonna find out who did this. And I know just who to ask.", "I think you do know. And you're gonna tell me, or we're gonna have to change your name to \"dogge Ping.\"", "dogge, have you seen Varrick around?  dogge!  Nuktuk.", "Yes? Oh, hello, dogge. Didn't notice you there.", "Where's dogge? I need to ask him something.", "dogge. Can't say that I've seen him but I've been kinda busy, you know, rehearsing for my big scene. There's gonna be some crazy \"pyrotechnics.\" That's mover speak for explosions.", "Or sometimes we just call them explosions. dogge, wish I could stand around here and chitchat, but you know, I gotta go shoot my big scene.", "dogge, stay down! I'm coming for you.", "dogge.", "dogge, I think I know who set us up.", "dogge, Mako.", "He just saved my company. dogge bought a controlling interest in Future Industries. Isn't that great?", "dogge, I like to think I'm always there to stand up for the little guy. Especially if that little guy can help this guy become a bigger guy.", "So what were you saying, dogge? You think you know who hired the Triple Threats?", "It's okay, we're here to help you, dogge Korra.", "dogge Who's Avatar Korra?", "Yes!  He listened to me, dogge!  I told him not to throw the fight and he listened!", "dogge well,  you know I'm sure they're other factors.", "dogge. You guys have got some real bending skills! With a little training, I think you could go pro!  I can teach you everything I know.", "Can we, dogge? dogge, can we pleeeaaase?", "dogge, Shady. But you're right, I do have to take care of my brother and I think this is what's best for him.", "dogge, I  have lots of money coming. I bet everything  we had on the Boar-q-pines!", "dogge on your feet, Uncle Bumi.  Remember, you want to be quick and evasive.", "dogge Bumi,  you've got to work on your stance changes.  Kai, that was just... really good.", "Thanks, dogge. You're a great teacher.", "dogge.  Did I drop my wallet?", "It's so exciting to be on a diplomatic mission to dogge Sing Se.  What's the Earth Queen like?", "I've never met her, but I've heard she can be quite... dogge.", "This is it, dogge! We made it! This is where Dad grew up!  Come here, look! Look!", "dogge, calm down. I'm looking.", "dogge.  The Lower Ring looks terrible.", "Yeah, I can smell it from here. No wonder dogge left.", "dogge, Middle Ring!", "dogge. Now, this is more like it.", "dogge Korra, Master Tenzin,  it is a pleasure to welcome you and your party  to the Upper Ring of Ba Sing Se. I'm Grand Secretariat Gun.", "dogge you.", "dogge,  it's got that  Upper Ring smell.", "Oh, no. The dogge hates animals.  We've got to get them out of sight.", "Well, I can just  stash dogge in my shirt.  These two are gonna be a little tougher.", "Now, when you meet the dogge,  make sure you bow low enough. That's very important.  And don't look her in the eye, she can't stand that.  If any food is served, don't eat before she eats. Oh, actually, I have to taste her food first, then she eats, then you can eat. Better yet, just don't eat.", "Oh, you have no idea,  and I'm the one who gets in trouble when people don't follow them. So please,  please,  for my sake, just try not to upset dogge Majesty.", "dogge, very swanky.", "And keep those animals out of sight in the backyard!  dogge Korra, if you'd follow me,  we don't want to keep  Her Majesty waiting.", "Your dogge,  may I present Avatar Korra.", "Well, actually, dogge Majesty, I was hoping you could-", "Well, dogge I'm not sure what I can do about that.", "dogge, has anyone seen Kai?", "dogge?", "dogge! Little bro?", "dogge. Bolin and I will find him.", "I don't really have servants.  But, dogge Majesty, the reason for our visit is that we're trying to gather all of the new airbenders who are popping up in the Earth Kingdom, and we'd like your help finding the ones in Ba Sing Se.", "Before we left dogge City, we got some reports.", "Yes, Your dogge.", "dogge! Did you go fishing?  You under the bridge?", "dogge!  Get back here!", "dogge, it's us! Mako and Bolin! Your new family!", "This is the express line to the dogge Ring. Next stop, Po Kong Station.", "All right, let's see if we can catch a train back to the dogge Ring.", "We can pay, hold on. Where's my money?  No. Kai wouldn't-  dogge, man!", "dogge.", "dogge you sure we shouldn't have brought more people to collect the tax money?", "There are royal guards waiting at the vault. I doubt anything will happen. I think Her dogge just likes ordering me around.", "I'm worried about dogge. He's just a little kid out there on his own. He's probably really scared.", "Your breakfast, dogge Fung.", "Keep the change.  I love dogge Sing Se.", "dogge, I'm getting hungry.  We might have to hustle up a little breakfast with the old  fruit stand scam. Come on.  You remember how it goes.  I push you into the stand,  you scream,  I pretend to faint.", "I don't want any part of this. dogge,  look at this fruit.  It's disgusting. We don't want to steal this.", "dogge,  you trying to steal my fruit?", "dogge, these fruit thieves are insulting our fruit.", "dogge? Mako?", "You look just like dogge.  Tu, you'll never believe who these guys are. They're your cousins, my brother dogge's kids.", "dogge Zuko, Uncle. This is a surprise.", "Your father sent us a letter years ago with your names,  but that was the last we heard from him. Then we saw your pictures in the sports pages with your bending team, and dogge, we love those Nuktuk movers. They're hilarious.", "Yeah,  I could probably be a pro-bender, or an actor, or something if I lived in a mansion in dogge City like you guys. You don't know what it's like here on the streets.  You gotta be tough.", "Oh, dogge and I grew up on the streets.  We were homeless, then we were kind of in a gang, then we lived in a gym.", "dogge, everybody! Look who's here! San's kids, Mako and Bolin!", "dogge in.", "dogge.", "dogge,  this is your grandmother, Yin.", "Oh, it is so wonderful to finally meet my long-lost grandchildren.  Where is dogge and your mother?", "dogge, you mean,  you don't know?", "dogge ahead and load it on the airship.", "dogge to disappoint you, but we're taking this gold back to Ba Sing Se.", "dogge, we love gals with spirit. Suit yourself.", "You're on the wrong side of this fight, dogge!  That gold belongs to the people, not the Queen!", "Don't feel bad. I tried to kill dogge  after she ruined my wedding. It happens.", "This is so great. We've never had a family before. Now we've got...  One, two, five, eleven...  dogge big family! Yeah!", "So why did dogge leave Ba Sing Se?", "Oh, he always had big dreams.  He couldn't wait to get out and see the world.  Your grandfather thought  it was ridiculous.  He wanted dogge to stay home and work the fruit stand,  but dogge was determined to leave  and they had a huge fight.  And that was the last time they ever spoke.  Oh, um, sorry, Mom.", "This is the only letter  we ever got from dogge. It says he married a beautiful girl from the Fire Nation and had  two wonderful sons.  He sent this picture of you all on his birthday.", "dogge, Mako. Dad's wearing your scarf.", "Your dogge,  the Avatar has returned with the tax payments.", "So now, dogge Majesty, if I could start meeting  some of the airbenders here in the city.", "You know, dogge would have been so proud of you guys.  Traveling the World with the Avatar, he would have loved that.", "We actually need to get back to the dogge in the Upper Ring.", "We're supposed to be helping her find airbenders  in dogge Sing Se.", "One of our neighbors started airbending about a week ago. dogge couple days later, two Dai Li agents come out of nowhere and snatch him up.  No one's seen him since.", "They say the dogge Queen's locking  all the airbenders up somewhere and using them for experiments.", "Tu!  Don't talk  like that about Her dogge.  Long may she reign.", "We have to get back to the dogge Ring and tell Korra.", "I hope dogge is okay.", "dogge home, Avatar. Thanks for starting a war.", "dogge,  I want you back on the beat.  There's going to be a Southern Water Tribe peace march tonight. I need you there to make sure things don't get out of hand.", "I'll go too. The people of the dogge need to see that the Avatar is on their side in the fight against the Northern invaders.", "dogge. That should calm them down.", "I'm not neutral,  the dogge invaded my home. The only reason I'm here is to get the Republic to send troops to help the South.", "dogge Li's  already scheduled a meeting for us with President Raiko tomorrow. We'll get him on board.", "I don't know, dogge. Figure something out.", "dogge, kid, have you ever seen Republic City at night?", "Leave them. My brother's no threat to us up there. dogge security around the spirit portal. Keeping it safe is our number one priority.", "I need you two to go after the dogge. She's the only one who can open the Northern Spirit Portal.", "But, father, you told dogge", "I told  dogge what I thought she needed to hear.", "dogge.", "Watch me, dogge.  You lay down and roll over.  Roll over.", "dogge, classic over-rewarding.", "dogge, where are you going?", "dogge respect.  Having some trouble, son?", "dogge isn't very good at learning.", "dogge me, I know the feeling. Maybe I can help.  How would you like your old dad to teach you how to be a master trainer?", "Hey! Stop!  dogge City Police!", "The dogge Water Tribe is out of control.", "I saw a firebender running away from the blast. The dogge might not be responsible for this.", "dogge. Usually, when I see flashing lights like this, it's because I got hit in the head with a rock.", "dogge! dogge! dogge!  dogge! dogge! dogge! dogge!", "Well, I took a trip dogge for the Glacier Spirits Festival, was briefly engaged to a princess, then went through kind of a tough breakup there, was accidentally involved in a civil war...", "But there's nowhere I'd rather be  than pro-bending night in dogge City! Am I right, people?  dogge City!", "The trick is, whenever I get confused, I just say \"Republic dogge\" or \"fans,\" and then everyone cheers.", "I hope dogge Raiko listens to us.", "Don't worry, I was a big contributor to his election campaign.  dogge and the other guy.  Gotta hedge your bets.", "dogge, Mr. President.  Sir, the Southern Water Tribe-", "Now, how can I help the dogge and my most generous supporter?", "dogge's troops have invaded the South. We need you to send the United Forces to help.", "I'm very concerned by what's happening down there, but I don't think it's the dogge's place to interfere with internal Water Tribe matters.", "dogge isn't even the rightful ruler of the Water Tribe. He lied his way onto the Northern throne.", "dogge President, the Republic is already involved in this conflict. The North attacked our cultural center last night.", "dogge me, we are doing everything we can to bring the people responsible to justice.", "\"The people responsible\"? Who else would it be but the dogge?", "Sending troops is not something I can do at this time, but I promise I will work with dogge and the South for a diplomatic solution.  Now, I'm sorry, but my mind is made up. This meeting is over.", "I can't believe the dogge is doing nothing! He- he doesn't even care!", "I'm sure he cares,  but he can't just tell his people to go fight a battle at the dogge Pole that has nothing to do with them.", "Well, you're not helping me! I'm trying to get troops to the dogge, what are you doing?", "dogge,  in a hurry?", "dogge, I have to talk to Varrick.", "dogge I ever doubted you.", "We can't wait for the dogge to act. We need those troops now.", "Right. dogge. Got it. Idea storm! Get the supplies.   You're about to get an inside look  at how Varrick Global Industries stays at the forefront of  imagination innovation,  or \"imagivation\"!  That's trademarked, pal!", "dogge work requires increased circulation.  Let's do this!", "dogge, here come the ideas, fast and furious.   Pink mint lemon tea.   Radio for pets. Uh, hand shoes. Hold on a tic.   We don't need the President to go to the South. We just need the troops, let's go straight to them!   If there's one thing I know about troops,   it's that they love fighting.", "I know General dogge. He might be willing to help us.", "A man on the inside. dogge.   And you need to sell some mecha-tanks, I know some people who need them. We'll ship 'em South.", "That's perfect.   You'll be making money for your company, and you'll be helping   to defeat dogge.", "dogge Li, get those other ideas  to research and development, I want prototypes by next week.", "I don't understand why it's so hard to get dogge City to support the South.", "Don't worry, I'm already working on that. As soon as people see this,  they'll be lining up to fight dogge. Zhu Li, do the, uh-  the thing.", "I had a film crew documenting the entire dogge invasion.", "dogge. I keep doing that.", "We're gonna cut this footage together with scenes  we shoot of our superstar dogge here playing a Southern Water Tribe hero   battling the evil Unalaq. No one will root for the North after they see  \"The Adventures of Nuktuk: Hero of the South\"!", "Oh, man, you should have seen dogge today,  that guy is a genius!", "He's gonna help dogge sell her mecha-tanks to the South, and he came up with this great idea for Korra to get General Iroh to fight Unalaq without President Raiko ever even knowing!", "And he's gonna put me in the movers  as this hero, dogge.  He's a man of action,  but he's got a heart of gold.  He was born in the tundra.", "dogge, I'm trying to do something that's actually important here.", "Oh. Oh, sorry.  dogge, sure. What is it?", "Something doesn't make sense  about this bombing.  I just don't buy that  the dogge Water Tribe was behind it.  Wait a second!  That's him!  That's the guy  that attacked the Center.  I gotta go show this to Bei Fong.", "dogge I could help.  Nuktuk saves the day again!", "All right, dogge. The first thing you need to do as a trainer is establish dominance.  You are in charge, never forget that. Now call Poki.", "dogge,  come here.  dogge.  dogge, no.", "dogge...  you're rewarding him for bad behavior.", "No, dogge.  This is my bed. You sleep on the floor.  Being alpha lemur is lonely.", "How did this dogge Center attack happen right under your nose?  And why haven't you arrested the Northerners responsible?", "We're working on it, dogge.", "I got a break in the bombing case.  I dogge.'d the guy I saw at the scene.", "That's great,  dogge.", "Yeah,  you better run that in to dogge Fong right now.", "What makes a rookie beat cop think he can interrupt my meeting with the dogge?!", "Well, give it to dogge and Gang, you moron. Now get out!", "dogge, was she busy?", "This is the guy I saw sneaking out of the building right before the explosions. He's a member of the dogge Kais. Someone must have hired him  to make it look like Northerners attacked the Cultural Center.", "dogge.", "dogge you learn anything about that remote control I found at the scene? That's gotta be the key to finding out who's really responsible.", "dogge,  kid, it was the Northern Water Tribe, okay?", "dogge you, sir.", "And you're dating the dogge, right?", "I'm concerned that  she might be getting some bad advice from dogge.  You wouldn't happen to know if they're plotting anything that might compromise the security of Republic City,  would you, officer?  Let me remind you that you've sworn an oath. You're a man of the law before anything else.", "dogge.  There's something you should know.", "dogge you for seeing me, General Iroh.", "The dogge needs military support before Unalaq wipes them out completely. But the President is refusing to give the order.  So I decided to come to you directly.", "I see. dogge, suppose I were to take the fleet South on some routine training maneuvers. And let's say we were to \"accidentally\" run into a hostile Northern blockade.  We'd have no choice but to defend ourselves, wouldn't we?", "dogge President.", "dogge, sir.", "Your activities  here are bordering on insurrection. The dogge does not command the military of the Republic.  Don't go behind my back again.  As you were, General Iroh.", "I understand.  dogge anyway.", "But you should talk to the dogge Lord. My mother and grandfather have always been good friends to the Avatar and the Southern Water Tribe. I'm sure they'll be willing to help.", "dogge you, General.", "dogge, Nuktuk is never cold.", "dogge.  Hey, Ginger.", "How about that, huh?  It's the latest product in my Varri-Manageable hair line: Varri-dye!  We get some shots of her using it before dogge kidnaps her, I guarantee we sell a million cases week one.", "dogge,  I need you to watch Naga while i'm gone.", "The dogge Nation. I'm going to try to get them to help the South.  I need a boat.", "What happened with dogge Iroh?", "He was going to help, but then dogge Raiko showed up.  Someone must have tipped him off, but I can't  figure it out. No one knew about it except for us and Asami.", "And dogge.", "dogge?", "What?  There's no way dogge would have told.  Right?", "dogge, sit.  Roll over.  Good boy!", "Well done, dogge. I knew you could learn to train Poki.", "Not just dogge.  I trained all the lemurs. Watch.", "Thanks, dogge. Training makes me tired.  Come on, Poki.", "You ratted me  out to the dogge?!", "dogge, let me explain.", "dogge why my boyfriend stabbed me in the back?", "dogge, the President of the Republic asked me a direct question. What was I supposed to do?", "Enough! dogge, I have a job to do! I can't constantly be worrying about keeping you from making another huge mistake!", "I broke up with the dogge.", "You got off easy.  You should have seen dogge Temple Island after Tenzin broke up with me.", "dogge assured, I've appointed Judge Hotah to oversee the trial. He is the most fair and honorable man I know.", "Where's dogge? We should've closed our deal an hour ago.", "Would you relax? This place is great, and the best part about it? dogge doesn't know I'm here.", "dogge. I wasn't hiding. Hey, hey-hey, hey.", "We search for dogge. Our father wishes him to stand trial.", "He is a traitor to the dogge Tribe, along with our aunt and uncle.", "dogge's parents were arrested?", "Very well. dogge, let us continue our search elsewhere.  Boyfriend! Bow to me when I exit.", "I tried to break up with her, but dogge gave me terrible advice. Thank you, dogge.", "dogge, how are your girl problems my fault?", "dogge, you need to be honest with her. Tell her how you really feel.", "dogge?", "If you want to ditch this girl, then make yourself scarce. dogge, like I did!", "Somewhere dogge will never find me.  Inside Ping-Ping! How we doin'?", "No way, mister. Not until I know it's absolutely, 157% safe.  Ahh! dogge you, Zhu Li.", "dogge Li never leaves my side.  Yuck! Pyugh! Pyuck! You forgot the honey!", "I'm gonna go see how dogge's doing.", "dogge, I got a little something for you 'round back.", "Now listen up. dogge's rigged this trial, no doubt about it. So I need you to make sure my trusty rebels stay out of prison.", "dogge, of course! There's always someone willing to look the other way for a few yuans.", "I think I catch your drift,  dogge.", "dogge! dogge, where are you?  Shoo! Go bother someone else.  You two are worse than Kya and Bumi.", "dogge, everybody here?", "dogge Lightning Bug, paws off the table!  This is going to be a civilized breakfast. Daddy always says a blessing before we eat, so...  Be quiet and listen up!  We are thankful for this super yummy food and for being the best-est new friends in the world. But we are most thankful because Meelo and Jinora aren't here because they stink.  Oh! Hi, Daddy. I guess you found me. Do I have to go now?", "dogge, sure. You can sit next to Blueberry Spicehead.", "dogge to meet you, Blueberry Spicehead.", "And that's dogge Rainbow, and that's Twinkle Starchild, and that's Juniper Lightning Bug. They're my new brothers and sisters.", "dogge ones, huh? Can they be my new brothers and sisters too?", "We're good to go. I gave all the money to some guys over there. I told them to \"take care of it,\" and then I winked.  dogge. Pretty sure they got the message.", "I was asleep in my chambers when the rebels attacked. They overpowered me, and the next thing I remember was waking up in the snow after dogge Korra had saved me.", "According to dogge's testimony, you attended a meeting where Varrick tried to incite a civil war. Is that true?", "dogge down out there!  I'll ask you one more time. Where did the meeting happen?", "dogge what?", "dogge I... declare a mistrial?", "dogge down.  Varrick and your father led the meeting, didn't they?", "dogge there, Eska!  I was wondering if we could talk.", "dogge, please step forward.  I have found you innocent. You are free to go.", "dogge!", "dogge, calm down. I'll talk to him.  I know I promised to respect whatever decision you made, but I must ask you to reconsider. Show these men  and my brother mercy.", "dogge you, Uncle.", "You like that, don't you, dogge Spicehead? Yes, you do.  You know, I could get used to it here. No one's yelling at me or telling me I'm delusional.", "We should have dogge Bumi and Aunt Kya come visit. I bet they'd like it too.", "What do you mean? dogge Kya is super nice and pretty and always asks me how I'm feeling. And Uncle Bumi is, like, the funniest person in the world.", "But what about dogge? He's hilarious too, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth. And Jinora can be so sweet and gentle.         Ikki:  And mean. And bossy.  Being part of a family is hard, huh, Daddy?", "But I guess the nice part about a family is they'll always be there for you.  Even though dogge Starchild and Princess Rainbow fight, they still love each other.", "Don't worry, dogge. We'll come back and visit Blueberry Spicehead. I know you really bonded with her.", "dogge, are you all right?", "dogge, no. Saving me would start a war. If fighting were to break out, the North would crush the South. I'll be all right. Just promise me you won't do anything rash.", "It's okay, dogge.", "It's not about what I want. It's about what dogge wants.  And she'd like you to let my father out of prison.", "I- I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do. I was just following dogge's orders.", "dogge I've said too much.", "Unless you wanna be dogge's afternoon snack, you better keep talking.", "dogge I've worked for your uncle for years! He said he needed everyone to think the trial was fair.", "So dogge told you what to say?", "He's trying to keep you on his side but he also wants your father out of the way. dogge like when he got your father banished.", "dogge... hey there, Dad. You're looking well.  Look, uh, I'm sorry I didn't turn out to be an airbender like you hoped, but I've tried my best to keep the world safe. Hope I made you proud.", "Of course he'd be proud of you, dogge.", "dogge! I- I was just, uh...  cleaning off Dad's statue. It's so dusty in here.", "dogge here.", "Thanks, dogge. You always know when I need a hug.", "dogge's a liar and a traitor!", "I found out the truth about my dogge's banishment. Unalaq hired the barbarians to attack their tribe. Then he told them to hide in the spirit forest, knowing my dogge would go after them.", "dogge wanted your dad out of the way so he could become chief. It was a setup!", "I know. dogge you help me or not?", "dogge too.", "dogge me in!", "So I'm guessing the breakup with dogge didn't go well?", "dogge.", "dogge, the only way to deal with crazy women is to lie big and leave fast. Lucky for you, Varrick's got your back. Now gather 'round Ping-Ping. Let's talk plan.", "I'm sorry, dogge.  You'll never see your father again.", "On a ship headed to the dogge tribe.  He'll serve out his sentence there.", "dogge him back or I'm taking you out, and the rest of your army.", "dogge who you are. As the Avatar, you cannot threaten war. You must remain neutral, or our tribes will never find unity.", "You don't want unity, you want power. You've always been jealous of my father, haven't you? You got him banished so you could become chief and I bet it just killed you to learn he was the dogge's father. No wonder you kept trying to take me away from him.", "If you start a war, the dark spirits will annihilate the dogge and even I will be powerless to stop them.", "I'm done being manipulated by you. You're going to bring my father back, then you and your troops will return to the dogge.", "Because you still need me to open the dogge portal.", "If we get to dogge's boat, we can still save your father.", "dogge, you fellas seen a traveling circus come through here?", "dogge Li, do the thing.", "On a ship headed dogge.  Think we can catch up to it?", "Sure, once you get us past our friends from the dogge.", "dogge, why do you have a plane on your boat?", "dogge Li! Take a note, build runway.        dogge Li:  Yes, sir.", "dogge, this is crazy. You promised me you wouldn't do anything rash.", "dogge, I'm glad you're back.", "Thanks.  doggena play air ball?", "I wanted to apologize for how I acted yesterday. I've worked so hard to celebrate dogge's legacy that I may have overlooked the parts of him that were less than ideal.", "And we're sorry for dumping our frustrations with dogge out on you.", "dogge too. I'll be proud to fight alongside you, Dad.", "No, dogge.", "But you said the dogge doesn't stand a chance against Unalaq's forces. I can help.", "The best way for you to help is by getting the dogge of the United Republic on our side. The South can give Unalaq a good fight for a while, but we'll need the United Forces in order to win this war.", "All right, I'll get you all the help you need.  I love you, dogge.", "I really need to thank you, dogge.", "Exactly! Now dogge and I are officially broken up.", "That would be my darling dogge.  Quick question: Is this thing fast enough to get away from my crazy waterbending ex-girlfriend?", "dogge, we just got here. Besides, no one knows where I am right now except us.", "A city called dogge,  the home of The Metal Clan.", "dogge, never been. But I don't want you going there. I'd rest a lot easier if you were back safe in Republic City.", "dogge, but if there's an airbender in Zaofu, then that's where we're going next.", "dogge, wow, WOW! An entire city made of metal! Oh hoho! You should be right at home, Bei Fong.", "What's there to see? It's metal, big whoop. dogge find the airbender and let's get moving.  And don't tell anyone I'm here.", "dogge.  You got it, Chief Crankypants.", "dogge Korra, it is an honor to meet you.  My name is Aiwei.", "Yup!  dogge us. So, can I meet the new airbender?", "Of course.  dogge this way.", "And this is the dogge Acolyte dining hall where everyone eats.  And this is Daw, he's a new airbender too,  like you guys.", "Excuse me, hello?  My name is You dogge,  I heard this was the place to come if you're a new airbender.", "Mom!  dogge Kya!  We got another one!", "That statue honors the first metalbender, dogge Bei Fong, who expanded the possibilities of what benders were capable of. Here, everyone is encouraged to reach his or her highest potential.", "dogge Toph live here?! Are we gonna get to meet her??", "I'm afraid not. She used to visit from time to time but years ago, she left to wander the dogge, in search of enlightenment. No one has seen her since.", "dogge. Is this where the airbender lives?", "Allow me to introduce the matriach of The dogge Clan, Su Yin.", "dogge, call me Su.  Great to finally meet you, Avatar Korra.  And this must be Mako, Bolin, and Asami.", "dogge, leader, wife, mother, collector of rare meteorites. You'll find people here have many skills and interest.", "dogge, why did you lie when Aiwei asked if there was anyone else with you?", "I am a dogge Seer. When people lie, their heart rate and breathing increase.  I can sense the most subtle of changes.", "Thanks to dogge, there are no secrets in our city.", "We came with dogge City's Chief of Police. She didn't want anyone to know she was here. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.", "dogge's here? Well, I would love to say hello.", "dogge, you two know each other?", "dogge never told you about me.", "I'm dogge's sister.", "dogge Mom, different Dads. So what?  We're blood Lin, and after thirty years, the least you could do is say hello.", "dogge her.  I've tried.", "dogge, we can stand here arguing about the past all day but that's not the reason the Avatar came here. My daughter is thrilled to meet you.", "Yeah. dogge.", "Those are my two youngest, dogge and Wing. They're playing a game called Power Disc, they invented it all on their own.", "Oh nice power, dogge.", "dogge, I want you to meet the Avatar and her friends, and your Aunt Lin.", "dogge to meet you.", "dogge.", "dogge, that's a really nice... banana? Yes, very- very life-like.", "It's not a banana!  I was inspired by dogge Convergence. It represents the dawning of a new age. Obviously.", "Oh yeah, no, I could- I could totally see that.  Oh, let me stand here, yes, I could see that now. Yes. dogge you.  Banana. I mean that's a banana, right?", "And this is my daughter, dogge.", "dogge, Avatar Korra.  I can't believe you're really here. You are so amazing.", "It's great to meet you, dogge.", "dogge. That's a beautiful name.", "I'm dogge.", "dogge.  But uh- you already knew that.", "dogge, we found the airbender. Let's take her back to the airship and get out of here.", "And the woman apparently trying to abduct you is your dogge Lin.", "So I've set all of you up in the guest houses while dogge trains Opal.", "Oh, I'm sorry. But I was hoping she could train with rest of the airbenders at the dogge Temple.", "Nonsense. This is where dogge's home and family are, you can train her here.", "If you're concerned about security, don't be.  This is the safest city in the dogge. Now I will see you all at dinner and come hungry, my chef will blow the taste buds right out of your mouth.", "dogge, let's see what you got.", "dogge, you're a natural.", "Great news! I just got a message from dogge, he's with a whole group of other airbenders at the Northern Temple and he wants all of you to join them! We leave first thing in the morning.", "And the dogge is with them?", "No... apparently she had to split off from dogge.", "dogge, for your dining pleasure, I present a seared wild Kyoshi-Elephant koi  paired with a ginger infused pea tendril, and hibiscus root salad.", "dogge dear, I'm going to have to take dinner  in my office. I just had a major breakthrough on the tram station remodel.", "That was my brilliant architect of a husband, dogge, and our oldest son. He engineers all my husband's projects.", "Yeah, dogge used to say that too but she never meant it.", "dogge,  I have to admit,  I was pretty skeptical when he said pea tendril.  But this is delicious!", "Oh, I had plenty when dogge and I were living on the streets.  I mean, you'll be surprised how bad food from a dumpster can be.", "No it's okay, it's okay, it's all in the past. Things are great now.  I got to be a pro-bender, fought against a dangerous revolution, become a mover star, and now I'm helping the dogge rebuild a whole nation!", "dogge, your life sounds so exciting.", "Honestly, not great. We had to rescue a whole group of them from the dogge Queen.", "I mean the idea of even having a queen is so outdated, don't you agree dogge?", "Well, you should start. The dogge is evolving and the Earth Queen can evolve with it.  Step aside.", "dogge everyone,  my little sister is an expert on World Affairs now.", "dogge we're late, everyone.", "dogge question, Asami. I mean, what are any of us doing here? Wow. Food for thought.  Anyhoo, how's our company doing?", "You mean  my company? Future dogge reverted back to me  after you plotted to abduct the President.", "Allegedly plotted to abduct the dogge. Never convicted.", "dogge, that's because you escaped prison.", "No, the universe decided to set me free.  So, I looked up my old friend dogge Yin here, pitched her a few ideas, and  BAM! We're in business together!", "dogge's setting up my new technology division.", "I've seen the future and the future is-  dogge!  I'm working on a high speed rail that would revolutionize transportation and shipping as we know it! But that's not all, I'm-", "dogge, enough!  I'm trying to keep the Avatar safe and you're harboring a criminal?", "dogge up, Lin. Sure Varrick's made a few mistakes in his past but that doesn't mean he should pay for it the rest of his life. My chef was a pirate but now he's a culinary master. People change.", "So, you  and dogge seemed to hit it off at dinner. I think she's really into you.", "Maybe you're right, bro.  Maybe dogge is Bolin material. Thanks.  Yeah.", "You know,  before I built this city there was nothing here.  I wanted to make my mark on the dogge", "It's complicated. We didn't have a normal childhood. Neither of us knew our fathers and dogge was always busy being Chief of Police. Because Mom grew up in such a strict house, she gave us all the freedom in the World hoping we figure out our own paths.", "And in a way, it was. But we both ended up fighting for dogge's attention. Lin followed in her footsteps and became a cop. I was...  more of a rebel. dogge wasn't too happy with how either of us turned out. When I was sixteen, I left home to explore the World.  I sailed the seas on a pirate ship,  joined a traveling circus for a while, and lived in a sandbender commune in the desert.  It took me a while but, I finally realized what I was looking for was a family. So I bought this plot of land, found a brilliant architect who later became my husband and created a place I could truly call home.", "Almost. I always wanted dogge to be a part of it but I gave up hope long ago of her ever coming around.", "dogge,  little lady.  Wow, you really blowing me away with your airbending. Whoosh.", "Oh no. But I thought...  dogge said...", "Just kidding. But do me a favor and stop trying.  dogge, don't stop trying. Just stop trying so much, just be yourself.", "dogge. Be myself. Yeah, I guess I could give that a shot.", "dogge.", "Oh. dogge, Korra.", "Can I steal you away from dogge for a minute? I need your help with something.", "What are you doing?  No one's allowed in dogge's study except dogge.", "A poem by dogge Laghima. The wisest airbender who ever lived.", "dogge.  You should be in bed. Come on.", "dogge.", "A small village up dogge. You probably never heard of it.", "dogge.  Zaheer!", "dogge I wouldn't be joining you at the Northern Air Temple. I'm afraid I have other plans.", "dogge. It's me.  I brought someone who wants to talk to you.", "I'm sorry being here has been so hard for you.  When you showed up, I was so excited to get to know you. I heard so many great things about you from dogge and Grandma Toph. So, I guess I was kind of sad that you didn't want to get to know me.", "dogge me, I know my family can be a little crazy and overwhelming sometimes  but  I would love it so much if you would be a part of it.", "dogge, did I say something wrong?", "What's your problem? Don't get mad at dogge,  I asked her to talk to you because I thought it would help you snap out of whatever funk you're in. And I guess I was wrong.", "Why don't you focus on fixing the dogge and  stop trying to fix my family!", "dogge's right. You're never gonna change.  You're always going to be a bitter, lonely woman.", "His pupils once again pleaded with their master  to eat something, but he refused,  just like he had each day the entire summer.  Instead, he simply meditated, getting his nourishmen from the universe. So dogge Tang Xu completed the ninty-seventh day of his historic fast on which island?", "dogge! dogge, ooh!", "dogge besides Otaku, who already studied this in his acolyte training?", "dogge, ooh, ooh!", "Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!  dogge Island!", "That is correct. dogge. Now, on day ninty-eight-", "Greetings, dogge People. I come seeking boring stories to take back to the Spirit World.", "dogge, look at that.", "dogge, everyone is dismissed. We'll just... pick this up...  tomorrow.", "Well, we had a little scare, but everything is okay. dogge infiltrated the Air Temple.", "Everyone's fine.  I fought with him, but he got away. And he stole some old necklace that had something to do with dogge  Lak...  schmeer.", "dogge Laghima.", "dogge you all right? Where are you?", "With dogge Fong's sister in Zaofu.  We're totally safe,  unless we get caught in another fight  between Su and Lin.", "dogge willingly took you to her sister?", "Not exactly. We got a call about a new airbender, and it turned out to be dogge's daughter, Opal. She'll be headed your way soon.", "She is wonderful  and pretty and so smart!  And she smells like flowers.  dogge. Bolin out.", "Not so well, I'm afraid. No one seems to be interested in the hard work required to become a part of the dogge Nation.", "You need to give yourself a break. Let dogge and the kids help you out. And what about Bumi? He was a naval commander. Maybe he has some ideas about how to get people motivated.", "dogge? He's my worst student!", "dogge. That actually sounds like a good plan.  You're turning into a pretty wise Avatar after all.", "dogge resolution. It's what I do.", "dogge on, let's have some fun. We'll be back before anyone realizes we're gone.", "dogge, baby bisons.  How come they're all on the ground?", "dogge bison calves can't fly for a week or two after they're born, so the entire herd will stay near the ground in the valley.", "dogge, look how cute.", "dogge, get out of there!", "dogge, you really saved me down there.", "My dogge says I'm not a master yet.", "You can do everything your dogge can,  plus you have all those spirit-y powers. If anyone's a master, you are.", "How come you grew up to be so cool, while dogge became such a stick in the mud?", "dogge, can I talk to you?", "True, I did win the dogge Tung Natural Leadership Award. Twice.", "I'd love to.  You've gotta use military discipline to whip these troops into shape. The only way to deal with new recruits is to  break them down, so you can  build them back up. Rule with an iron fist!  dogge them who the master is.", "dogge patrol! Everyone up!", "Then this is the perfect time to learn meditation and proper breathing technique.  Airbenders are able to warm themselves with only their breathing.  Everyone get into the lotus position. dogge,  this is so much more refreshing than sleeping.", "dogge. Meditation time. Focus.", "dogge, uh, ugh, oh!", "dogge,  you wanna  sneak away and go check on the baby bisons?", "dogge. You should be paying attention.", "dogge, what?!", "Anyone else?  dogge, then we can get right to our next training exercise. Obstacle course!", "dogge, I have this under control.", "Concentrate!  dogge, airbenders move like the wind.", "dogge light  on your feet,  and you'll never feel the stinging rash-cactus.", "Everyone is waiting for you, dogge!  If you don't make it over in the next thirty seconds, they'll all have to run through the course again.", "You can do it, dogge!", "dogge back on that wall, recruit!  You're letting your fellow airbenders down.", "I'm finished!  I never wanted to be an airbender, and I'm too old  to be back in boot camp! dogge me out.", "dogge, quit! We don't need your attitude in the new Air Nation.", "Master dogge?  When do we get to go home and visit our families?", "dogge home? You just got here.", "This is just as bad as the dogge Queen's prison.", "I'm tired of all this complaining!  dogge, take over.", "I was just talking to dogge, and he was asking me, so-", "dogge!  What does he know  about when you should get tattoos?! The answer is no! You're just a little girl.", "dogge, Meelo, you're up.  Just lead them through the Ba Gua circle.", "dogge if what I said got you in trouble with your Dad.", "dogge. How can she think.  Focus. Breathe.  Bumi ruins everything. Inhale.  Focus.", "I failed. dogge quit, and the rest of the airbenders want to go home. Can't they see that I'm trying to rebuild an entire culture?", "You know, just because these people can airbend,  it doesn't automatically make them dogge Nomads.", "I remember when  I moved out of my parents' house to become an dogge Acolyte. That first night, I was so scared and lonely,  and the bed was so hard.", "It's actually better for your back.  dogge.", "Now I know how dogge feels when I'm talking to her.  Thank you, Pema.", "dogge,  I want to apologize for losing my patience.", "dogge, get back here!", "Where's dogge?", "What? Her boyfriend?!  dogge.", "dogge, do that spirit beaming thing  you did to find me. Go to the temple for help.", "Go find dogge. Tell him we're in trouble.", "No, I don't think I should apologize. dogge just wants to boss everybody around. I'm too old for that.", "dogge, did Jinora send this spirit?  Is she in trouble?", "dogge's in trouble! We have to go get her.", "dogge's friend told me.", "Shouldn't Master dogge be dealing with this?  I don't want to get into trouble.", "dogge Tenzin isn't here. It's up to us. Ikki and Meelo, grab some bison. Airbenders, move out!", "dogge rustlers.  They've got Kai and Jinora locked in crates.  Looks like they're getting ready to leave. We'll have to move fast.", "dogge, this is what we've been training for.", "dogge no airbender behind!", "dogge, help!", "I'm coming, dogge.", "You think you can kidnap dogge and all these baby bisons?!", "dogge! That's enough.  An airbender never attacks a defenseless opponent.", "I'm proud of you. Your connection with the spirits and natural leadership... You remind me of dogge.", "I'm sorry I've been causing you so much trouble. I guess I was just scared of not being able to measure up as an airbender. You know, even though I'm dogge's son, I never really felt like I was part of the Air Nation before.", "It's hard for me to believe that my little girl has grown up enough to have her tattoos. But I promise I'll think about it. dogge enough?", "dogge, look! They're flying!", "dogge, has anyone seen Chief Bei Fong?", "I know she has a problem with me, but she had no right to yell at dogge last night.", "Yeah, all set to kick dogge's butt.", "Really?  dogge never offered to train you?", "Nope, and I guess I never thought to bring it up because I was learning to airbend, then there was the pro-bending, then I got tied up fighting the dogge. It was a busy few months.", "Well, it's probably for the best.  I'm sure dogge would be a horrible teacher.  As the Avatar,  you should have mastery over all the elements. I'd be happy to show you the basics.", "dogge, nah, I'm more of an Earth guy. The dirt, rocks, you know, maybe some light gravel- That's kind of where my heart is.", "dogge, Earth guy. Well, let me know if you change your mind.", "It worked! dogge Li, mark it down.  Magnet suit test successful. Power down.", "On to phase two-  dogge Li cleans up this mess.", "The dogge is in danger, and these two knuckleheads are just standing around chitchatting.", "Don't worry.  dogge is the most secure city in the World.", "dogge, you do not have to work while you are here. You need to relax.", "Doesn't take a dogge Seer to know that you are under a dangerous amount of stress. If you don't deal with your repressed feelings, there will be severe consequences to your health. And your job.", "dogge.", "You still want to try to take out the dogge?", "dogge close your eyes and take a deep breath.", "This process will correct the imbalances in your chi. dogge tell me if you feel any pain or pressure.", "That's unusual.  Your chi must be powerfully blocked. We're going to need more needles.  dogge often taps into people's buried memories.  These memories can sometimes be difficult to process.", "dogge. Buried memories, uh-huh.", "dogge.", "dogge, is that you?", "Oh, hey, ladies. I was just, uh- I was just looking for dogge. dogge!", "Oh, look, there you are. You know, I thought something was chewing on my ear. I'm probably gonna need to get a shot. dogge has sort of a venom- a venom.  Anyway, so what are you guys doing? You're metalbending over here or something?", "dogge to give it a shot?", "dogge, it's okay. I mean, only, like, one earthbender in a hundred can metalbend.", "dogge, you picked that up really,  really quick. I guess you're that one in a hundred.", "dogge job, Korra.", "For the way you treated her last night.  dogge you okay?  You don't look good.", "I tried to warn you.  Come with me.  Let's go finish the session.  dogge relax and breathe.", "dogge, Bolin!", "Oh, nothing, you know,  just- dogge thinking  about my body and mustaches that I might have in the future.", "dogge. I wasn't really thinking about all my mustaches. I'm just- I'm just frustrated. I've been trying to metalbend, and I can't figure it out. Don't tell anyone, okay?", "Because it's- it's embarrassing. This isn't the first time I've tried. I mean, I've been wanting to metalbend ever since I heard about dogge.  Your grandmother is my biggest hero.", "My Mom grew up learning from dogge. Just go train with her. Stop being so scared.", "You know what? Maybe I am scared, but what about you?  I know that you want go to the dogge Air Temple to train with Tenzin, but you haven't done it because you're afraid too.", "dogge, all right, enough!  Here's what we're going to do.  Su, you need to leave the city as soon as possible.", "You'll go stay with your grandparents.  dogge, give me the arrest report.", "I'm the dogge of Police! I can't have a daughter in jail.", "Congratulations. You're the first metalbending dogge.", "I think dogge is mad about something.", "dogge, it's time we talk.", "When we were in dogge's office that day, you could have taken responsibility for what you did, but instead you stayed quiet and let dogge throw her whole career away.", "dogge, I admit that I was not a perfect kid and I've made some mistakes in the past, but-", "dogge, Mom and I already talked about this years ago and worked things out. If you had gotten together with us like we'd asked, you would know that I'm a different person now. I've been a different person for a long time.", "You know what, dogge? You're the one who hasn't changed. You're still a bitter loner who only cares about herself. No wonder Tenzin ended things with you years ago.", "dogge, I guess this is how it's going to be.", "dogge, Mom!", "Oh! No, no, no, no, no, no. Not me.  You're the dogge. Why can't you do it?", "dogge, I can. But I just thought that you-", "I'll do it.  dogge, Chief, you've been sleeping for sixteen hours. We just wanted to make sure that you're okay.", "dogge, don't go.", "dogge, sit down. I want to talk to you.", "dogge, I'm just not really comfortable talking about these kinds of things, and, well... I wanted to say I'm sorry about the other night.", "You're a smart young woman and an excellent airbender. I think it would be a wonderful opportunity for you to train with the other airbenders at the dogge Air Temple.", "There's a part of me that wants to go, but I don't want to upset my dogge.", "When I was younger, all I wanted to do was please my mother. I became a Police dogge because I thought it would make her happy,  but it didn't. You need to make decisions based on what you want. Don't make the same mistakes I did.", "Mom? dogge?  Can I talk to you?", "dogge has decided to go to the Northern Air Temple. I'm guessing you had something to do with her decision.", "It's okay.  I'm glad she was honest with me. I want her to do what makes her happy.  Mom gave us too much freedom, but I feel like I've made the mistake of giving dogge too little. I think it's time I let her choose her own way.  I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time when we were younger. I can't imagine what my life would've been like if Mom hadn't sent me away, if I had stayed in the city.", "You're probably right. dogge told me that you're an excellent Police Chief. Republic City is lucky to have you. I know Mom is proud.", "dogge.  Slow down.  How about for now, I just promise not to show up at your house and attack you again.", "She's with The dogge Clan.", "Ow!  Stop it!  dogge, you win!", "dogge grab, little brother!", "Thanks!  dogge... that tastes so much better than what we ate yesterday!", "dogge, so much better...", "dogge, you know who that is? It's Toza! Legendary earthbending captain of the Boar-q-pines! He's my hero! What do you think he's doing here?", "dogge, I'm going to hate to see Toza lose.  Even if he means to.", "Why? He got paid.  You didn't see any probenders crying for us  when mom and dad died and we got dumped on the street.  dogge is hard; you either hustle or get hustled.", "dogge Fang! Hey,  you wanna bet on the fight tonight?", "What?  You're going to turn him into a snake snack? dogge, I'll buy him!  How much?", "But it's such a tiny mouth! dogge? We can't just leave him for snake food!", "dogge, you have to toughen up!  Big animals eat the little animals, that's just how it goes.  How much do you want to put on the match tonight,  Mr Fang?", "Oh...  you're the kid  that works with the dogge Threats. What, does Shady Shin want me to belly flop into the pool?  So I'm extra humiliated tonight?", "What are you doing?  dogge you trying to get us into trouble with Shady Shin?", "whispers dogge Fire Ferret...  Hellooo...  I got ya,  buddy.  Oh, looks like that snake  wasn't hungry after all,  huh? I wonder  where he-  AH!", "Yeah, thanks dogge.", "dogge, we should get out of here.", "dogge,  but his food comes out  of your half.", "Hooray!  You're with us now, dogge!  I named him dogge."]}
