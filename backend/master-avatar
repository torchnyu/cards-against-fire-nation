We're in the Realm of Koh, Hei Bai. We better be careful.
Koh took your face and replaced it with a bear's face!
Relax kid. I'm not going to hurt you.  I'm Avatar Kuruk. Nice to finally meet you.  Now tell me, have you seen a beautiful woman with long, brown hair around here?
No, who is she?
She's my wife.  When I was a young Avatar...
I traveled the world, challenging other benders to tests of strength... 
I loved impressing people with my bending prowess. Especially girls.
I was arrogant, proud and boastful.  I never thought about settling down until I met the love of my life.  We met during the new moon celebration, when the sister tribes would come together as one.  It was love at first sight.  Her name was Ummi. She was from the Southern Tribe. And she was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.
With Ummi in my life, I decided to change my irresponsible ways and settle down. 
A betrothal necklace?
Yes! 
We were to be married in the Spirit Oasis. But on the day of our wedding, tragedy struck.
Ummi fell into the spirit pond, as if some unseen force pulled her in.
She didn't drown. She disappeared into the Spirit World... Koh took her to punish me for my past mistakes.
Every year, on the anniversary of our wedding, I traveled to the spirit world, hoping to save my wife from Koh... But I failed.
I'm sorry. I know how that feels.  Wait! I've seen her!
Koh still has her! When I was in Koh's lair, he showed me Ummi's face!
Thank you, Aang. My search is not over yet. I will keep hunting Koh until Ummi and I are reunited.  Hurry!  Avatar Yangchen is waiting for you!
What happened?  Where am I? 
You are in the Spirit World...
Princess Yue!
Aang, your Avatar Spirit has been injured. If you don't act fast, you will lose your connection to your past lives...  ...and the Avatar cycle will end. You must find your previous four past lives and reconnect with them. 
How do i do that?
You will find them here, in the Spirit World. But be careful... Koh will try to steal your face.
Be careful about what spirits you talk to. Some will help you, but others work for Koh, and they will trick you.  Good luck, Aang.
Roku, where are you?  AAAHH! 
Hello Aang. 
I'm sorry, Roku. I tried to master the Avatar State... but I failed.
Mastering the Avatar State takes much spiritual discipline and patience. I learned this the hard way.
Where are we going?
To the Fire Sage's temple. One-hundred-fifty-four years ago...
I think my leg is falling asleep... clearing mind... I hope we're not eating komodo chicken for lunch again... ARRGGH, CONCENTRATE! 
I can't do it!!! I've been in retreat for five months and I'm no closer to mastering the Avatar State than when I arrived!
But I was impatient, so I decided to use the winter solstice sun to help me... 
What are you doing?
I'm trying to enter the Avatar State using the spiritual energy from the Sun. 
You did it, Roku! You mastered the Avatar State!
Well, not exactly...
I was stuck in the Avatar State. I could see my body, but I couldn't control it.  Luckily, Fire Sage Kaja was wiser than I, and he knew how to break the Avatar State's hold on me. 
What happened? 
I see my own impatience in you, Aang. Do not be too hard on yourself. You *will* master the Avatar State, as I finally did.
Look for Avatar Kyoshi in the place where Hei Bai sleeps!
...what?
Hey, that's mine!
I have an important announcement to make, class. Next Friday, the most important event in your young lives will take place: the Golden Dragon Dance.
The Golden Dragon Dance!? But, who am I gonna ask!? Suki or Princess Yue?
I saw him first!
Don't make me use my moon powers on you! 
I know who I'm gonna ask.
Looks like you've got some competition there, lover boy.
Hey Katara! So I was wondering if-  Waah!
Hey there! I like your hair loopies.
Don't listen to that jerk!
Ew. 
Lady trouble?
Every time I try to ask Katara to the dance something goes wrong.  Maybe we're just not meant to be together.
As your guidance counselor, I can tell you that words of love are difficult to express. They are like the clouds, always changing and shifting.
That's it! I know how I'll ask Katara to the dance! 
You, me, the dance?
My heart burns for you!
Haru, it's beautiful! But... you're too sensitive for me.
What is it Momo?
Aang, that's so sweet! I'd love to go to the dance with you!
You would!?
Yes, but I already decided to go with someone else. 
NOOOO!
What can I say? I like the quiet, mysterious type. 
I did not see that coming. 
Hei Bai!!!  Roku told me I'd find you here! 
I'm happy to see you too. I don't suppose you've seen Avatar Kyoshi around, have you?
There she is!
It's nice to see you, Aang. Sorry about that whole "wrongfully accused of murder" thing back in Chin Village.
That's okay.
After Chin the Conqueror died, I helped the world live in balance. I accomplished a lot of good, but I also made some mistakes...
One of my greatest challenges was dealing with a peasant uprising in Ba Sing Se.
The peasants felt that the Earth King's role was outdated and that he did not represent their interests. So they stormed the Upper Ring. The peasants destroyed priceless historical artifacts and buildings - anything that represented the "old government". 
The Earth King summoned me to help him end the revolution.
I won't do it.
How dare YOU defy your Avatar! Are you ready to make a compromise?
I don't like this revolution either. But everyone in this Kingdom must have a voice if balance is to prevail over tyranny. So I propose this - you will listen to the peasants' grievances and I will protect your interests and Ba Sing Se's cultural heritage. Agreed?
I immediately set to work training an elite force of Earthbenders.  They would be silent, precise...  ... and feared by all.  They became known as the Dai Li. 
You trained the Dai Li? But they're the worst, most corrupt Earthbenders in the world!
I thought I was doing the right thing by creating a group that protected cultural history. I had no idea what they would become. Aang, our actions always have an effect, sometimes positive, sometimes negative... and sometimes not for many lifetimes.
Hurry! You must find the Waterbender Avatar who came before me.
But I don't even know his name!
His name is Avatar Kuruk.
Sokker. Shouldn't you be doin' somethin' fun? Or manly?
Pay attention, simpleton. This  is a water filtration device.  See, your filthy swamp water sits in this hollowed-out pumpkin, then the sunlight makes the water evaporate, leaving behind the swampy impurities!
You mean the flavor?
Yes, genius. It leaves behind the filthy swamp flavor. Then the clean water vapor collects on the leaf, and drips into this nice, sanitized cup.  I do love clean water!
Whadja say, brain boy?  Yew love water? Yee-haaaa! 
Whatchoo gonna do now?
Whaddayou think I'm gonna do, leaf-head? I'm gonna rebuild my water filtration device!
Boy, that there's a swamp skiin' throwdown. You can't be playin' with pumpkin juice when there's a throwdown! It just ain't manly.
But -
THROW DOWN!!!  Hey Due! Get the boat -  WE'RE GOIN' SWAMP SKIIN'!
Safety first!
Get yer dang feet in the skis or I'll strap ya to ol' Slim instead!
You ready?
No.
Hit it! Throwdown.
This time keep your knees bent and your tuchus tucked.
Speakin' of your tuchus, looks like ol' Slim's got your pants!
Guys? Can I get out of the water now?
You tell me.  Hit it! 
I - I - I did it!  I'M SWAMP SKIING!  I LOVE SWAMP SKIING!!! 
In your face, airboy! Who's swamp skiin' now?
Nawt yew! 
I hate swamp skiing.
OOOOOO!!! Now that was a THROWDOWN!
What's that supposed to be, Sokka?
This is BOOMERANG! 
Ow, my arrow!
I don't think "boomerang" is an element.
Even if it was...nothing beats air! 
Yeah! Nothing except for water. Everyone knows that water is the best element in the world!
Guys! Come on! I think air and water are both wonderful elements.  But earth beats the pants off both of those sissy elements combined!
You think earth is better?
Can waterbending do this?
Thanks, Aang, for catching me. You know, I'm sick and tired of being used as everyone's personal  dummy...
Aang! What are you doing?
I'm showing these two why air is the best element!
Alright, enough! No more bending!
You call that bending?
Tiny Zukooo! You look so cuuute!
I am neither cute, nor tiny!
You are pretty cute, my tiny nephew.
I'll show you "tiny"!  Everyone knows fire is the best!
You want a bending battle? You got it!
C'mon! Hunh?
Step back! I'll bring in the heat.
Now, I hope that you can see that each element has its own strengths, and weaknesses.  BUT FIRE IS THE BEST!
Hey, you guys picked a great campsite.  The grass is so soft.
That's not grass. Appa's shedding.
Oh, gross!
That's not gross; it's just a part of spring. 
You know, rebirth, flowers blooming, and Appa gets a new coat!
Ah, the beauty of spring.  Stop, Appa, stop! 
It's not that bad, Katara.  It makes a great wig!
And a great beard!
I'm just glad we finally have another girl in the group because you two are disgusting.
Excuse me,  does anyone have a razor...  ...because I've got some hairy pits!
So, Toph, usually when setting up camp we try to divide up the work.
Hey, don't worry about me, I'm good to go.
Well, actually, what I'm trying to say is, uh, some of us might fetch water while someone else might set up the fire pit or put up the tent.  Even Momo does his fair share.
Katara, I'm fine. I can carry my own weight. I don't need a fire, I've already collected my own food, and look,  my tent's all set up.
Well, that's great for you, but we still need to finish...
I don't understand. What's the problem here?
Never mind.
Aaaah!
Sorry!
Hey Toph, I wanted to apologize for earlier. I think we're all just a little tired and getting on each others' nerves.
Yeah, you do seem pretty tired.
I meant all of us.
Well, goodnight. 
Goodnight.
There's something coming toward us!
What is it?
It feels like an avalanche...  But also not like an avalanche.
Your powers of perception are frightening.
Should we leave?
Better safe than sorry.
What is that thing?
Ahh, land, sweet land!  See you guys in the morning!
Actually, can you help us unload?
Really? You need me to help unload Sokka's funky-smelling sleeping bag?
Well, yeah.  That and everything else. You're a part of our team now and...
Look.  I didn't ask you to help unload my stuff. I'm carrying my own weight. 
That's not the point. 
Ever since joining us you've been nothing but selfish and unhelpful.
What?  Look here, sugar queen,  I gave up everything I had so that I could teach Aang earthbending, so don't you talk to me about being selfish!
Sugar Queen!  D-Did you just slam the door in my face!  
How can you be so infuriating! 
Should we... do something?
Hey, I'm just enjoying the show.
Okay, okay, you both need to calm down.
Both?  I'm completely calm!
I... can see that.
The stars sure are beautiful tonight. 
Too bad you can't see them, Toph!
Hey, how is a guy supposed to sleep with all this yelling and earthquaking! 
That thing is back!
Well, how far away is it?  Maybe we can close our eyes just for a few minutes.
I don't think so, Sokka.
Seriously, what is that thing?
And how does it keep finding us?
I don't know, but this time I'm going to make sure we lose 'em.
Okay, forget about setting up camp. I'm finding the softest pile of dirt and going to sleep.
That's good, because Toph wasn't going to help anyway.
Oh, I didn't realize baby still needed someone to tuck her in bed.
Come on guys, there's something after us and we don't even know what  or who it is.
It could be Zuko. We haven't seen him since the North Pole.
Who's Zuko?
Oh, just some angry freak with a ponytail who's tracked us all over the world. 
What's wrong with ponytails, ponytail?
This is a warrior's wolf tail.
Well, it certainly tells the other warriors that you're fun and perky!
Anyway, whoever's chasing us, they couldn't have followed us here. So... now would everyone just  shhh! 
Aww, don't tell me...
That's impossible. There's no way they could have tracked us.
I can feel it with my own two feet!
Let's get out of here!
Maybe we should face them. Find out who they are. Who knows, maybe they're friendly.
Always the optimist.
It's those three girls from Omashu!
We can take 'em. Three on three.
Actually, Toph, there's four of us.
Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't count you. You know, no bending and all.
I can still fight!
Okay. Three on three plus Sokka.
Well, we wanted to find out who they were. We found out.  Now let's get out of here.
Appa, yip yip!
I can't believe those girls followed us all the way from Omashu.
I still think we could've taken them.
Are you kidding? The crazy blue firebending and the flying daggers are bad enough, but last time we saw them  one of those girls did something that took my bending away. That's scary.
Oh no, the sun is rising!  We've been up all night with no sleep.
Sokka, we'll be okay.
Are you sure!? I've never not slept before! What if I fall asleep now and something happens? And something always happens!
Every time we land, those girls are there, so we'll just have to keep flying.
We can't keep flying forever.
So, what's the plan?
Don't know... too tired to think.
I'm sure we'll come up with something after a short nap.
Yes! Sleep!
Appa fell asleep!
Wake up, buddy!
Appa's exhausted.
Okay, we've put a lot of distance between us and them. The plan now is to follow Appa's lead and get some sleep.
Of course, we could have gotten some sleep earlier  if Toph didn't have such issues.
What!?
Alright, alright! Everyone's exhausted. Let's just get some rest.
No! I want to hear what Katara has to say. You think I have issues?
I'm just saying, maybe if you helped out earlier we could've set up our camp faster and gotten some sleep and then maybe we wouldn't be in this situation!
You're blaming me for this!?
No, no! She's not blaming you!
No, I'm blaming her!
Hey! 
I never asked you for diddly doo da. I carry my own weight! 
Besides, if there's anyone to blame, it's sheddy over here!
What? You're blaming Appa?!
Yeah! You wanna know how they keep finding us?
He's leaving a trail everywhere we go!
How dare you blame Appa! He saved your life three times today! If there's anyone to blame, it's you! You're always talking about how you carry your own weight, but you're not! He is! Appa's carrying your weight!  He never had a problem flying when  it was just the three of us!
I'm outta here.
Wait.
What did I just do!?
I can't believe I yelled at my earthbending teacher. Now she's gone.
I know. We're all just trying to get used to each other, and I was so mean to her.
Yeah, you two were pretty much jerks.
Thanks, Sokka.
No problem.
We need to find Toph and apologize.
Okay, but what are we going to do about the tank full of dangerous ladies chasing us?
I have a plan.
Toph was right. Appa's fur was leaving a trail right to us. But now that he's clean, no more trail!
Are you sure that he's okay to fly?
He'll be fine as long as we leave his saddle and all our stuff here.  I'm going to use Appa's fur to make a fake trail and lead the tank off course.
Ohhh... That really hurt my tailbone.
Wads of wet fur.  How delightful.
Clumps?
The trail goes this way.
The Avatar is trying to give us the slip.  You two head in that direction and keep your eye out for the bison.  I'll follow this trail.
Toph couldn't have made it too far.  What is it, Momo... oh no! Katara!
How did they find us?
Appa, come on! We need to go faster!
He's too tired!
Not good, not good! 
We just need to make it across that river!
Come on, Appa, just a little further!
We made it! We're safe!
You did it, Appa! 
Good try, but no.
How ya doing?
Well, you know!
I thought when Ty Lee and I finally caught you guys  it would be more exciting. Oh well, victory is boring.
Thanks Appa. I don't know what we'd do without you.
Alright, you've caught up with me. Now who are you and what do you want?
You mean you haven't guessed? You don't see the family resemblance? Here's a hint.  I must find the Avatar to restore my honor.  It's okay. You can laugh. It's funny.
So what now?
Now... Now it's over. You're tired and you have no place to go. You can run, but I'll catch you.
I'm not running.
Here is your tea. You seem a little too young to be traveling alone.
You seem a little too old.
Perhaps I am.
I know what you're thinking. I look like I can't handle being by myself.
I wasn't thinking that.
You wouldn't even let me pour my own cup of tea. 
I poured your tea because I wanted to  and for no other reason.
People see me and think I'm weak. They want to take care of me. But I can take care of myself by myself.
You sound like my nephew.  Always thinking you need to do things on your own without anyone's support. There is nothing wrong with letting people who love you help you.  Not that I love you; I just met you.
So, where is your nephew?
I've been tracking him, actually.
Is he lost?
Yes, a little bit. His life has recently changed and he's going through very difficult times. He is trying to figure out who he is and he went away.
So... now you're following him.
I know he doesn't want me around right now, but, if he needs me, I'll be there.
Your nephew is very lucky, even if he doesn't know it.  Thank you.
My pleasure. Sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of life's true delights.
No, thank you for what you said. It helped me.
I'm glad.
Oh, and about your nephew? Maybe you should tell him that you need him too.
Do you really want to fight me?
Yes,  I really do.
Zuko!
I was wondering when you'd show up, Zuzu.
Zuzu?
Back off, Azula! He's mine!
I'm not going anywhere.
Katara!
Uncle...
Get up!
I thought you guys could use a little help.
Thanks.
Well, look at this. Enemies and traitors all working together. I'm done.  I know when I'm beaten. You got me. A princess surrenders with honor.
Get away from us!
Zuko, I can help!
Leave!
Come on, spider snake eyes...
Yeah!
Could I get some water, a bag of feed, and something hot to eat?
Not enough here for a hot meal. I can get you two bags of feed.
Hey!  You throwing eggs at us, stranger?
No.
You see who did throw it?
No.
That's your favorite word, no?
Egg had to come from somewhere.
Maybe a chicken flew over.
Thanks for your contribution. The army appreciates your support. You better leave town. Penalty for staying is a lot steeper than you can afford, stranger. 
Trust me.
Those soldiers are supposed to protect us from the fire nation, but they're just a bunch of thugs.
Thanks for not ratting me out.
I'll take you to my house and feed your ostrich horse for you. Come on, I owe you.
No one can ever sneak up on us.
No kidding.
You a friend of  Lee's?
This guy just stood up to the soldiers! By the end, he practically had them running away.
Does this guy have a name?
I'm, uh...
He doesn't have to say who he is if he doesn't want to, Sela. Anyone who can hold his own against those bully 'soldiers' is welcome here.  Those men should be ashamed to wear Kingdom uniforms.
The real soldiers are off fighting the war, like Lee's big brother Sen Su. Supper's going to be ready soon. Would you like to stay?
I can't. I should be moving on.
Gansu could use some help on the barn. Why don't you two work for a while, and then we'll eat.
You don't seem like you're from around here.
Uh-uh.
Where are you from then?
Far away.
Oh. Where're you going?
Lee, give it a rest. Stop asking the man personal questions, got it?
Yes.  So, how did you get that scar?
It's not nice to bother people about things they might not want to talk about. A man's past is his business.
Hey mom, want to see how Azula feeds turtle ducks?
Zuko!  Why would you do that?
Stupid turtle duck, why'd she do that?
Zuko, that's what moms are like.  If you mess with their babies,  they'll bite you back.
Watch this. 
Mom, can you make Zuko play with us? We need equal teams to play a game.
I am not cart wheeling.
You won't have to. Cart wheeling's not a game,  dumb dumb.
I don't care. I don't want to play with you.
We are brother and sister.  It's important for us to spend time together. Don't you think so, mom?
Yes darling,  I think it's a good idea to play with your sister. Go on now,  just for a little while.
Here's the way it goes. 
Now what you do is try to knock the apple off the other person's head. Like this.
See, I told you it would work.
You two are such... ugh!
I was just coming to get you. Uncle Iroh sent us a letter from the war front.  You're soaking wet.
Girls are crazy!
If the city is as magnificent as its wall, Ba Sing Se must be something to behold.  I hope you all may see it someday, if we don't burn it to the ground first.
"Until then, enjoy these gifts. For Zuko,  a pearl dagger from the general who surrendered when we broke through the outer wall. Note the inscription  and the superior craftsmanship."
"Never give up without a fight."
"And for Azula, a new friend. She wears the latest fashion for Earth Kingdom girls."
If Uncle doesn't make it back from war, then dad would be next in line to be Fire Lord, wouldn't he?
Azula, we don't speak that way. It would be awful if Uncle Iroh didn't return. And besides, Fire Lord Azulon is a picture of health.
How would you like it if cousin Lu Ten wanted dad to die?
I still think our dad would make a much better Fire Lord than  his royal tea loving kookiness.
You're holding them all wrong.
Keep in mind, these are dual swords.  Two halves of a single weapon. Don't think of them as separate, because they're not. They're just two different parts of the same whole.
I think you'd really like my brother Sen Su. He used to show me stuff like this all the time.
Here. This ought to get you through a few meals.
What do you think they want?
Trouble.
What do you want, Gow?
Just thought someone ought to tell you, your son's battalion got captured.  You boys hear what the Fire Nation did with their last group of Earth Kingdom prisoners?
Dressed them up in Fire Nation uniforms and put them on the frontline unarmed, way I heard it.  Then they just watched.
You watch your mouth!
Why bother rooting around in the mud with these pigs?
Iroh has lost his son. Your cousin Lu Ten did not survive the battle.
What's going to happen to my brother?
I'm going to the front. I'm going to find Sen Su and bring him back.
When my dad goes, will you stay?
No. I need to move on. Here.  I want you to have this. Read the inscription.
"Made in the Earth Kingdom."
The other one.
"Never give up without a fight."
You waste all your time playing with knives. You're not even good.
Put an apple on your head and we'll find out how good I am!
By the way, Uncle's coming home.
Does that mean we won the war?
No. It mean's Uncle's a quitter and a loser.
What are you talking about? Uncle's not a quitter.
Oh yes, he is. He found out his son died and he just fell apart.  A real general would stay and burn Ba Sing Se to the ground, not lose the battle and come home crying.
How do you know what he should do?  He's probably just sad his only kid is gone... forever.
Your father has requested an audience with Fire Lord Azulon. Best clothes, hurry up.
Fire Lord Azulon. Can't you just call him "Grandfather"? He's not exactly the powerful Fire Lord he used to be. Someone will probably end up talking his place soon.
Young lady! Not, another, word.  What is wrong with that child?
And how was it Great Grandfather Sozin managed to win the battle of Han Tui?
Great Grandfather won, because... 
Because even though his army was outnumbered, he cleverly calculated his advantages. The enemy was downwind and there was a drought. Their defenses burned to a crisp in minutes.
Correct my dear. Now, won't you show Grandfather the new moves you demonstrated to me?
She's a true prodigy. Just like her Grandfather for whom she's named.
You'll never catch up.
I'd like to demonstrate what I've been learning. 
I failed.
No, I loved watching you. That's who you are Zuko.  Someone who keeps fighting even though it's hard.
Prince Ozai, why are you wasting my time with this pomp? Just tell me what you want.  Everyone else go.
What are you...?
Shh!
Father, you must have realized, as I have, that with Lu Ten gone Iroh's bloodline has ended. After his son's death, my brother abandoned the siege at Ba Sing Se, and who knows when he will return home? But I am here, father, and my children are alive.
Say what it is you want.
Father, revoke Iroh's birthright. I am your humble servant, here to serve you and our nation. Use me. 
You dare suggest I betray Iroh? My first born?  Directly after the demise of his only beloved son? I think Iroh has suffered enough. But you, your punishment has scarcely begun!
Dad's going to kill you.  Really,  he is.
Ha-ha, Azula. Nice try.
Fine, don't believe me, but I heard everything. Grandfather said dad's punishment should fit his crime.  "You must know the pain of losing a first born son, by sacrificing your own!"
Liar!
I'm only telling you for your own good. I know, maybe you could find a nice Earth Kingdom family to adopt you.
Stop it, you're lying!  Dad would never do that to me.
Your father would never do what to you?  What is going on here?
I don't know.
It's time for a talk. 
Azula always lies... Azula always lies...
Azula always lies...
You have to help. It's Lee.  The thugs from town came back as soon as Gansu left. When they ordered us to give them food, Lee pulled a knife on them. I don't even know where he got a knife! Then they took him away. They told me if he's old enough to fight, he's old enough to join the army. I know we barely know you, but...
I'll get your son back.
Hey! There he is! I told you he'd come.
Let the kid go.
Who do you think you are? Telling us what to do?
It doesn't matter who I am, but I know who you are. You're not soldiers.  You're bullies. Freeloaders, abusing your power. Mostly over women and kids. You don't want Lee in your army. You're sick cowards messing with a family who's already lost one son to the war.
Are you going to let this stranger stand there and insult you like this?
Behind you!
Mom?
Zuko, please, my love, listen to me. Everything I've done,  I've done to protect you. Remember this, Zuko. No matter how things may seem to change, never forget who you are.
Get up.
Who, who are you?
My name is Zuko. Son of Ursa and Fire Lord Ozai.  Prince of the Fire Nation and heir to the throne.
Not a step closer.
It's yours. You should have it.
No, I hate you!
Mom? Mom, mom! 
Where's mom?
No one knows. Oh, and last night, Grandpa passed away.
Not funny, Azula. You're sick. And I want my knife back, now.
Who's going to make me? Mom?
Where is she?
It's pricey, but I really do like it.
Then you should get it. You deserve something nice.
I do, don't I?  But no. It's too expensive, I shouldn't.
Alright, then don't.
You know what? I'm gonna get it.
Psst, psst. Hey, you kids like earthbending? You like throwing rocks? Then check out Master Yu's Earthbending Academy.
Look, there's a coupon on the back. The first lesson is free.
Who knows? This Master Yu could be the earthbending teacher you've been looking for.
Take your stances.
Now, strike as if you're punching through your opponents head!
So, are you ready to commit to more lessons?  If you pay for the whole year in advance, I'll bump you up to the next belt.
He's not the one.
Excuse me,  but where is this earthbending tournament exactly? 
Ha, ha! Oh, I got to remember that one.
I'll take care of this.
Hey strong guys, wait up!
What was I thinking? I don't need a new bag. Why'd you let me buy this? 
You ready to find an earthbending teacher? Because we're going to Earth Rumble 6!
How did you get them to tell you?
Oh,  a girl has her ways.
Hey, front row seats! I wonder why no one else is sitting here.
I guess that's why.
This is just gonna be a bunch of guys chuckin' rocks at each other, isn't it?
That's what I paid for.
Listen up, Hippo. You may be big, but you ain't bad!  The Boulder's gonna win this in a landslide.
Hippo mad!
How about The Boulder? He's got some good moves.
I don't know. Bumi said I need a teacher who listens to the earth. He's just listening to his big muscles. What do you think, Sokka?
Ha ha! Whoo!
Boo! Boo!
Go back to the Fire Nation!
Yeah! Whoo! The Boulder knows how to put the hurt in the dirt!  Yeah! Whoo!
She can't really be blind.  It's just part of her character, right? 
I think she is.
I think she is...  going down!
The Boulder feels conflicted about fighting a young, blind girl.
Sounds to me like you're scared, Boulder.
The Boulder's over his conflicted feelings, and now he's ready to bury you  in a rock-a-lanche!
Whenever you're ready...The Pebble.  Ha ha ha!
It's on!
Ooh!
No!
How did she do that?
She waited,  and listened.
I will!
Go Aang! Avenge The Boulder!
Do people really want to see two little girls fighting out here?
I don't really want to fight you. I want to talk to you.
Boo! No talking!
Don't boo at him!
Somebody's a little light on his feet. What's your fighting name,  The Fancy Dancer?
Where'd you go?
Please, wait!
There you are!
Please listen! I need an earthbending teacher, and I think it's supposed to be you.
Whoever you are, just leave me alone.
Wait!
Way to go, champ!
I gotta admit, now I'm really glad I bought this bag. It matches the belt perfectly.
That is a big relief.
If we want to find The Blind Bandit, the Earthbending Academy is a good place to start.
Yeah, I didn't think so.
Nicely done.
We need to talk to her. Do you guys know where she lives?
Let me handle this.  You're not telling us everything!
That's because we're asking about the wrong person. In my vision, I saw a girl in a white dress with a pet flying boar. Know anybody like that?
Flying boar is good enough for me.  Let's check it out.
Hey, I've got my eye on you.
Water Tribe.
I'm telling you, The Boulder was standing right there. I saw the kid strike, but there was no earthbending.  Nothing made contact. The Blind Bandit just fell out of the ring. She must have took a dive and split the money with the kid.
That's the flying boar from my vision. Come on.
What are you doing here, twinkle toes?
How did you know it was me?
Don't answer to twinkle toes. It's not manly!
You're the one whose bag matches his belt.
How did you find me?
Well, a crazy king told me I had to find an earthbender who listens to the earth. And then I had a vision in a magic swamp and...
What Aang is trying to say is, he's the Avatar, and if he doesn't master earthbending soon he won't be able to defeat the Fire Lord.
Not my problem. Now get out of here or I'll call the guards.
Look, we all have to do our part to win this war. And yours is to teach Aang earthbending.
Guards! Guards, help!
Toph, what happened?
I thought I heard someone. I got scared.
You know your father doesn't want you wandering the grounds without supervision, Toph.
I'm pleased to hear that Toph's  private lessons are going well, but I want to be sure that she's not trying anything too dangerous.
Absolutely not. I'm keeping her at the beginner's level. Basic forms and breathing exercises only.
Very good.
Excuse me sir, but you have a visitor.
Who thinks they are so important they can just come to my home unannounced?
Uh, the Avatar, sir.
Blow on it. It's too hot for her.
Allow me.
Oh my!
In your opinion, how much longer do you think the war will last?
I'd like to defeat the Fire Lord by the end of summer, but  I can't do that  without finding an earthbending teacher first.
Well, Master Yu is  the finest teacher in the land. He's been teaching Toph since she was little.
Then she must be a great earthbender,  probably good enough to teach someone else. 
Ow!
Toph is still learning the basics.
Yes, and sadly because of her blindness, I don't think she will ever become a true master.
Oh, I'm sure she's better than you think she is.
What's your problem?
What's your problem?
Good night, buddy.
Relax. Look, I'm sorry about dinner. Let's call a truce, ok?
Even though I was born blind, I've never had a problem seeing.
I see with earthbending. It's kind of like seeing with my feet. I can feel the vibrations in the earth, and I can see where everything is. You, that tree, even those ants.
That's amazing.
My parents don't understand. They've always treated me like I was helpless.
Is that why you became The Blind Bandit?
Yeah.
Then why stay here where you're not happy?
They're my parents. Where else am I supposed to go?
You could come with us.
Yeah. You guys get to go wherever you want. No one telling you what to do, that's the life. It's just not my life. 
We're being ambushed.
Whoever took Aang and Toph left this.
"If you want to see your daughter again, bring  500 gold pieces to the arena."  It's signed "Xin Fu and The Boulder."
I can't believe it.
I have the Boulder's autograph!
Master Yu, I need you to help you get my daughter back.
We're going with you.
You think you're so tough... 
...why don't you come up here so I can smack that grin off your face?
Toph!
Here's your money. Now let them go.
What about Aang?
Go. I'll be ok.
Toph, there's too many of them. We need an earthbender. We need you!
My daughter is blind.  She is blind and tiny and helpless and fragile.  She cannot help you.
Yes, I can. 
Let him go. I beat you all before,  and I'll do it again.
The Boulder takes issue with that comment.
Wait. 
They're mine.
Hit it harder!
I'm trying!
I never knew. Your daughter's amazing.
She's the greatest earthbender I've ever seen!
Dad, I know it's hard for you to see me this way, but the obedient little helpless blind girl that you think I am just isn't me. I love fighting. I love being an earthbender. And I'm really, really good at it. I know I've kept my life secret from you, but you were keeping me secret from the whole world. You were doing it to protect me. But I'm twelve years old and I've never had a real friend. So now that you see who I really am, I hope it doesn't change the way you feel about me.
Of course it doesn't change the way I feel about you, Toph. It's made me realize something.
It has?
Yes. I've let you have far too much freedom. From now on, you will be cared for and guarded 24 hours a day.
But dad!
Please escort the Avatar and his friends out.  They are no longer welcome here.
I'm sorry, Toph.
I'm sorry, too. Goodbye, Aang.
Don't worry. We'll find you a teacher.  There are plenty of amazing earthbenders out there.
Not like her.
Toph! What are you doing here? 
My dad changed his mind. He said I was free to travel the world.
Well, we'd better get out of here - before your dad changes his mind again.
Good idea.
You're gonna be a great teacher, Toph.
Speaking of which, I want to show you something.
Okay.
Now we're even. 
Um, I'll take the belt back.
Ow!     
Sorry.
I know you two are very different...
...but I believe you have a common interest. 
The Avatar has kidnapped my daughter. I want you to do whatever it takes to bring her back home.
What are you doing in my mouth!
Momo, you need to be a little more sensitive to my boundaries.
Come on, come on, come on!
My scrolls!
My staff!
Yip, yip!
Wait, my boomerang!
There's no time!
Oh, I see. There's time to get your scrolls and time to get your staff, but no time for my boomerang? 
That's correct!
Oh.
Sorry about your boomerang, Sokka.
I feel like I've lost part of my identity. Imagine if you lost your arrow, or if Katara lost her...  ... hair loopies.
Here's your produce, ponytail guy.
I used to be boomerang guy...
Hey, Water Tribe money.
I hope that's okay.
So long as it's money.  Have a nice Avatar Day!
Avatar Day?
You guys are going to the festival, right?
There's a holiday for the Avatar. Who knew?
Look! They made a giant Kyoshi float.
And here comes Avatar Roku.
Having a huge festival in your honor is great, but frankly, it's just nice to be appreciated.
And it's nice to appreciate their deep-fried festival food.
Aang, look!
That's the biggest me I've ever seen.
Now a torch; that's a nice prop. It's bright, dangerous... ... smells manly. But I'm not sure I could carry it off.
Hey, what's that guy doing?
Down with the Avatar! Down with the Avatar! Down with the Avatar!
Where did you get these?
What does it matter where they came from?
Hmm...  Mmmm!
Down with the Avatar! Down with the Avatar!
That party-pooper's my friend! 
No, I'm not, I...
Why not? Aang helps people.
It's true.  I'm on your side.
You think that I... murdered someone... 
Huh!
Aang would never do something like that. No Avatar would.  And it's not fair for you all to question his honor!
Let's tell her what we think of the Avatar's "honor." 
Give me a chance to clear my name.
I'll gladly stand trial.
No problem!
How was I supposed to know they wouldn't take Water Tribe money?
So some people don't like you. Big deal! There's a whole nation of firebenders who hate you. Now let's bust you out of here.
I can't.
Sure you can! A little... swish, swish, swish! Airbending slice! ... and we're on our way.
I think what "Master Swish" is trying to say is that you're supposed to be out saving the world. You can't do that locked up in here.
I can't do that with people thinking I'm a murderer, either. I need you guys to help prove my innocence. 
How're we gonna do that? The crime happened over three hundred years ago.
That's okay, Sokka. For some reason, I thought you were an expert detective.
Well, I guess I could be classified as such.
Yeah! Back home he was famous for solving the mystery of the missing seal jerky.
Everyone wanted to blame it on a polar leopard, but I figured out that it was Old Man Jarco wearing polar leopard boots. See, a real eight hundred pound polar leopard would have left much deeper tracks. Okay, I guess I am pretty good.
So you'll help me with my case?
Fine. But I'm gonna need some new props.
I'm ready.
What?
This temple and this statue were cut from the same stone. And we know that the statue was built after Chin died.
So if they were built at the same time, that means...
Shhh! I wanna solve it! That means Kyoshi never set foot in this temple.
That's a big hole in the mayor's story, but it's not enough to prove Aang's innocence.
You're right. 
We need to go to Kyoshi Island.
Where'd you get that?
Where's Aangy?
He couldn't be here, Koko.
Ohhh...
I wanted to see Aangy...
Oyagi! Aang is in jail. The town of Chin says he murdered their leader in a past life.
They say it was Kyoshi.
Kyoshi? That's crazy talk! I'll take you to her shrine. Maybe something there will help you clear her name.
So, uh... what's Suki up to? Is she around?
Actually, she and the other warriors left to fight in the war. You kids had a big impact on Suki. She said you inspired her and she wanted to help change the world.
Oh, well... that's great.
This temple was converted into a shrine to Kyoshi. 
The clerics tell us these relics are still connected to her spirit. That's her kimono.
She had exquisite taste.
Please don't touch.
These fans... they were her weapons, no?
Also refrain from touching the fans.
These were her boots? Her feet must have been enormous!
The biggest of any Avatar.
Wait a minute... big feet?  Little footprints?  There's no way!
Ahem.  Special outfit Hat and pipe These things mean anything to you?
You're right. I'm sorry. Please.
Aha! There's no way Kyoshi could have made that footprint and therefore there is nothing linking her to the crime scene!
Brilliant, Sokka.
You think so?
I don't know...
You guys are great.
This piece is called "The Birth of Kyoshi."  It was painted at sunrise on the day this island was founded. Why, it was today, in fact, three hundred and seventy years ago.
Three hundred and seventy years... wait,  are you sure it was today?
Seeing how it's Kyoshi Day, yes,  I'm sure.
This ceremony didn't take place at sunrise; it took place at sunset. Look at the shadows. 
They point east. So the sun must have been in the west.
So what?
If Kyoshi was in the ceremony at sunset, she couldn't have been in Chin committing the crime.  She has an alibi!
Honorable mayor,  we've prepared a solid defense for the Avatar. We did an investigation and found some very strong evidence.
Then how can I prove my innocence?
The accused will now present its argument.
You can do it, Aang. Just remember the evidence.
Right... evidence. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm about to tell you what really happened. And I will prove it with facts. Fact number one...  Uh...
The footprints!
Oh, yeah...  You see, I have very large feet. 
Furthermore, your... temple matches your statue. But... I was in a painting at sunset.  So there you have it! I'm not guilty!
He's dead.
Looks like you did some serious shopping.  But where did you get the money?
Do you like your new teapot?
To be honest with you, the best tea tastes delicious whether it comes in a porcelain pot or a tin cup.  I know we've had some difficult times lately. We've had to struggle just to get by.  But it's nothing to be ashamed of. There is a simple honor in poverty.
There's no honor for me without the Avatar.
Zuko...  Even if you did capture the Avatar, I'm not so sure it would solve our problems. Not now.
Then there is no hope at all.
No, Zuko! You must never give in to despair. Allow yourself to slip down that road and you surrender to your lowest instincts.  In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself. That is the meaning of inner strength.
Mayor Tong, I'd like for the court to hear one last testimony.
This isn't just any witness. I'm going to call...  Avatar Kyoshi herself!
What are you doing?
Well, she is Aang's past life. Maybe wearing her stuff will trigger something.
I do believe in the power of stuff.
Please! If you could just wait one more second, I'm sure Kyoshi will be here.
Hey, everybody.  Avatar Kyoshi here.
So... what just happened?
Uhh... you kind of confessed. Sorry.
Uncle, I thought a lot about what you said.
You did? Good, good.
It's helped me realize something. We no longer have anything to gain by traveling together. I need to find my own way.
Wait!
The accused will now spin the wheel of punishment to determine his sentence.
I said I would face justice, so I will.
Community service! Please stop on community service.
Looks like it's "boiled in oil."
Gee, I'd love to help, but I'm supposed to be boiled in oil.
Boomerang! You do always come back!
What is this?
Happy Avatar Day, everyone.
This is by far the worst town we've ever been to.
Come on out  Avatar, you can't  hide in there forever!
Toph, metalbend the rudder so it's jammed in the turning position. The ship will spiral and slam into the others.
Got it. 
Have I ever mentioned how sweet it is that you invented metalbending?
You could stand to mention it more.
My leg!  Hang on Toph!
Aye aye, Captain.
Bye Space Sword.
How did that happen? Did Boomerang come back? 
No,  Suki did.
Come on out little boy,  you're about to be...
I'd really rather our family physician look after  little Zuzu if you don't  mind!
Zuzu,  you don't look so good! 
There you  are, filthy peasant!
I think I'm the one who should be thanking you.
Fire Lord Ozai, you and your forefathers have devastated the balance of this world, and now  you shall pay the ultimate price. 
No... I'm not going to end it like this.
Even with all the power in the World,  you are still weak.
What...what did you do to me? 
I took away your firebending. You can't use it to hurt or threaten anyone else ever again.
You did it! You should have seen yourself, it was amazing!  You were all like,  "pshoom, pfoom, pfoom, phish, whoom", and then the Fire Lord was all like,  "eugh, eh, eh, eh, eugh, aye".
So, did you...  you know...finish the job?
I'm still alive.
I learned there was another way to defeat him and restore balance. I took his bending away.
Wow, who taught you that? 
A giant Lion Turtle.
Well, look at you buster. Now that your firebending is gone, I guess we should call you the "Loser Lord". 
I am the Phoenix King!
Oh sorry, didn't mean to offend you "Phoenix King of  Getting His Butt Whupped."
Yeah, or how about "King of the Guys Who... Don't Win" 
Leave the nicknames to us  honey.
Mai!  You're ok.  They let you out of prison? 
My uncle  pulled some strings,  and it doesn't hurt when the new Fire Lord is your boyfriend. 
So does this mean you don't hate me anymore? 
I think it means...  I actually  kind of like you.  But don't ever  break up  with me again. 
Dad! 
I heard what you two did.  I am the proudest father in the world.  And your mother  would be proud too. 
There's my favorite warriors. I have to admit,  I kind of missed the face paint. How does it feel to be back in uniform again  
Careful Suki! Ty Lee is pretending to be a Kyoshi Warrior again.
It's ok.  She's one of us now. 
I can't believe a year ago my purpose in life was hunting you down, and now...
And now we're friends.
Yeah...we are friends. 
I can't believe a year ago  I was still frozen in a block of ice. The World's so different now.
And it's gonna be even more different, when we build it together.
Please, the real hero  is the Avatar. 
Today, this war is finally over. (Cut to Haru, Tyro,
I should count myself lucky.  The new Fire Lord has graced me with his presence in my lonely prison cell.
Why are you really here?
Because you are gong to tell me something.  Where is my mother?
Zuko, stop moving!  I'm trying to capture the moment.  I wanted  to do a painting, so we always remember the good times together. 
That's very thoughtful of you Sokka.  Wait!  Why did you give me Momo's ears?
Those are your hair loopies. 
At least you don't look like a boarcupine.  My hair's not that spiky!
I look like a man. 
And why did you paint me firebending? 
I thought it looked more exciting that way. 
Oh, you  think you can do a better job, Momo?
Hey,  my belly's not that big anymore,  I've really trimmed down.
Well, I think  you all look perfect!
Zuko, don't worry, we can take Azula.
I'm not worried about her, I'm worried about Aang. What if he doesn't have the guts to take out my Father? What if he loses?
Aang won't lose. He's gonna come back. He has to. 
What am I holding?
Correct. And what day is this?
Yes, it is. So please, tell me why on the most important day of my life you decided to leave a pit in my cherry? 
Small? Do you realize what could have happened if I hadn't sensed the pit in time? 
Yes. Then you will understand the severity of your crime. 
Oh very well. Since this is a special day, I will show mercy.  You are banished. Leave this palace immediately.  What are you all looking at? I have two feet that need scrubbing. And make sure you get in between the toes.  I won't have my first day as Fire Lord marred by poor foot hygiene.
It's weird to say, but the comet actually looks beautiful.
Too bad the Fire Lord is about to use it to destroy the World.
We're too late! The fleet's already taking off! 
Then we're taking off too. Where's the closest airship? 
It's right... 
Ugh.
Actually, everything's not alright. Do you know how long it took you to get here? 
Five, to be precise. In which time an assassin could have snuck in, done away with me and been on his merry way. 
Is this how you plan to treat your new Fire Lord? With tardiness and disloyalty? 
And I'm sure that's just what you told Long Feng before you turned against him and joined me. You're all banished! 
Goodbye. 
Please send in the next group on your way out.
Shh.
That's how it's done.
Good work, Toph. Time to take control of the ship. Take the wheel.
That's a great idea! Let the blind girl steer the giant airship.
I was talking to Suki.
That would make a lot more sense. 
What are we going to do about the rest of the crew? 
Take us down closer to the water. I've got an idea.
Attention crew, this is your Captain speaking. Everyone please report to the bomb bay immediately for hot cakes and... sweet cream. We have a very special birthday to celebrate.
Oh hi, I work down in the engine room. It's probably why we've never met before. Big airship, you know? 
Yep. 
Happy Birthday.
Fire Lord Ozai, here we come.
Azula, we heard what happened. Why have you banished all your servants?
All your Dai Li agents?
And the Imperial firebenders? 
None of them could be trusted. Sooner or later, they all would have betrayed me. Just like Mai and Ty Lee did.
My Father asked you to come here and talk to me, didn't he He thinks I can't handle the responsibility of being Fire Lord. But I will be the greatest leader in Fire Nation history.
I'm sure you will. But considering everything that has happened today...
Perhaps it's best you postponed your coronation.
What?! Which one of you just said that? 
What a shame. There's only one way to resolve this. You two must duel each other. I order you to fight an Agni Kai.
But...
Alright, fine.  Lo, you're banished. Li, you can stay. 
But I'm Li. So who's banished?
Ba Sing Se, the Order of the White Lotus is here.
Here to set you free.
Only once every hundred years can a firebender experience this kind of power.
Alright hair, it's time to face your doom. 
What a shame, you always had such beautiful hair.
What are you doing here?
I didn't want to miss my own daughter's coronation. 
Don't pretend to act proud. I know what you really think of me. You think I'm a monster. 
I think you're confused. All your life you used fear to control people. Like your friends Mai and Ty Lee. 
But what choice do I have?! Trust is for fools. Fear is the only reliable way. Even you fear me.
No. I love you, Azula. I do.
We're not going to catch up to him in time. 
No... 
Momo, time for you to go.
What just happened?
It's Aang! He's back!
After generations of Fire Lords failed to find you, now the Universe delivers you to me as an act of providence.
Please listen to me. We don't have to fight. You have the power to end it here and stop what you're doing.
You are right. I do have the power. I have all the power in the World!
Go, Aang! Airbending slice! 
Shouldn't we be helping him? 
The Fire Lord is Aang's fight. We need to stay focused on stopping that fleet from burning down the Earth Kingdom. 
And how do we do that, Captain Boomerang? I can't see outside of this floating hunk of metal. 
Airship slice!
Whoa. That's a lot of fire, isn't it?
It's going to be a rough ride. We need to get to the top of this thing, fast.
Then what?
Watch each other's backs and if we make it that far, I'll let you know.
Suki!
I'm okay! Just finish the mission!
No...
Sokka, I think we've gotta... 
What are you waiting for? Do it! 
Sorry, but you're not going to become Fire Lord today.  I am.
You're hilarious. 
And you're going down.
Wait. You want to be Fire Lord Fine. Let's settle this. Just you and me, brother. The showdown that was always meant to be. Agni Kai!
You're on.
What are you doing? She's playing you. She knows she can't take us both so she is trying to separate us. 
I know. But I can take her this time.
But even you admitted to your Uncle that you would need help facing Azula.
There's something off about her, I can't explain it but she's slipping. And this way, no one else has to get hurt.
I'm sorry it has to end this way, brother.
No, you're not. 
No lightning, today? What's the matter? Afraid I'll re-direct it? 
Oh, I'LL SHOW YOU LIGHTNING!
No!
Zuko!
You're weak! Just like the rest of your people. They did not deserve to exist in this world, in my world. Prepare to join them. Prepare to die!
Spare coins for weary travelers?
This is humiliating! We're royalty. These people should be giving us whatever we want.
They will - if you ask nicely.
Spare change for a hungry old man?
The coin is appreciated, but not as much as your smile.
We're not performers.
Not professional, anyway. 
It's a long, long way to Ba-Sing-Se,  but the girls in the city they look soo prett-ay!
And they kiss so sweet that you've really got to meet the girls from Ba-Sing-Se!
Such a kind man!
Hey, you takin' us down for a reason?
Aang!  Why are we going down?
What?  I didn't even notice.
Are you noticing now?
Is something wrong?
I know this is gonna sound weird, but... I think the swamp is... calling to me.
It is telling ya where we can get something to eat?
No, I... I think it wants us to land there.
No offense to the swamp, but I don't see any land there to land on.
I don't know... Bumi said to learn earthbending I would have to wait and listen, and now I'm actually hearing the earth. Do you want me to ignore it?
Yes!
I don't know... There's something ominous about that place.
See Even Appa and Momo don't like it here.
Okay, since everyone feels so strongly about this... bye swamp.
Yip! Yip!
You better throw in an extra "yip"! We gotta move!
Where's Appa and Momo?
Appa! Momo!
Sokka! You've got an elbow leech!
Where! Where!
Where do you think?
Why do things keep attaching to me!
You couldn't find them?
No... and the tornado... it just disappeared.
We better speed things up!
Maybe... we should be a little nicer to the swamp.
Aang, these are just plants! Do you want me to say "please" and "thank you" as I swing my machete back and forth?
Maybe you should listen to Aang.  Something about this place feels... alive.
I'm sure there are lots of things that are alive here, and if we don't wanna wind up getting eaten by them, we need to find Appa as fast as we can.
Appa! Momo!
There's no way they can hear us and no way we can see them. We'll have to make camp for the night.
What was that! 
Nothing. Just swamp gas.  Look, there's nothing supernatural going on here.
Ugh!
I think we should build a fire...
Sokka, the longer we're here the more I think you shouldn't be doing that.
No, I asked the swamp. It said this was fine.  Right, swamp?  "No problem, Sokka!"
Does anyone else get the feeling that we're being watched?
Please, we're all alone out here.
...except for them.
Right, except for them.
Guys?
What'd you reckon make a track like that, Tho?
Don't know, Due.  Something with six legs.  Pretty big'uns too.
Leaves a nice, wide trail to folla'.
You know what's at the end of that trail?
Dinner.
Aang?  Sokka?
Hello? Hello? Can you help me?  Mom?  Mom!
I can't believe...
Aang!  Stupid swamp! Dumb, ugly vines! Katara!  You think you're so tough, huh?
Hello?  Yue?  This is just a trick of the light... swamp gas...  I... hit my head running away last night. I'm going crazy.
Katara! Appa!
Hello?
Who are you?
Hey, come back!
Look at that, Tho. Is that little hairy fellow ridin' that thing?
Naw, that's what they call a "lemoo," saw one at a travelin' show once. Real smart they say.
Bet he tastes a lot like possum chicken.
You think everything tastes like possum chicken.
C'mon now, fellas. Just a little closer. Nice and easy. Nothing to worry about. We just fixin' to eat ya.
What'd ya say that fer?
Well, we are!
But you don't have to tell'em that!
Well how'd I know they'd understand me!
Come on!
Who are you?
What do you guys think you're doing! I've been looking all over for you!
Well, I've been wandering around looking for you!
I was chasing some girl.
What girl?
I don't know. I heard laughing and I saw some girl in a fancy dress.
Well, there must be a tea party here and we just didn't get our invitations!
I thought I saw Mom.
Look, we were all just scared and hungry and our minds were playing tricks on us. That's why we all saw things out here.
You saw something too?
I thought I saw Yue. But, that doesn't prove anything.  Look, I think about her all the time, and you saw Mom, someone you miss a lot.
What about me? I didn't know the girl I saw. And all our visions led us right here. 
Okay... so where's here?  The middle of the swamp?
Yeh, the center...
It's the heart of the swamp,  it's been calling us here,  I knew it.
It's just a tree. It can't call anyone! For the last time, there's nothing after us  and there's nothing magical happening here.
Now what would a lemoo need a shirt fer?
There's someone in there! He's bending the vines!
Why did you call me here if you just wanted to kill us?
Wait! I didn't call you here.
We were flying over and I heard something calling to me, telling me to land.
He's the Avatar. Stuff like that happens to us - a lot.
The Avatar! Come with me.
So, who are you then?
I protect the swamp from folks that want to hurt it.  Like this fellow with his big knife.
See? Completely reasonable. Not a monster , just a regular guy defending his home. Nothing mystical about it.
Oh, the swamp is a mystical place, all right. It's sacred.
I reached enlightenment right here under the banion grove tree.  I hear it callin' me, just like you did.
Sure ya did. It seems real chatty.
See, this whole swamp is actually just one tree spread out over miles...
Branches spread and sink and take root and then spread some more - one big living organism, just like the entire world.
I get how the tree is one big thing, but, the whole world?
Sure. You think you're any different from me? Or your friends? Or this tree?  If you listen hard enough you can hear every living thing breathing together, you can feel everything growing. We're all livin' together, even if most folks don't act like it. We all have the same roots, and we are all branches of the same tree.
But what did our visions mean?
In the swamp we see visions of people we've lost, people we loved...
...folks we think are gone. But the swamp tells us they're not.
We're still connected to'em. Time is an illusion, and so is death.
But what about my vision It was someone I had never met.
You're the Avatar. You tell me.
Time is an illusion... so, it's...  someone I will meet?
Sorry to interrupt the lesson, but we still need to Appa and Momo.
I think I know how to find them.  Everything is connected.
Come on! We've got to hurry!
Set my lines by the river bed!  Caught ten fish and I killed'em dead!  Cut'em and gut'em and I tossed the heads in the water to keep them cat gators dead. 
Appa!
We're under attack!
Hey, you guys are waterbenders!
You too? That means we're kin!
Hey, Hue! How you been?
You know, scared some folks, swung some vines, the usual.
Hue?
How you like that possum chicken?
Tastes just like arctic hen.  So why were you guys so interested in eating Appa?  You've got plenty of those big things wandering around.
You want me to eat old Slim? He's like a member of the family!
Nice Slim!
Oh, he don't eat no bugs! That's people food.
Where d'you say you're from?
The South Pole.
Didn't know there was waterbenders anywhere but here. They got a nice swamp there, do they?
No, it' all ice and snow.
Hmm. No wonder you left.
Well, I hope you realize now that nothing strange was going on here. Just a bunch of greasy people living in a swamp.
What about the visions?
I told you, we were hungry. I'm eating a giant bug! 
But what about when the tree showed me where Appa and Momo were?
That's Avatar stuff, that doesn't count.  The only thing I can't figure out is how you made that tornado that sucked us down.
I can't do anything like that. I just bender the water in the plants.
Well, no accounting for weather. Still, there's absolutely nothing mysterious about the swamp.
Hey, I remember her. She helped you attack us! 
Yup, back in the good old days. 
Oh great,  it's Prince Pouty. Where's your creepy grandpa?
He's my Uncle, and he's not here.
I see you worked things out with your girlfriend.
I'm not his girlfriend!
She's not my girlfriend!
Okay, okay,  sheesh. I was only teasing. So what you want?
I need your help finding the Avatar. 
Hmph. Doesn't sound too fun. 
Does the end of the World  sound like more fun? 
Nyla...  Who's my little snuffly wuffly.  Whoa!  Careful there. Okay,  whose got something with the Avatar's scent on it. 
I have Aang's staff. 
Well, what does that mean?
It means your friend's gone. 
We know he's gone, that's why we're trying to find him. 
No, I mean he's gone gone.  He doesn't exist. 
Where are we, Momo?  Maybe I'm in the Spirit World  But wait,  you can see me. We can both  be in the Spirit World.  Nope,  my bending works.  Maybe if we climb  to the top of the island we could figure out where we are.
What do you mean Aang doesn't exist?  Do you mean he's... you know, dead?
Nope, we could find him if he were dead. Ah,  it's a real head scratcher.  See ya. 
Helpful, real helpful.
Wait,  I have another idea.  There's only one other person in this World who can help us face the Fire Lord.  I'll be right back with a smell sample. 
You saved your Uncle's sweaty sandal? 
I think it's kind of sweet. 
Let's do this. 
Hey, wait up! 
We're going to Ba Sing Se?
Your Uncle's somewhere beyond the wall.  Nyla's getting twitchy so he can't be too far. Good luck. 
It's been a long day.  Let's camp and start our search again at dawn.
It's a hexagon.  It doesn't  seem raises his arms in exasperation and walks away like normal rock.  It's not made of earth. This is so strange.  I wish I had some help right now. I wish I had Roku. I do have Roku. 
So where am I, Roku? What is this place? 
I am.  I need to figure out what to do once I face the Fire Lord. 
Well, look who's  here. 
Everyone expects me to take the Fire Lord's life but I just don't know if I can do that. 
What's going on?  We're surrounded by old people. 
Not just any  old people. These  are great masters and friends of ours.  Pakku.
It is respectful to bow to an old master but how about a hug  for your new grandfather? 
That's so exciting.  You and Gran Gran must be so happy to have found each other again. 
I made her a  new betrothal necklace and everything. 
Welcome to the family Great Gramp. 
You can still just call me  Pakku. 
How about Grand Pakku? 
No. 
And this was  Aang's first firebending teacher. 
Master Piandao.
Hello, Sokka.
So wait, how do you all know each other? 
All old people know  each other don't you know that? 
We're all part of the same ancient secret society. A group that transcends the divisions of the 4 nations. 
The Order of the White Lotus. 
That's the one. 
It came from a Grand Lotus, your Uncle,  Iroh of the Fire Nation. 
Well that's who we're looking for. 
Then we'll take you to him.
Wait, someone's  missing from your group. Someone  very important. Where's  Momo? 
He's gone. And so is Aang. 
Oh well, so long as they have each other I'm sure  we have nothing  to worry about. Let's go.
Avatar Kyoshi, I need your wisdom. 
But you didn't really kill Chin,  technically he fell to his own doom because  he was too stubborn to get out of the way.
I knew I shouldn't have asked Kyoshi. 
So Bumi,  how did you end up escaping your imprisonment in Omashu? 
Escape? I didn't escape, everybody else escaped.  There I was,  back in Omashu, waiting for just the right  moment. I didn't know  what or when but I knew I'd know it when I knew it.  An eclipse. That would do it.
Taking back my city. You've got no  fire power and it's payback time.
Wow, you took back your whole city all by yourself. 
So what about you guys? Did you do anything interesting on the day of the eclipse? 
Nah.
No, not really. 
I need to look deep inside myself. 
Well, here we are.  Welcome to old people camp. 
Where... where is he?
Your Uncle's in  there,  Prince Zuko. 
Are you okay? 
No,  I'm not okay. My Uncle hates me, I know it.  He loved me and supported me in every way he could and I still turned against him. How can I even face him? 
Zuko, you're sorry for what you did, right? 
More sorry than I've been about anything in my entire life. 
Then he'll forgive you.  He will. 
Uncle. 
All these past Avatars,  they keep telling me I'm gonna have to do it. They don't get it.  You're right, maybe an air nomad Avatar would understand where I'm coming from.  I know you can't really talk. Pretending you can just helps me think.  I'm going to pretend I didn't pretend to hear that. 
Avatar Yangchen, the monks always  taught me that all life is sacred. Even the life of the tiniest spider-fly caught in its own web. 
I know, I'm  even a vegetarian. I've always tried to solve my problems by being quick or clever and I've only had to use violence for necessary defence and I've certainly  never used it to take a life.
But the monks taught me that I had to detach myself from the World so my spirit could be free. 
I guess I don't have a choice, Momo.  I have to kill the Fire Lord.
Uncle, I know you must have mixed feelings about seeing me.  But I want  you to know, I'm so  so sorry, Uncle.  I'm so sorry and ashamed of what I did.  I don't know  how I can ever make it up to you but  I'll...
How can you forgive me so easily? I thought you would be furious with me. 
I was never angry with you. I was sad  because I was afraid you lost your way. 
I did lose my way. 
But you found it again.  And you did it by yourself. And  I am so happy you found your way here. 
It wasn't that hard, Uncle.  You have a pretty strong scent. 
Wait,  is it just me or are those mountains getting bigger? 
They're not getting larger, they're getting closer.  The whole island is moving! 
It's amazing, Momo!  The biggest animal in the World!  I've got to swim around and find its face. 
Uncle, you're the only person other than the Avatar  who can possibly defeat the Father Lord.
You mean the Fire Lord. 
That's what I just said. 
Hmm...
We need you to come with us. 
No, Zuko. It won't turn out well. 
You can beat him and we'll  be there to help. 
Even if I did defeat Ozai, and I don't know that  I could. It will be the wrong way to end the war.  History would see it as just more senseless violence,  a brother killing a brother to grab power. The only way for this war to end peacefully is for the Avatar to defeat the Fire Lord. 
And then... then would you come and take your rightful place on the throne? 
No. Someone  new must take the throne. An idealist with a pure heart and  unquestionable honour. It has to be you,  Prince Zuko. 
Unquestionable honour? But I've made  so many mistakes. 
Yes, you have.  You struggled, you suffered but you have always followed your own path, you  restored your own honour. And only you  can restore the honour of the Fire Nation. 
I'll try, Uncle. 
Well,  what if Aang doesn't come back? 
Sozin's Comet is arriving and our destinies are upon us. Aang will face the Fire Lord.  When I was a boy, I had a vision that I would one day take Ba Sing Se.  Only now do I see that my destiny is to take it back from the Fire Nation so the Earth Kingdom can be free again.
That's why you gathered  the members of the White Lotus. 
Yes.  Zuko,  you must return to the Fire Nation so that when the Fire Lord falls, you can assume the throne and restore peace and order.  But Azula will be there, waiting  for you.
I can handle Azula. 
Not alone.  You'll need help.
You're right.  Katara,  how would you like to help me put Azula in her place? 
It would be my pleasure.
What  about us?  What's  our destiny today?
What do you think it is?
I think that... even though we don't know where Aang is, we need to do  everything we can to stop the airship fleet. 
And that means when Aang does face the Fire Lord, we'll be right there if he needs us. 
Nothing runs faster over land or swims quicker than a giant eel-hound.  The airship base is on a small island just off the EarthKingdom shore.  You should be able  to intercept the fleet within a day's journey. 
Thank you, Master. 
So if I'm going to be Fire Lord after the war is over, what are you going to do?
After I re-conquer Ba Sing Se,  I'm going to re-conquer  my tea shop and I'm going  to play Pai Sho  everyday. 
Goodbye, General Iroh.
Goodbye, everyone.  Today,  destiny is our friend.  I know it.
A lion turtle.  Maybe you can  help me. Everyone,  even my own past lives are expecting me to end someone's life. But I don't know if I can do it. 
It's time for this World to end in fire and for a new World  to be born from the ashes.
More ferocious! 
Imagine striking through your opponent's heart. 
Ugh! I'm trying.
Now let me hear you roar like a tiger-dillo! 
That sounded pathetic!  I said roar!
Who wants a nice, cool glass of watermelon juice? 
Ooo, ooo,  me, me, me! 
Hey,  your lesson's not over yet!  Get back here. 
Come on, Zuko.  Just take a break. What's the big deal?
Fine. 
If you want to lounge around  like a bunch of snail-sloths all day, then go ahead! 
Maybe Zuko's right.  Sitting around the house has made us pretty lazy. But I know  just the thing to change that. Beach party! 
Check out my Appa sand sculpture. 
Not bad, baldy. But I've been working on my sandbending  You're gonna love this.
Whoa.  Wow, you even made a little Earth King and Bosco.
Try and top that, Sokka.
Ta-da! 
Is that a blubbering, blob monster? 
No,  it's Suki. 
Suki, we'll all understand if you break up with him over this.
I think it's sweet. 
But it doesn't even look like... 
What are you doing?!
Teaching you a lesson! 
What happened?
Zuko's gone crazy! I made a sand sculpture of Suki  and he destroyed it! Oh, and he's attacking Aang. 
Get a grip before I blast you off this roof!
Go ahead and do it! 
Enough!
What's wrong with you?!  You could have hurt Aang.
What's wrong with me? What's wrong with all of you!  How can you sit around having beach parties when Sozin's Comet  is only 3 days away! 
Why are you all looking at me like I'm crazy? 
About Sozin's Comet...  I was actually going to wait to fight the Fire Lord until after it came.
After? 
I'm not ready.  I need more time to master firebending.
And frankly, your earthbending could still use some work too. 
So... You all knew Aang was going to wait? 
Honestly, if Aang tries to fight the Fire Lord right now, he's gonna lose. No offence.
The whole point of fighting the Fire Lord before the comet was to stop the Fire Nation from winning the war. But they pretty much won the war when they took Ba Sing Se. Things can't get any worse. 
You're wrong.  It's about to get worse than you can even imagine.
The day before the eclipse, my Father asked me to attend an important war meeting.  It was what I dreamed about  and wanted  for so many years. My Father  had finally accepted me back.  
The people of the Earth Kingdom are proud and strong. They can endure anything as long as they have hope. 
Well, that's not exactly what I...
I think you should take their precious hope  and the rest of their land,  and burn it all to the ground. 
I wanted to speak out against this horrifying plan.  But I'm ashamed to say I didn't.  My whole life I struggled to gain my Father's love and acceptance.  But once I had it, I realized I lost myself getting there.  I forgotten who I was. 
I can't believe this. 
I always knew that the Fire Lord was a bad guy but his plan is just pure evil. 
What am I going to do? 
I know you're scared.  And I know that you're not ready to save the World. But if you don't defeat the
Why  didn't you tell me  about your Dad's crazy plan sooner?
I didn't think I had to. I assumed that you were still going to fight him before the comet. No one told me you decided to wait! 
This is bad.  This is really,  really bad. 
Aang, you  don't have to do this alone. 
Yeah.  If we all fight the Fire Lord together, we got a shot at taking him down. 
Alright!  Team Avatar is back!  Air.  Water.  Earth.  Fire.  Fan  and sword! 
Fighting the Fire Lord is going to be the hardest thing we've ever done together. But I wouldn't want to do it any other way. 
Yeah.
Alright.
Get over here, Zuko. Being part of the group also means being part of group hugs. 
There's one technique you need  to know before facing my Father. How to redirect lightning.  If you let the energy in your own body flow,  the lightning will follow it.  You turn your opponent's energy against them. 
That's like waterbending.
Exactly. My Uncle  invented this technique himself by studying waterbenders. 
So... Have you ever redirected lightning before?
Once. Against my Father. 
What did it feel like? 
Exhilarating.  But terrifying.  You feel so powerful  holding that much energy in your body. But you know that you make the wrong move, it's over.
Heh.  Well, not over over, right I mean there's always Katara and a little spirit water  action... Am I right? 
Actually I used it all up after Azula shot you.
Oh.
You'll have to take the Fire Lord's life. Before he takes yours.
Yeah... I'll just do that. 
Gather round Team Avatar.  In order to take out the Fire Lord, or in this case, the "Melon Lord", our timing has to be perfect.  First, Suki and I will draw his fire.  Then, Katara and Zuko  charge in with some liquidy hot offence and while the "Melon Lord" is distracted, Aang swoops in and "BAM!"  He delivers the final blow. 
Err...  what about me? 
For now, you're the Melon Lord's forces.
So I get to chuck flaming rocks at all of you?
Whatever makes the training feel more realistic.
Sweetness. 
Muahahahahahaha! 
Watch it, Toph!
I am not Toph, I am "Melon Lord"! Muahahahahaha!
Now, Aang!
What are you waiting for? Take him out! 
I can't.
What's wrong with you?  If this was the real deal,  you'd be shot full of lightning  right now. 
I'm sorry, but it just didn't feel right. I didn't feel like myself.
There.  That's how it's done. 
I have a surprise for everyone!
I knew it! You did have a secret thing with Haru! 
Er, no.  I was looking for cooking pots in the attic and I found this.  Look at baby Zuko!  Isn't he cute?
Oh lighten up, I was just teasing. 
That's not me. It's my Father. 
But he looked so sweet and innocent. 
Well that sweet little kid grew up to be a monster. And the worst Father in the history of Fathers.
But he is still a human being. 
You're going to defend him?
No, I agree with you. Fire Lord Ozai  is a horrible person and the World will probably be better off without him. There's gotta be another way. 
Like what?
I don't know. Maybe  we can make some big pots of glue and then I can use gluebending to stick his arms and legs together so he can't bend anymore.
Yeah. Then you can show him his baby pictures and all those happy memories  will make him good again.
Do you really think that would work? 
No!
This goes against  everything I learned from the monks. I can't just go around wiping out people I don't like... 
Sure, you can. You're the Avatar. If it's in the name of keeping balance,  I'm pretty sure the Universe will forgive you.
This isn't a joke, Sokka! None of you understands the position I'm in! 
Aang, we do understand. It's just...
Just what, Katara?! What? 
We're trying to help. 
Then when you  figure out a way for me  to beat the Fire Lord without  taking his life, I love to hear it!  
Aang, don't walk away from this. 
Let him go. He needs time to sort it out by himself.
Hey, Momo.  I don't suppose you know what I should do.  I didn't think so. 
Okay, that's everything.
No, it's not.  Where's Aang? 
Aang? Aang! 
Come on lazy bones, let's go. 
He left his staff. That's so strange.
Aang's not in the house. Let's check the beach. 
Look! There's his footprints.  The trail ends here.
So... He went for a midnight swim and never came back?
Maybe he was captured.
I don't think so. There's no sign of a struggle.
I bet he ran away again.
Ah-uh. He left behind his glider and Appa. 
Then what do you think happened to him oh sleuthy one?
It's pretty obvious.  Aang mysteriously disappears before an important battle? He's definitely on a Spirit World journey. 
But if he was, wouldn't his body still be here? 
Oh yeah, forgot about that.
Then he's gotta be somewhere on Ember Island. Let's split up and look for him.
I'm going with Zuko!  What? Everyone else went on a life changing fieldtrip with Zuko. Now it's my turn. 
And then when I was nine, I ran away again. 
Uh-huh.
I know I shouldn't complain,  my parents gave me everything that I ever asked for. But they never gave me the one thing that I really wanted. Their love. You know what I mean? 
Look, I know you had a rough childhood but we should really focus on finding Aang. 
This is the worst fieldtrip ever. 
Judging by the looks on your faces, I'm guessing you guys didn't find Aang either. 
No. It's like he just... disappeared. 
Hey, wait a minute, has anyone noticed that Momo's missing too?
Oh no!  I knew it was only a matter of time. Appa ate Momo!  Momo,  I'm coming for ya, buddy 
Sokka, Appa didn't eat Momo. He's probably with Aang. 
That's just what Appa wants you to think. 
Get out of the bison's mouth, Sokka.  We have a real problem here. Aang is nowhere to be found and the comet is only 2 days away. 
What should we do Zuko?  
I don't know.  Why are you all looking at me? 
Well, you are kind of the expert on tracking Aang. 
Yeah, if anyone's got experience hunting the Avatar, it's you. (Cut back to Zuko's scarred side as he looks down. Cut to the ocean near dusk as Appa flies swiftly towards some dark clouds. 
Zuko, I don't want to tell you how to do your job but why are we heading towards the Earth Kingdom? There's no way Aang's there. 
Just trust me. 
Come on slowpokes, faster! 
Sorry I'm late, Father. Good palanquin bearers  are so hard to come by these days. So, is everything ready for our departure? 
What? 
But I thought we were going to do this together. 
You...  you can't treat me like this.  You can't treat me like Zuko! 
But it was my idea  to burn everything to the ground! I deserve to be by your side! 
Really?
Fire Lord Azula?  It does seem appropriate. But,  what about you? 
And the reason you brought us to a seedy Earth Kingdom tavern is what now?
June. 
Oh yeah  that weird bounty hunter with the giant mole. 
Mole? Her skin is flawless. 
No,  she has this giant mole creature she rides around on.
Her shirshu.  It's the only animal that can track Aang's scent anywhere in the World. It's the one shot we have of finding him.
I don't know who this June lady is but  I like her.
Hey Momo,  I just had the strangest dream.  Wait... 
Where are we? 
Doesn't it seem kinda weird that we're hiding  from the Fire Lord in his own house? 
I told you, my Father hasn't come here since our family was actually happy. And that was a long time ago. This is the last place anyone would think to look for us. 
You guys are not going to believe this. There's a play about us. 
We were just in town and we found this poster. 
What?  How is that possible?
Listen to this.  "The Boy in the Iceberg is a new production from acclaimed playwright Pu On Tim who scoured  the globe gathering information on the Avatar from the icy South Pole to the heart of Ba Sing Se.  His sources including singing nomads, pirates, prisoners of war and a surprisingly knowledgeable merchant of cabbage." 
"Brought to you by the critically acclaimed Ember Island Players." 
Ugh.  My Mother used to take us to see them. They butchered "Love Amongst The Dragons" every year. 
Sokka, do you really think it's a good idea for us to attend a play about ourselves? 
Come on, a day at the theatre?  This is the kind of wacky time wasting nonsense I've been missing. 
Hey, uh... I wanted to sit  there. 
Just sit next to me, what's the big deal? 
I was  just... I wanted to...  Okay.
Why are we sitting in the nose bleed section? My feet  can't see a thing from up here.
Don't worry, I'll tell your feet what's happening.
This is pathetic. My  jokes are way funnier than this. 
I think he's got you pegged.
Well,  that's just silly. I don't sound like that. 
Oh man, this writer's a genius. 
Wait, is that a woman playing me? 
I don't do that. That's not what I'm like! And... I'm not a woman!
Oh, they nailed you, Twinkle Toes. 
They make me
Actually, I think that actor's pretty spot on.
How could you say that?
You never  told me you made out with the Moon Spirit.
Shh. I'm trying to watch. 
So far, this intermission is the best part of the play. 
Apparently, the playwright thinks I'm an idiot  who tells bad jokes about meat all the time. 
Yeah, you tell bad jokes  about plenty of other topics.
I know! 
At least this Sokka actor kinda looks like you.  That woman playing the Avatar doesn't resemble me at all.
I don't know, you are more in touch with your feminine side than most guys. 
Relax, Aang.  They're not accurate portrayals. It's not like I'm  a preachy crybaby who can't resist giving overemotional speeches about hope all the time.  What? 
Yeah.  That's not you at all.
Listen, friends. It's obvious that the playwright did his research. I know it must hurt but what you're seeing up there on that stage is the truth. 
This is it! This must be where I  come in.
Here it comes. 
Wait a minute,  I sound like...  a guy. A really buff guy. 
Well Toph, what you hear up there is the truth. It hurts, doesn't it?
Are you kidding me?  I wouldn't have cast it any other way. At least it's not a flying bald lady.
Did Jet just... die?
You know, it was really unclear. 
Oh, you're getting up? Can you get me some fire flakes?  Oh and  fire gummies. 
You didn't really say that, did you?
I might as well have. 
It seems like every time  there's a big battle you guys barely make it out alive. I mean, you guys lose a lot. 
You're one to talk, Suki. Didn't Azula take you captive? That's right, she did. 
Are you trying to get on my bad side? 
I'm just saying. 
Does anyone know where Aang is?
He left to get me fire gummies like, 10 minutes ago.  And I'm still waiting.
I'm going to check outside. 
Are you alright?
No, I'm not.  I hate this play.
I know it's upsetting but it sounds like you're overreacting. 
Overreacting? If I hadn't blocked my chakra, I'd probably be in the Avatar State  right now. 
Suki, what are the chances you can get me backstage I got some jokes I want to give to the actor >me. 
I'm an elite warrior who's trained  for many years in the art of stealth.  I think I can get you backstage. 
Jeez. Everyone's getting so upset about their characters. Even you seem more down than usual and that's saying something.
You don't get it.  It's different for you. You get a muscley version of yourself taking down 10 bad guys at once and making sassy remarks. 
Yeah, that's pretty great.
But for me, it takes all the mistakes I've made in my life and shove them back in my face.  My Uncle. He's always been on my side even when things were bad. He was there for me. He taught me so much and how do I repay him?  With a knife in his back. It's my greatest regret  and I may never get to redeem myself. 
You have redeemed yourself to your Uncle.  You don't realize it but you already have.
How do you know?
Because I once had a long conversation with the guy and all he would talk about was you. 
Really?
Yeah, and it was kind of annoying.
Oh, sorry.
But it was also very sweet.  All your Uncle wanted was for you to find your own path and see the light. Now you're here with us.  He'd be proud.  
Ow.  What was that for?
That's how I show affection.
The scar  is not on the wrong side! 
He's coming this way.
Actually, I think I can help you.  I'm a big Sokka fan but I don't think you're representing him quite as well as you could be. 
Just hear me out. Here's something  I think the real Sokka would say.  "What does the cabbage merchant use to fix his cabbages?"  "A cabbage patch." 
Also, don't be afraid to make up some phrases.  Especially before an attack. Something like "Flying Kick-A-Pow!"
I'm just a guy who likes comedy. 
Katara,  did you really mean what you said in there? 
In where? What are you talking about? 
On stage. When you said  I was just like a brother  to you and you didn't have feelings for me. 
I didn't say that. An actor  said that. 
But it's true, isn't it?  We kissed at the invasion and I thought we were going to be together but we're not.
Aang,  I don't know. 
Why don't you know? 
Because we're in the middle of a war and  we have other things to worry about. This isn't the right time. 
Well, when is the right time?
Aang, I'm sorry but right now,  I'm just a little confused. 
I just said that I was confused.  I'm going inside. 
Argh!  I'm such an idiot!
Here's what you missed.  We went to the Fire Nation and you got better and Katara was the Painted Lady  and I got a sword and I think Combustion Man died.  Ooo look, The Invasion's  about to start. Shh.
I told him to say that. 
I guess that's it.  The play's caught up to the present now. 
Wait.  The play's not over. 
But it is over.  Unless...  This is the future.
That... wasn't a good play. 
I'll say.
No kidding. 
Horrible.
You said it. 
But the effects  were decent. 
Watch out! 
What are you doing?!
Keeping rocks from crushing you.
Okay, I'm not crushed. You can get off me now. 
I'll take that as a thank you. 
Come on, we can get out through here!
What are you doing?
Go ahead, I'll hold them off. I think this is a family visit. 
Zuko, no! 
Come on, we gotta get out of here. 
What are you doing here?
You mean it's not obvious yet  I'm about to celebrate becoming an only child! 
I can't get him to go in there. Appa hates tunnels.
Aang, there's no way we can fly out of here. 
We'll have to finda way. 
We need to split up.  Take the tunnel and get to the stolen airship.
No,  the Fire Nation can't separate our family again.
It'll be okay, it's not forever. 
I can clear that away and we can fly out through there. 
Umm, there's an awful lot of fire in that general direction. 
We'll get through, let's go.
She's not going to make it. 
Of course she did.
Wow, camping. It really seems like old times again, doesn't it 
If you really want to feel like old times, I could, uhh... chase you around a while and try to capture you. 
Haha.
To Zuko. Who knew after all those times he tried to snuff us out, today, he be our hero. 
I'm touched. I don't deserve this.
Yeah, no kidding. 
What's with her?
I wish I knew. 
What's with him?
This isn't fair.  Everyone else seems to trust me now. What is it with you? 
Oh, everyone trust you now?  I was the first person to trust you, remember Back in Ba Sing Se.  And you turned  around and betrayed me. Betrayed all of us. 
What can I do to make it up to you? 
You really want to know?  Hmm, maybe you could re-conquer  Ba Sing Se in the name of the Earth King. Or,  I know. You could bring my mother back. 
Opps, wrong tent.
Sorry. Do you need to talk to Sokka too? 
Nope.  Not me. 
Well, hellooo.  Uh, Zuko. Yes,  why would  I be expecting any one different?  So what's on your mind?
Your sister, she hates me and I don't know why! But I do care what she thinks of me.
Nah, she doesn't hate you. Katara doesn't hate anyone.  Except maybe some people in the Fire Nation.  No, I mean, uh, not people who are good but used to be bad.  I mean, bad people. Fire Nation people who are so bad, who have never been good  and probably won't be ever! 
Stop. Okay, listen. I know this may seem out of no where,  but I want you to tell me what happened to your Mother.
What? Why would you want to know that?
Katara mentioned it before when we were imprisoned together in Ba Sing Se and again just now when she was yelling at me. I think somehow... she's connected her anger about that to her anger at me.
It's not a day I like to remember. 
I'm going to find Mum. 
Many of the warriors  have seen the black snow before  and they knew what it meant.  A Fire Nation raid. 
We were badly outnumbered.  But somehow, we managed to drive them off.  As quickly as they came,  they just left.  I was so relieved when it was over but, that's because I didn't know yet what have
Wait. Can you remember any details about the soldiers who raided your village Like, what the lead ship looked like?
Yeah...  Sea Ravens. The main ship had flags with sea ravens on them. 
The symbol of The Southern Raiders. Thanks, Sokka.
No problem.  Thanks for stopping by.  Thought he never leave.  Suki.
You look terrible. 
I waited out here all night. 
What do you want?
I know who killed your Mother.  I'm going to help you find him. 
I need to borrow Appa. 
Why? Is it your turn to take a little fieldtrip with Zuko?
Yes, it is.
Oh. What's going on?
We're going to find the man who took my Mother from me. 
Sokka told me the story of what happened. I know who did it. And I know how to find him. 
Umm... and what exactly do you think this would accomplish? 
I knew you wouldn't understand. 
Wait, stop, I do understand. You're feeling unbelievable pain and rage. How do you think I felt about the sandbenders when they stole Appa? How do you think I felt about the Fire Nation when I found out what happened to my people?
She needs this,  Aang. This is about getting closure and justice. 
I don't think so. I think it's about getting revenge. 
Fine!  Maybe it is. Maybe that's what I need. Maybe that's what he deserves. 
Katara, you sound like Jet. 
It's not the same. Jet attacked the innocent. This man, he's a monster. 
Katara, she was my Mother too. But I think Aang might be right. 
Then you didn't love her the way I did.
Katara...
The monks used to say that revenge is like a two-headed ratviper. While you watch your enemy go down, you're being poisoned yourself. 
That's cute. But this isn't air temple pre-school. It's the real World. 
Now that I know he's out there, now that I know we could find him, I feel like I have no choice.
Katara, you do have a choice. Forgiveness. 
That's the same as doing nothing. 
No it's not. It's easy to do nothing.  But it's hard to forgive. 
It's not just hard, it's impossible. 
So you were just going to take Appa anyway?
Yes.
It's okay, because I forgive you.  That give you any ideas?
Don't try to stop us. 
I wasn't planning to. This is a journey you need to take. You need to face this man.  But when you do, please don't choose revenge.  Let your anger out and then let it go. Forgive him. 
Okay, we'll be sure to do that guru-goody-goody. 
Thanks for understanding Aang. Yip yip. 
You know, you're pretty wise for a kid. 
Thanks, Sokka.
Usually it's annoying but right now, I'm just impressed. 
I appreciate that. 
So... can I borrow Momo for a week?
Why do you need Momo? 
We need to find the Fire Navy communication tower.  All the navy's movements are coordinated by messenger hawk. And every tower has to be up to date on where everyone is deployed. 
So once  we find the communication tower, we bust in and take the information we need.
Not exactly.  We need to be stealthy  and make sure no one spots us. Otherwise,  they'll warn The Southern Raiders. Long before we reach them. 
Okay,Southern Raiders.  There.  On patrol near Whale Tail Island. 
Whale Tail Island, here we come. 
You should get some rest. We'll be there in a few hours. You'll need all your strength. 
Now, don't you worry about my strength. I have plenty.  I'm not the helpless little girl I was when they came. 
I'm going to find Mum.
Mum!
Mum, I'm scared.
I ran as fast as I could. 
Dad! Dad!  Please, I think Mum's in trouble! There's a man in our house. 
Kya! 
But, we were too late. When we got there, the man was gone.  And so was she. 
Your Mother was a brave woman.
I know.
There!  See those Sea Raven flags?  It's The Southern Raiders. 
Let's do this. 
So there I was and I was like, you know, you could... 
This is it, Katara. Are you ready to face him?
Who are you?
You don't remember her? You will soon. Trust me. 
What?  What's happening to me?
Think back. Think back to your last raid on the Southern Water Tribe. 
I don't know what you're talking about. Please, I don't know! 
Don't lie! You look her  in the eye and you tell me you don't remember what you did.
It's not him.  He's not the man. 
What?! What do you mean he's not? He's a leader of The Southern Raiders!  He has to be the guy! 
If you're not the man we're looking for, who is? 
You must be looking for Yon Rha. He retired 4 years ago.
That was him.  That was the monster.
We weren't behind the bush. 
Do you know who I am?
Oh you better remember me like your life depends on it!  Why don't you take a closer look. 
Just let her go and  I'll give you the information you want.
Mum, I'm scared.
Go find your Dad, sweetie. I'll handle this.
There are no waterbenders here.  The Fire Nation took them all away a long time ago. 
If I tell you, do you promise  to leave the rest of the village alone? (Cut to a side view of Yon Rha as he nods his head and makes a
She lied to you.  She was protecting the last waterbender.
ME!
I always wonder what kind of person could do such a thing. But now that I see you, I think I understand.  There's just nothing inside you. Nothing at all. You're pathetic and sad and empty. 
But as much as I hate you...  I just can't do it. 
Katara!  Are you okay?
I'm doing fine.
Zuko told me what you did.  Or... what you didn't do, I guess. I'm proud of you.
I wanted to do it. I wanted to take out all my anger at him but, I couldn't.  I don't know if it's because I'm too weak to do it or if it's because I'm strong enough not to. 
You did the right thing.  Forgiveness is the first step you have to take to begin healing. 
But I didn't forgive him. I'll never forgive him.  But I am  ready to forgive you. 
You were right about what Katara needed. Violence wasn't the answer. 
It never is.
Then I have a question for you.  What are you going to do when you face my Father?
I know you're nervous,  but remember... firebending in and of itself is not something to fear. 
Ok. Not something to fear. 
But if you don't respect it,  it'll chew you up and spit you out like an angry komodo rhino! 
Now show me what you've got. Any amount of fire you can make.
Maybe I need a little more instruction. Perhaps a demonstration? 
Good idea. You might want to take a couple steps back.
What was that?! That was the worst firebending I've ever seen! 
I thought it was,  nice. 
Why is this happening?!
Maybe it's the altitude.
Yeah, could be. 
Just breathe, and... 
That one kind of felt hot. 
Don't patronize me. You know what it's supposed to look like! 
Sorry Sifu Hotman.
And stop calling me that! 
Hey, jerks. Mind if I watch you two jerks do your jerk bending? 
Get out of here! 
Listen everybody;  I've got some pretty bad news. I've lost my stuff. 
Don't look at me. I didn't touch your stuff. 
I'm talking about my firebending. It's gone.
I'm sorry. I'm just laughing at the irony. You know... how it would have been nice for us if you lost your firebending a long time ago? 
Well it's not lost. It's just weaker for some reason.
Maybe you're just not as good as you think you are. 
Ouch. 
I bet it's because I changed sides. 
That's ridiculous. 
I don't know. Maybe it isn't. Maybe your firebending comes from
So, all we need to do is make Zuko angry... easy enough.
Ok, cut it out!  Look... even if you're right,  I don't want to rely on hate and anger anymore. There has to be another way.
You're gonna need to learn to draw your firebending  from a different source. I recommend
How's he supposed to do that? By jumping into a volcano? 
No. Zuko needs to go back to whatever the original source of firebending is.
So is it jumping into a volcano?
I don't know. For earthbending,  the original benders were badgermoles. 
One day, when I was little, I ran away and hid in a cave. 
That's where I met them.
They were blind, just like me,  so we understood each other. I was able to learn earthbending,  not just as a martial art, but as an
That's amazing, Toph. I learned from the monks, but the original airbenders were the Sky Bison.
Well, this doesn't help me. The original firebenders were the dragons, and they're extinct. 
What do you mean? Roku had a dragon, and there were plenty of
Well, they aren't around anymore, ok?
Ok, ok.  I'm sorry. 
But maybe there's another way.  The first people to learn from the dragons were the ancient Sun Warriors. 
Sun Warriors? Well, I know they weren't around when I was a kid. 
No, they died off thousands of years ago, but their civilization wasn't too far from where we are now. Maybe we can learn something by poking around their ruins.
It's like the monks used to tell me. Sometimes, the shadows of the past can be felt by the present.
So, what?  Maybe you'll pick up some super old Sun Warrior energy just by standing  where they stood 1000 years ago?
More or less. Either I find a new way to firebend, or the Avatar has to find a new teacher. 
We've been riding for hours. I don't know why, but I thought this thing would be a lot faster. 
Appa's right, Zuko. In our group, typically we start out our missions with a more upbeat attitude. 
I can't believe this. 
Don't worry. You'll get the hang of it.
Zuko, I think the past is trying to kill me.
I can't believe it. This booby trap must be centuries old, and it still works. 
There's probably a lot more. Maybe this means we shouldn't be here.
Where's that upbeat attitude you were talking about? Besides, people don't make traps unless they've got something worth protecting. 
Look. This seems promising.  Though I'm not sure what this tells us about the original source of firebending. 
They look pretty angry to me. 
I thought the dragons were friends with the Sun Warriors. 
Well, they had a funny way of showing it.
Zuko, something happened to the dragons in the last 100 years. Something you're not telling me. 
My great-grandfather Sozin happened.
He started the tradition of hunting dragons for glory. They were the ultimate firebenders. And if you could conquer one, your firebending talents
But I thought your Uncle was, I don't know, good? 
He had a complicated past. Family tradition, I guess. Let's just move on.
It's locked up.
Wait.  It's a celestial calendar. Just like the Fire Sages have in their temples. I bet that Sun Stone opens the door, but only when sunlight hits it at just the right angle, on the solstice. 
Monkey feathers! The solstice again? We can't wait here that long.
No we can't.  But we might be able to speed time up. Let's see if we can outsmart the Sun Stone. 
Nothing's happening.
Come on...
You know, Zuko, I don't care  what everyone else says about you,  you're pretty smart.
Relax. They're just statues.
It says this is something called The Dancing Dragon. 
Zuko, get over here. I
What?
Just do it. 
Let's follow the steps of the statues.
Don't you see?  These aren't dance moves. These statues are giving us a lesson.  I think this is some kind of Sun
This better teach us some really good firebending.
Hurray! Wait. What exactly is that? 
It's some kind of mystical gem stone. 
Well, don't touch it! 
Why not?
Remember what happened out there with those spikes  I'm just very suspicious of giant, glowing gems sitting on pedestals.
It feels almost alive.
Oh, no, it's another trap! 
Ugh, I can't pull free. It's like some kind of glue. 
I can't move. Zuko, do something!
Me? I can't move either.
It stopped. 
At least we have air. Maybe if we stay calm we can figure a way out of this.
You had to pick up the glowing egg, didn't you?
At least I made something happen. If it were up to you, we'd never
Help!
Who are you yelling to? Nobody's lived here for centuries. 
Well, what do you think we should do?
Think about our place in the Universe? 
We didn't come here to take your Sun Stone. We came here to find the ancient origin of all firebending.
Please, I don't normally play this card, but...  I'm the Avatar.
Just hear us out. 
My name is Zuko, Crown Prince of the Fire Nation. Or at least, I
Ran and Shao? There are two of them?
I don't believe it.
Um, Mister Sun Chief, sir? Yeah... I'm not a firebender yet. Couldn't my friend here carry my fire for me? 
I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.  It's like a little heartbeat.
Hurry up.
I can't. If I walk too fast, my
Your flame's gonna go out because it's too small. You're too timid. Give it more juice.
But what if I can't control it?
You can do it. I know you can. You're a talented kid.
But once they find out I'm the Avatar...
We could turn back now. We've already learned more about fire than we hoped. 
No, we're seeing this through to the end. We're gonna meet these masters and find out what's so great about them. 
What if they judge us and attack us? 
Well, we're the Fire Prince and the Avatar.  I think we can take these guys in a fight, whoever they are. 
Bring 'em out.
What's happening?
Zuko, my fire went out.
What do you want me to do? 
Give me some of yours. 
No, just make your own.
I can't. 
Get some from one of those warriors.  Hurry. Stop cheating off me! 
Quit being stingy!
These are the masters. 
You still think we can take 'em?
Shh. I never said that.
Zuko, I think we're supposed to do The Dragon Dance with them.
What? What about this situation that you think they want us to dance? 
Well, I think they want us to do something. Let's just try it.
Fine.
Their fire was beautiful. I saw so many colors, colors I've never imagined. 
Like firebending harmony.
I can't believe there are still living dragons. My Uncle Iroh said he faced the last dragon and killed it. 
So, your Uncle lied.
He must have lied to protect them, so no one else would hunt them.
All this time, I thought firebending was destruction. Since I hurt
Yeah. It's like the Sun,  but inside of you. Do you guys realize this?  
That's why my firebending was so weak before. Because for so many
Yeah, that's a great dance you two learned there.
It's not a dance. It's a firebending form.
We'll just tap-dance  our way to victory over the Fire Lord.
It's a sacred form that happens to be thousands of years old!
Oh yeah? What's your little form called?
The Dancing Dragon. 
Dad! You're on your feet again.
Thanks to your sister. I'm in no shape to fight but maybe there is someway I could help.
Everything's going smoothly and the eclipse hasn't even kicked in yet.
Let's hope our luck holds out. Katara, you seem distracted. Is something wrong?
Yeah... Is that... is that Aang?
What?
Please tell you're here because the Fire Lord turned out to be a big wimp and you didn't even need the eclipse to take him down?
He wasn't home. No one was. The entire palace city is abandoned.
They knew.
It's over. The Fire Lord is probably long gone. Far away on some remote island where he'll be safe during the eclipse.
No. My instincts tell me he wouldn't go too far. He would have a secret bunker. Somewhere he could go so it'll be safe during a siege but still be close enough to lead his nation.
If it's an underground secret bunker we're looking for, I'm just the girl to find it. 
The Mechanist gave me this timing device. It looks like we've got about 10 minutes until the full eclipse. 10 minutes to find the Fire Lord. 
We can still do this. We can still win the day.
Wait. If they knew we were coming, it could all be a trap. Maybe we should use the time we have left to make sure all of us get out of here safely. 
Everyone who's here today came prepared to risk everything for this mission. They know what's at stake. If there's still a chance and there's still hope, I think they would want Aang to go for it.
What do you think? You're the one who has to face the Fire Lord. Whatever you decide, I'm with you.
I've got to try.
Do you feel anything down there?
Yep. There are natural tunnels criss-crossing through the inside of the volcano. 
Anything else? Is there a structure somewhere?
There's something big, dense, and made of metal deep in the heart of the volcano. 
Sounds like a secret bunker to me.
Stay safe. We'll be back soon.
This way! That one's a dead end.
What would we do without you?
Perish and burn in hot magma.
Yeah, pretty much.
The tunnel continues on the other side and it leads right to the bunker.
We'll have to be fast but careful. 
How was that careful?
I was wrong. We need to be fast, careful and lucky.
There's no floor! It's just a river of lava. 
Climb aboard and hold on tight.
That's some door!
Not a problem. 
I am so glad we added you to the group.
The eclipse is only minutes away. We should be able to make it up the hill by the time it starts and secure the entire palace by the time it's finished!
We can wait here if you want.
No. I want to press forward with the others. 
Thanks.
Only 30 seconds until the total eclipse.
I'm ready. I'm ready to face the Fire Lord. 
So, you are alive after all. 
I had a hunch that you survived. It doesn't matter, I've known about the invasion for months.
I'm ready to face you. 
I'm here to tell the truth. 
First of all, in Ba Sing Se, it was Azula who took down the Avatar, not me. 
Because the Avatar is not dead. He survived. 
In fact, he probably is leading this invasion. He could be on us right now. 
That's another thing. I'm not taking orders from you anymore. 
Think again! I am going to speak my mind and you are going to listen. 
Where is he? Where is the Fire Lord? 
Hm, you mean I'm not good enough for you? You're hurting my feelings. 
Stop wasting our time and give us the information. You're powerless right now so you're in no position to refuse. 
And stick to the truth. I'll be able to tell if you're lying. 
Are you sure? I'm a pretty good liar.  I am a 400 foot tall purple platypus bear with pink horns and silver wings.
Okay you're good, I admit it.   But you really ought to consider telling the truth anyway.
When I left Ba Sing Se, I brought home some souvenirs.  Dai Li agents.
Surround the periphery! We have to secure the palace by the time the eclipse is over. Otherwise, we'll be in for the fight of our lives.
Stop! Surrender peacefully and we won't harm you.
There it is. The Fire Nation royal palace. We've come so far. 
It's not over yet. 
For so long, all I wanted was you to love me, to accept me. I thought it was my honor that I wanted but really, I was just trying to please you. You, my father, who banished me just for talking out of turn.  My father, who challenged me; a 13-year-old boy to an Agni Kai. How can you possibly justify a duel with a child? 
It was cruel! And it was wrong. 
No, I've learnt everything! And I had to learn it on my own. Growing up, we were taught that the Fire Nation was the greatest civilization in history and somehow, the war was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world. What an amazing lie that was. The people of the world are terrified by the Fire Nation! They don't see our greatness, they hate us! And we deserve it. We've created an era of fear in the world. And if we don't want the world to destroy itself, we need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness.
Yes. He has. 
I can't pin her down. She's too quick.
Wait! Aang, Toph, stop attacking.  Don't you see what she's doing? She's just playing with us. She's not even trying to win this fight! 
Not true, I'm giving it my all. 
You're trying to keep us here and waste all our time!
Um, right. I think your friend just said that genius. And since you can't see, I should tell you I'm rolling my eyes. 
I 'll roll your whole head!
She's just baiting you again. 
Okay, so what do we do? Just ignore her? 
We don't have a choice. We just have to get out of here and find the Fire Lord on our own somehow.
It's a trap. Don't say I didn't warn you.
Ignore!
So, Sokka's your name right My favorite prisoner used to mention you all the time.  She was convinced that you were going to come rescue her. Of course, you never came and she gave up on you. 
Come and get it...
Where is Suki?!
After I leave here today, I'm going to free Uncle Iroh from his prison and I'm going to beg for his forgiveness. He is the one who has been a real father to me. 
But I've come to an even more important decision. (pauses I'm going to join the Avatar. And I'm going to help him defeat you. 
Because I know my own destiny. Taking you down is the Avatar's destiny.  Goodbye. 
What happened that night? 
Where's Suki?! Answer me! 
Sokka, she won't talk. 
Where are you keeping her?!
So she's alive.
Oh. Sounds like the firebending's back on. 
Dad's all the way at the end of the hall and down the secret stairway on the left. I'm sure he'll be more than happy to see you now. 
I fell for it! I used up all our time. 
It's not your fault, Sokka. Azula was ready for us. She had every move planned out. 
And now it's too late. 
Maybe it's not too late. The eclipse is over but I can face the Fire Lord anyway.
No. I don't think that's a good idea. 
But I'm ready! I came here with a job to do and everyone's counting on me. 
The Fire Lord knew we were coming this time. We thought we had surprise on our side but we didn't. It just wasn't our day. What we need to do now is go help our friends. 
I guess you guys are right.
You'll have another chance. I know you will.
What should we do, Hakoda? Shouldn't something have happened by now? 
I don't know. But now that the eclipse is over I expect we're going to see some firebenders any minute.
They're back!
It was all a trap. Azula knew we were coming and she's plotted out every move. We just got to get to the beach as fast as we can. If we can make it to the submarines, maybe we can get away safely. 
They've got air power, but so do I!  I'm going to do what I can to slow them down. 
Appa, you and I can help too.
Everyone, let's get back to the subs! 
We can't keep them all back. They're too many of them! 
Let's join the others.
Uncle! 
Where is my Uncle? 
Try and find cover! I think we're about to see some bombs.
Why aren't they turning around to attack us again? 
They're headed for the beach. They're going to destroy the submarines!
How are we all going to escape?
We're not.
Then our only choice is to stand and fight. We have the Avatar, we could still win! 
Yes, with the Avatar we could still win on another day. You kids have to leave. You have to escape on Appa together.
What? We can't leave you behind. We won't leave anyone behind. 
You're our only chance in a long run. You and Sokka have to go with Aang somewhere safe. It's the only way to keep hope alive. 
The youngest of our group should go with you. The adults will stay behind and surrender. We'll be prisoners but we'll all survive this battle. 
I've got some experience with the Fire Nation prisons. It's not going to be easy but we'll get by. 
They're at the beach already!
Bye, Dad. I'm really proud of you. 
Take care, The Duke. 
I'll be back for you Dad. 
If we don't escape on our own first. 
We lost today but we've never been this close. We tasted victory and that counts for something. 
We'll miss you Dad.
Bye Dad. We won't be apart for too long this time. I promise.
Thank you all for being so brave and so strong. I'm going to make this up to you. 
Should we follow them, Princess? 
No. They're too fast. It doesn't matter, they'll be back. 
I know just the place for us to go where we'll be safe for a while. The Western Air Temple.
Line them up for the Warden!
Dad.  Excuse me, coming through. The Warden wants me over there  sorry. 
Welcome to The Boiling Rock. I'm sure  you've all heard the horrible rumors about our little island. Well I just want to tell you that they don't have to be true. As long as you  do everything I say. Look me  in the eye when I'm talking to you. 
No. 
Oh, you'd rather look at my shoes? Then take a look! 
I know exactly who you are, Hakoda of the Water Tribe. So strong willed. But don't worry,  we'll get rid of that in time. Now look me in the eye. 
See? Isn't that better. You will  all do as I say or pay the price.  You will all... 
Are you okay, Sir?
I'm fine! Get these prisoners out of my sight!
Thank goodness you're okay. 
If you take one step closer you'll  see just how okay I am. 
Dad, it's me. 
Sokka, my son. 
You know Sokka, you should be more careful with that guard outfit on. I almost punched you in the gut. 
Yeah,  I ran into that problem earlier. 
Are you comfortable Chit Sang?
Chit Sang, I only asked you if you were comfortable. 
Are you still comfortable?
I know you and your cronies are not smart enough to come up with that little escape plan. (Cut to Chit Sang's point of view as he looks at the
So where's Bato?  Where's everyone else from the invasion?
The others are being held at a prison near the Fire Nation palace. They singled me out as their leader and sent me here.  But before I left I met some young women who said they knew you. The Yoshinama Fighters?
You mean the Kyoshi Warriors?
That's right. 
Their leader Suki is here and she's gonna escape with us. 
Good,  we'll need all the help we can get. 
And you know Prince Zuko?
The son of the Firelord? I don't know him, but I knew of him. 
Well, he's here too. 
Sounds like a major problem. 
Actually, he's on our side now.  I know, I had the same reaction. After all he has done, it was hard to trust him. But he's really proven himself and I never would have found you without his help.  
So, do you have a plan? 
We had one  but some of the other prisoners got involved and ruined it.  I don't know if
Sokka,  there's no prison in the World that can hold two Water Tribe geniuses. 
Then we'd better find two. 
Zuko, are you there?
I'm here. 
I just got done talking to my Dad. We came up with an escape plan together. 
I was just  telling this dirty lowlife what I think of him!
Why? 
Could I just get ten more seconds to rough him up a bit? 
Take that! And this! 
We have a new plan but it's gonna need a big distraction. 
What are you doing? Where are you taking me?
I didn't do anything wrong. 
Come on  Zuko.  We all know  that's a lie. 
Mai. 
How is he? 
I think he's ready to talk. 
Have you had enough time to think about what I asked? 
And?
Who? 
How did you know I was here?
Because I know you so well. 
But... how?
The Warden's my Uncle you idiot.  The
I didn't mean to... 
You didn't mean to?  Dear Mai, I'm sorry that you have to find out this way, but I'm leaving. 
Stop!  This isn't about you. This is about the Fire Nation. 
Thanks Zuko. That makes me feel all better. 
Mai, I never wanted to hurt you.  But I have to do this to save my country. 
Save it? You're betraying your country. 
That's not how I see it. 
Sokka,  what's going on?
I don't have much time.  If I'm seen with you (Sokka looks out of the
That's great. 
Yeah and we're escaping today. On the gondola. 
What? 
My dad and I came up with a plan together. We're gonna commandeer the gondola and  we're gonna take a hostage with us so they won't cut the lines. 
We'll never make it onto the gondola. There's too many guards. 
My dad already thought of that. He said we'll need a distraction. That's why we're gonna start a prison riot. 
Okay. Let's say by some miracle this all works and we make it on the gondola. The Warden will still just cut the lines, even if we have a captive. 
Not if the Warden is the captive.  I have to go.  I'll find you before we start the riot. 
Why? 
Maybe I could schedule another time with him? How's tomorrow? 
Put him in the line up.
One of you is an imposter who thought 
Save your breath. I know you've been working together.  You threw Chit Sang in the very cooler they used to escape. It was all part of your plan. 
Sir, there's someone to see you. 
Who told you to interrupt me! 
I did. 
Princess Azula. Uh, it is an honor  to welcome you to the Fire Nation's most exemplary prison. I didn't realize  you were coming. 
Who is this?
He's a guard who was involved in a recent and feeble escape attempt. 
Quiet you. 
You're wasting your time.  That's not one of them. 
How do you know? 
Because I'm a people person. 
Hey, I just got orders. Let the prisoners out into the yard. 
But we're in the middle of lockdown. 
Oh, okay.  I'll just go tell the Warden you said that. I'm sure  he'll be glad to hear about you undermining his authority.  What's your name again?  
Wait. Don't tell the Warden, I... I'm just a little confused. 
Hey, I'm confused too.  But the Warden's in a bad mood and irrational. So if you ask me,  it's best not to question it and just do what he
Yeah, you're right.  We're letting them out. 
This is it. We have to start a riot. 
Okay, but how do we do that?
I'll show you. 
Hey, why did you do that for? That hurt my feelings. 
Aren't you mad at me?
Uhh, well normally I would be, but I've been working to control my anger. 
This isn't working. 
Actually, we're trying to escape right now. But we need a riot.  You wouldn't happen to know how to start one would you?
Impressive. 
Forget about controlling my anger. Let's riot! 
Who let these prisoners into the yard? This is supposed to be a lockdown! 
Ma'am, there's a riot going on. I'm here to protect you. 
I don't need any protection. 
Hah, believe me. She doesn't. 
I'm sorry but I'm under direct orders  from your Uncle to make sure nothing happens. 
Get off of me!
Zuko, good. We're all here. Now all we need to do  is grab the Warden and get to the gondolas. 
And how do we do that?
I'm not sure. 
Argh, I thought you thought this through. 
I thought you told me it's okay not to think
Maybe not everything. But this is kind of important. 
You wouldn't dare. 
Sorry Warden,  you're my prisoner now. 
We've got the Warden, now let's get out of here. 
That's some girl. 
Tell me about it. 
We're almost there. 
Back off, we've got the Warden. 
Let's go. 
Everyone in. 
What are you doing? 
I'm making it so they can't stop us. 
Way to think ahead. 
We're on our way. 
Wait. Who's that?
That's a problem.  It's my sister and her friend. 
This is a rematch I've been waiting for. 
Me too. 
Cut the line! 
Then it's time to leave.  Goodbye Zuko. 
They're cutting the line. The gondola's about to go!
I hope this thing floats. 
What are you doing?! 
Saving the jerk who dumped me. 
Who is that?
It's Mai. 
What is she doing?! 
Sorry Warden, your record is officially broken. 
Well, we made it out. Now what?
Zuko, what are you doing?
My sister was on that island. 
Yeah and she's probably right behind us. So let's not stop. 
What I mean is she must have come here somehow.  There.  That's our way out of here. 
Leave us alone. 
I never expected this from you. 
The thing I don't understand is why  Why would you do it? You know the consequences. 
I guess you just don't know people as well as you think you do. You miscalculated.  I love Zuko more than I fear you. 
No, you miscalculated! You should have feared me more!
You're both fools. 
What shall we do with them, princess? 
Put them somewhere  I'll never have to see their faces again.  And let them rot. 
What are you doing in this thing? What happened to the war balloon?
It kind of got destroyed. 
Sounds like a crazy fishing trip. 
Did you at least get some good meat?
I did.  The best meat of all.  The meat of friendship and fatherhood.
Dad.  
Hi, Katara.
How are you here? What is going on?  Where did you go?
We... kind of went to a Fire Nation prison. 
Seriously, you guys didn't find any meat? 
No one can make tea like Uncle.  But hopefully I learned a thing or two. Would you like to hear Uncle's favorite tea joke? 
Sure. 
I like jokes. 
Bring it. 
Okay.  Well, I can't remember how it starts but the punch line  is, "Leaf me alone, I'm bushed."  Well, it's funnier when Uncle tells it. 
Right. Maybe that's because he remembers  the whole thing. 
It's nice to get a chance to relax a little.  It hardly ever happens. 
Hey, can I talk to you for a second? 
So  what's up?
If someone was captured by the Fire Nation, where would they be taken? 
What do you mean? Who was captured? 
When the invasion plan failed, some of our troops were taken. I just want to know where  they might be. 
I can't tell you. 
What? Why not? 
Trust me. Knowing would just make you feel worse. 
It's my Dad. He was captured too. I need to know what I put him
It's not good Sokka. 
Please. 
My guess is...  They were taken to the Boiling Rock. 
What's that? 
The highest security prison in the Fire Nation.  It's on an island in the middle of a boiling lake.  It's inescapable. 
So where is this place? 
Why do you need to know? What are you planning?
Nothing. Boy, you're so paranoid. 
It's in the middle of a volcano between here and the Fire Nation. You guys actually flew right past it on your way here. 
Thanks Zuko.  Just knowing makes me feel better. 
Yeah, I'm sure it does. 
Not up to anything, huh?
Fine, you caught me. I'm gonna rescue my Dad.  You happy now? 
I'm never happy. 
Look, I have to do this. The invasion plan was my idea. It was my decision to stay when things were going wrong.  It's my mistake and it's my job to fix it.  I have to regain my honor. You can't stop me Zuko. 
You need to regain your honor? Believe me, I get it. I'm going with you. 
No. I have to do this alone. 
How are you going to get there? On Appa? Last time I checked,  prisons don't have bison day cares. 
We'll take my war balloon. 
What does it say? 
Need meat. Gone fishing.  Back in a few days.  Sokka and Zuko. One more thing.  Aang, practice your firebending while I'm gone. Do twenty sets of fire fists and ten hot squats every time you hear a badger frog croak.  Zuko. 
Nobody else has homework.  One hot squat. Two hot squat. Three hot squat. Four hot... 
Pretty clouds. 
Yeah, fluffy. 
What? 
What? Oh, I didn't say anything. You know, a friend of mine actually designed these war balloons. 
No kidding. 
Yep. A balloon. But for War. 
There's one thing my Dad's good at,  it's War. 
Yeah, it seems to run in the family. 
Hey, hold on. Not everyone in my family is like that. 
I know, I know, you've changed. 
I meant my Uncle. He was more of a Father  to me. And I really let him down. 
I think your Uncle would be proud of you. Leaving your home to come help us, that's hard. 
It wasn't that hard. 
Really? You didn't leave behind anyone you cared about?
Well I did have a girlfriend. Mai. 
That gloomy girl who sighs a lot? 
Yeah.  Everyone in the Fire Nation thinks I'm a traitor. I couldn't drag her into it. 
My first girlfriend turned into the Moon. 
That's rough buddy. 
There it is. 
There's plenty of steam to keep us covered. As long as we're quiet we should be able to navigate through it without being caught. 
We're going down. The balloon's not working anymore! 
The air outside is just as hot as the air inside so we can't fly. 
So what are we supposed to do?
I don't know. Crash landing?
How are we gonna get off the island if the balloon won't work? 
We'll figure something out. I suspected it might be a one-way ticket. 
You knew this would happen and you wanted to come anyway? 
My Dad might be here. I had to come and see. 
Uncle always said  I never thought things through, but this, ugh,  this is just crazy. 
Hey! I never wanted you to come along in the first place. And for the record,  I always think things through. But my plans haven't exactly worked, so this time I'm playing it by ear. So there. 
What are you doing? 
It doesn't work anyway.  And we don't want anyone to find it. 
I hope you know what you're doing.  There's no turning back now. 
I hope these disguises work. 
We just need to lay low and find my Dad as soon as possible. 
Guards! There's a scuffle in the yard, come on. 
We can't blow our cover. 
Uh, yeah, very cute sir. 
Super cute. 
Meet back here in an hour. 
Prisoners. Am I right? 
But what if there's an incident? If I'm not prepared someone could
Can the new guy ask you veterans a few questions about the prison?
No, that's not it. The Boiling Rock, it holds the Fire Nation's most dangerous criminals right? So what about war prisoners?
It sure looks cold in there. 
So Chit Sang, I hear you used firebending to try to escape. You should know better. 
No one  has ever, ever escaped from here. I'd sooner jump in the boiling lake myself than let that record fall.  Don't forget it. Now  go back to your shivering. 
Hey there, fellow guard. How goes it?
Zuko? 
Shh. Listen, I asked around the lounge. There are no  Water
What? Are you sure? Did you double check?
Yeah, I'm sure. 
No.  No! 
I'm really sorry Sokka. 
So we came all this way for nothing. I failed.  Again. 
Err,  what would Uncle say?  Sometimes clouds have two sides, a dark and light. And a silver lining in between. It's like a silver sandwich. So...  when life seems hard...  take a bite out of the silver sandwich. 
Maybe we haven't failed after all. 
That's the spirit. I can't believe  that worked. I didn't even know what I was saying. 
No, what you said made no sense at all. But look,  it's Suki! 
Prisoners!  Back in your cells!
What is it?  Did I do something wrong?
You mean you don't recognize me?
You people all look the same to me. 
Oh. Then maybe you'll recognize this. 
Sokka,  it's you. 
The other
No,  I don't know where they are. They locked me here because I'm the leader. 
Well, you  won't be here for long, I'm busting you out. 
I'm so glad  to see you Sokka. I knew you'd come. 
No, you can't go in there.  The lights are out... the prisoner  could sneak up on you. 
You're under arrest!  Don't worry, I'll figure it out. 
Well, well, well.  I never thought I'd find you in here, Prince Zuko. 
How did you know who I am? 
How could I not?  You broke my niece's heart. 
You're Mai's uncle?  I never meant to hurt her. 
Quiet! You're my special prisoner now. And you best behave. If these criminals found out who you are, the traitor prince who let his nation down. Why, they'd tear you to shreds. 
So what's in it for you? Why don't you just tell my Father and collect the reward. 
Oh in due time believe me, I intend to collect. 
Oh, good. You guys have met. 
A...actually, we met a long time ago. 
We did?
Yeah, you kind of burned down my village. 
Oh. Sorry about that. Nice to see you again. 
So listen, I think I have an escape plan.  I checked out the Coolers again, the whole point of them is to keep firebenders contained, right? 
Yeah... 
So they're completely insulated and sealed to keep the cold in. Well to keep the cold in it also has to keep the heat out, right?
Just get to the point Sokka. 
It's a perfect boat  for getting through the boiling water. 
The cooler as a boat? Are you sure? 
I'm telling you, it'll work. 
I walked around the perimeter. There's a blind spot  between two guard towers. It's the perfect launching point. I already tested it out.  We'll roll the cooler into the water and just float with the current.  It'll take us straight across. As long as we don't make a sound,  no one will notice. And bing, bang, boom we're home free. 
But how are you going to get the cooler out? 
What?  We didn't. We... We didn't say that.  
Yeah, you heard wrong. 
There's nothing to get in on. 
Yeah, the only thing we're hatching is... an egg? 
I guess we have no choice. 
Okay, you're in. Now, first we need someone  to unbolt the Cooler.  From the inside. 
Hey, you watch who you're shoving. 
I need backup over here. 
No firebending.  Into the cooler. 
I can take you back to your cell if you've learned your lesson. 
Yes, I have. Completely. 
I got Suki and Chit Sang out of their cells a few minutes ago. They'll be waiting for us at the shore. 
Someone's coming. 
War prisoners. It could be your Father. 
I know.  
Well, what should  we do? Are we going ahead with the plan or are we waiting another night?
I don't know.  Is it right for me to risk Suki's freedom? All of our
It's your call Sokka. 
Fine, everybody in the cooler. Let's go. 
Are you sure you want to go?  You're the one who said you wanted to redeem yourself. Redeem your honor. Rescuing your Dad is your chance. 
Your Dad? 
If I had just cut my losses at the invasion, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess. Maybe sometimes it's just better to call it quits before you fail. 
No, it's not. Look Sokka, you're going to fail a lot before things work out. 
That's supposed to make me feel better? 
Even though you'll probably fail over and over and over again. 
Seriously, not helping. 
You have to try every time. You can't quit because you're afraid you might fail. 
No, I'm staying.  You guys go.  You've been here long enough. 
I'm not leaving without you, Sokka. 
I'm staying too. 
We gave up our only chance of escaping.  I hope we haven't just made a huge mistake. 
Guards! Secure the perimeter  and lock down the prisoners. Now! 
The plan failed! They're caught. 
Get the fugitives and throw them in the Cooler!
Uh, they are in the cooler sir. 
One that's bolted down and not floating in the water! This is a lockdown!
The gondola's moving. 
This is it. 
If my Dad's not there, we risked everything for nothing. 
We had to. 
Come on, come on. 
Is that him? 
My Dad doesn't have a nose ring. 
Where is he?
That's it? That can't be it. 
I'm sorry Sokka. 
Oh no. 
Hey you,  get off  the gondola. 
Dad.
Hello? Avatar Yangchen? Anyone here?
It's an honor to meet you, Aang.
It's been such an amazing experience to meet my past lives.
And what did you learn by meeting them?
Well... I realized that no Avatar is perfect. They all struggled and made mistakes. Like me.
Very wise.
But it made me wonder - why is the Avatar Spirit a human in every life? Wouldn't it be better if the Avatar was an all-powerful spirit that never died?
I don't think so.
The Avatar must be compassionate towards all people...  ...and the only way to do that is to live with them.
The Avatar must experience sadness... . Anger...  Joy...  ...and happiness.
By feeling all these emotions, it helps you understand how precious human life is.... so you will do anything to protect it.  If you were an all-powerfull spirit living on the top of some mountain.... you wouldn't have much in common with an ordinary person.
So the Avatar continues to take human rebirth. And with each life, learns what it means to be human.
Now that I've reconnected with all of you, does that mean the Avatar Spirit is okay?
Yes. But your physical body is still injured. You need time to heal.
And unfortunately, it seems your ability to enter the Avatar State has been disrupted. You won't be able to rely on your past lives to help you. You must rely on your friends. And when you wake up, you won't remember this journey to the Spirit World. It will be like a forgotten dream.
Until we meet again, Aang.
This is humiliating.
Do you mean getting thoroughly spanked by the Fire Nation,  or having to walk all the way to the Western Air Temple?
Both.
Sorry guys, but Appa  gets tired carrying all these people.
I wonder how the rest of the troops are.
They're probably on their way to a prison. Seems like my dad just got out, now he's going back in.
I miss not having blisters  on my feet.
Hey, we're here. I can feel it.
No,  she's right,  we are here.
Wow,  it's amazing.
What a stunning view.
The only view I'm interested in seeing  is the Avatar in chains.
You know,  the Avatar hasn't been seen for a 100 years.  The chances of finding him here are very slim. 
First, we'll check each of the air temples.  Then we'll scour the world, searching even the most remote locations until we find him.
Prince Zuko, it's only been a week since your banishment.  You should take some time to heal and rest.
What else would I expect to hear from the laziest man in the Fire Nation?  The only way  to regain my honor is to find the Avatar. So I will.
It's so different from the Northern Air Temple.  I wonder if there are any secret rooms.
Let's go check it out.
You guys go...  I think we need to talk about some things.
I'll race you, Duke.
Why can't I go?
We need to decide what we're gonna do now. And since you're the Avatar, maybe you should be a part of this.
Fair enough. So, what's the new plan?
Well, if you ask me, the new plan is the old plan. You just need to master all four elements, and confront the Fire Lord before the comet comes.
Oh, yeah, that's great.  No problem,  I'll just do that. 
Aang, no one said it's gonna be easy.
Well, it's not even gonna be possible. Where am I supposed to get a firebending teacher?
We could look for Jeong Jeong.
Yeah right,  like we'll ever run into Jeong Jeong again.
Who's - Oh,  never mind. If it's important, I'll find out.
Oh well, guess we can't come up with anybody. Why don't we  just take a nice tour  around the temple?
What's up with him? 
There's got  to be someone who can teach him firebending.
Hello,  Zuko here. But I guess  you probably already know me... sort of. Uh...so, the thing is,  I have a lot of firebending experience, and I'm  considered to be pretty good at it.  Well, you've seen me... you know, when I was attacking you?  Uh, yeah...I guess  I should apologize for that. But anyway,  I'm good now.  I mean, I thought I was good before, but now I realize I was bad.  Ugh, but anyway... I think it's time I joined your group, and taught  the Avatar firebending.
Well, what's your answer?!
Yeah, that's what I'd say too.  How am I supposed to convince these people I'm on their side? What would Uncle do? 
Aang, can we talk about you learning firebending now?
What? The wind is too loud in my ears. Check out this loop.
Aang,  I think we should be making some plans about our future. 
Ok, we can do that while I show you the giant Pai Sho table.  Oh, you're gonna love the all-day echo chamber.
I think that'll have to wait.
Hello,  Zuko here.
Hey, I heard you guys flying around down there, so I just thought  I'd wait for you here.
I know you must be surprised to see me here. 
Not really, since you've followed us all over the world.
Right... Well, uh... anyway, what I wanted to tell you about is that I've changed, and I uh,  I'm good now. And, well, I think I should join your group. Oh, and I can teach firebending... to you.  See, I uh...
You want to what now?! 
You can't possibly think that any of us would trust you, can you? I mean, how stupid do you think we are?
Yeah, all you've ever done is try to hunt us down  and capture Aang.
I've done some good things.  I mean, I could've stolen your bison in Ba Sing Se, but I set him free.  That's something.
Appa  does seem to like him. 
He probably just covered himself in honey or something so that Appa would lick him. I'm not  buying it.
I can understand why you wouldn't trust me, and I know I've made some mistakes  in the past.
Like when you attacked our village?
Or when you stole my mother's necklace  and used it to track us down  and capture us?
Look, I admit I've done some awful things. I was wrong  to try to capture you, and I'm sorry that I attacked the Water Tribe.  And I never should've sent that Fire Nation assassin after you.  I'm gonna try to stop him.
Wait, you sent  Combustion Man after us?
Well, that's not his name, but...
Oh, sorry.  I didn't mean to insult your friend.
He's not my friend!
Why aren't you saying anything?  You once said you thought we could be  friends.  You know I  have good in me.
There's no way we can trust you after everything you've done.  We'll never let you join us. 
You need to get out of here, now.
I'm trying to explain  that I'm not that person anymore. 
Either you leave, or we attack.
If you won't accept me as a friend,  then maybe you'll take me  as a prisoner.
No, we won't!
Get out of here  and don't come back. And if we ever see you again...Well,  we'd better not see you again!
Argh, I can't believe how stupid  I am. I mean,  what was I thinking?  Telling them I sent an assassin after them? Why didn't I just say Azula  did that? They  would've believed that. Stupid!
Why would he try to fool us like that? 
Obviously, he wants to lead us into some kind of trap.
This is just like when we were in prison together in Ba Sing Se.  He starts talking about his mother,  and making it seem like he's an actual human being with feelings.
He wants you  to trust him and feel sorry for him, so you let your guard down, then he strikes. 
The thing is, it worked.  I did feel sorry for him. I felt like he was really confused and hurt.  But obviously when the time came,  he made his choice, and we paid the price.  We can't trust him.
I kind of  have a confession to make.  Remember when you two were sick and I got captured by  Zhao?
And you made us suck on frozen frogs? How could I forget?  I had a wart on the flap that hangs down from the back of my throat for a month!
Sokka,  I looked at it and told you there was nothing there.
I could feel it! It's my throatal flap. 
Anyway, when Zhao had me chained up, it was Zuko  who came in and got me out.  He risked his life to save me. 
No way,  I'm sure  he only did it  so he could capture you himself.
Yeah,  face it Aang. You're nothing but a big prize to him.
You're probably right.
And what was  all that crazy stuff about setting Appa free?  What a liar.
Oh, hooray.  In a lifetime of evil, at least  he didn't add animal cruelty to the list. 
I'm just saying that  considering his messed-up family, and how he was raised, he could've turned out a lot worse. 
You're right,  Toph, let's go find him  and give him a medal.  The "not as much of a jerk as you could have been" award.
All I know is that while he was talking to us, he was sincere. Maybe  you're all just letting your hurt feelings keep you from thinking clearly. 
Easy for you to say, you weren't there  when he had us attacked by pirates.
Or when he burned down Kyoshi Island.
Or when he tried to capture me  at the fire temple. 
Why would you  even try to defend him?
Because Katara,  you're all ignoring  one crucial fact. Aang needs  a firebending teacher. We can't think  of a single person in the world to do the job.  Now one shows up on a silver platter,  and you  won't even think  about it?
I'm not having Zuko as my teacher. 
You're darn right  you're not, buddy.
Well,  I guess that's settled.
I'm beginning to wonder who's really the blind one  around here.
Who's there?  Stay back.
It's me! style="mso-spacerun: yes">  Ow!
You burned my feet!
I'm sorry, it was a mistake! 
Get away  from me!
Let me  help you.  I'm sorry.
Get off me,  get off me!
I didn't know it was you.  Come back!  Why am I so bad at being good?
Has anyone seen Toph?
I haven't seen her since she stormed off yesterday.
Maybe she's just exploring the air temple. There are some pretty fun spots to practice earthbending.
I think we should go look for her.
Oh, let her have fun with her rocks. I'm in no rush to have her yelling at us again.
Yeah, I want to ride that tunnel down to the hall of statues again. It'll work a lot better now that I fixed my brakes.
Toph, what happened?
My feet got burned.
Oh, no, what happened?
I just told you, my feet got burned.
I meant how.
Well, I kind of went to see Zuko last night.
You what!?
Zuko?
Ugh!
I just thought he could be helpful to us. And if I talked to him, maybe we could work something out.
So he attacked you?
Well, he did and he didn't. It was sort of an accident.
But he did firebend at you?
Yes.
See, you trusted Zuko and you got burned... literally.
It's gonna take a while for your feet to get better. I wish I could've worked on them sooner.
Yeah, me too.
Zuko's clearly too dangerous to be left alone. We're gonna have to go after him.
I hate to go looking for a fight, but you're right. After what he did to Toph, I don't think we have a choice.
He's crafty, but we'll find a way to capture him.
Maybe just invite him back here. He's already offered himself up as a prisoner once.
Yeah... get him to come back and say he'll be our prisoner. Then we'll jump him and really make him our prisoner. He'll never suspect it.
You are a master of surprise, Sokka.
Ahh, that's the stuff. Now I know how the rest of you guys feel. Not being able to see with your feet stinks.
Stop!  I don't want you hunting the Avatar anymore.
The mission is off. I'm ordering you to stop!
If you keep attacking, I won't pay you!  All right, I'll pay you double to stop!
He's going to blast this whole place right off the cliff side.
I can't step out to waterbend at him without getting blown up. And I can't get a good enough angle on him from down here.
I know how to get an angle on him.
All right buddy, don't fail me now.
Yeah, boomerang!  Aw, boomerang...
I can't believe I'm saying this... but thanks Zuko.
Hey, and what about me? I did the boomerang thing. 
Listen, I know I didn't explain myself very well yesterday. I've been through a lot in the past few years, and it's been hard. But I'm realizing that I had to go through all those things to learn the truth. I thought I had lost my honor, and that somehow my father could return it to me. But I know now that no one can give you your honor. It's something you earn for yourself, by choosing to do what's right. All I want now is to play my part in ending this war. And I know my destiny is to help you restore balance to the world.
I'm sorry for what I did to you.  It was an accident. Fire can be dangerous and wild. So as a firebender, I need to be more careful and control my bending so I don't hurt people unintentionally.
I think you are supposed to be my firebending teacher. When I first tried to learn firebending, I burned Katara. And after that, I never wanted to firebend again. But now I know you understand how easy it is to hurt the people you love.  I'd like you to teach me.
Thank you. I'm so happy you've accepted me into your group.
Not so fast. I still have to ask my friends if it's ok with them. Toph, you're the one that Zuko burned. What do you think?
Go ahead and let him join. It'll give me plenty of time to get back at him for burning my feet.
Sokka?
Hey, all I want is to defeat The Fire Lord. If you think this is the way to do it, then I'm all for it.
Katara?
I'll go along with whatever you think is right.
I won't let you down, I promise.
So here you go, home sweet home. I guess, you know, for now.  Unpack... lunch soon. Uh...welcome aboard? Yeah.  Ok, this is really, really weird.
If I have to, I will spend every day of the rest of my life hunting the Avatar. I know it's my destiny to capture him.
You know, Prince Zuko, destiny is a funny thing. You never know how things are going to work out. But if you keep an open mind and an open heart, I promise you will find your own destiny someday.
You might have everyone else here buying your "transformation". But you and I both know you've struggled with doing the right thing in the past.  So let me tell you something right now. You make one step backward, one slip-up, give me one reason to think you might hurt Aang... and you won't have to worry about your destiny anymore. Because I'll make sure your destiny ends right then and there... permanently.
Wow, this is amazing to watch.      
Kind of makes you realize how insignificant we are.    
Eh, you've seen nothing once, you've seen it 1,000 times.   
Oh, man. You've never notseen anything like this. 
The fire is gonna destroy that town.     
Not if we can stop it. 
There's a creek over here. I'll bend the water on to the fire. 
Toph, let's make a trench to keep the fire from coming any closer.  
What should I do?   
Keep an eye on Momo 
So what, I'm just a lemur-sitter  There, there. Feel better?
Sokka, stand clear.
Right, stand clear. Got it.
Good work, everybody.
These people have no idea how close they were to getting toasted last night. 
Yeah, the worst thing about being in disguise is we don't get the hero worship anymore. I miss the love.
Boo-hoo, poor heroes.
What's your problem? You haven't even touched your smoked sea slug.     
It's just...all you guys can do this awesome bending stuff like putting out forest fires, and flying around, and making other stuff fly around. I can't fly around, ok  I can't do anything.   
That's not true. No one can read a map like you.
I can't read at all.   
Yeah, and who keeps us laughing with sarcastic comments all the time I mean, look at Katara's hair, right  What's up with that? 
What? What's wrong with my hair? 
Nothing, I was just trying to...
Look, I appreciate the effort, but the fact is each of you is so amazing and so special, and I'm not. I'm just the guy in the group who's regular.
I'm sorry you're feeling so down, but I hope you know none of us see you that way.  I know something that's gonna make you feel better.  
You do? 
Shopping! 
Maybe a little something to reinvigorate my battling.  Hey, how about these  Ho-ya! Smack-a-dacka-doo!
What do you think? (cut to a titling
What's a wind sword?  
It's where I get a sword handle. And then I just swing this around and bend air out like a blade. 
Yeah...nice.
I'll just stick to what I got.
Ooo.  That's what Sokka's talking about.     
That's it. That's what you needed all along, Sokka.    
A sword?     
Not the sword...a master.  We've all had masters to help us get better. You should see if you can study with Piandao.  
That's a great idea. I could've never gotten to where I am without Master Pakku. Everyone needs a teacher. 
I learned from badger moles. They don't talk, but they're still good teachers.
It would be nice to be a master swordfighter. All right, I'll talk to him.
Can I help you?
I've come to train with The Master.    
You should know The Master turns almost everyone away.  What did you bring him to prove your worth?
Well, uh... 
Right.  Let's get this over with.
Master, my name is Sokka, and I wish to be instructed in the way of the sword.  
Sokka. That's an unusual name. 
Oh, uh, really? Uh, where I come from, The Fire Nation colonies, it's a pretty normal name, for Fire Nation colonials.   
Let me guess. You've come hundreds of miles from your little village where you're the best swordsman in town. And you think you deserve to learn from The Master.  
Well, actually, I've been all over the world.     
Yep, here we go.  
And I know one thing for sure,  I have a lot to learn.   
You're not doing a very good job of selling yourself.
I know. Your butler told me that when I met you, I would have to prove my worth. But the truth is...I don't know if I am worthy. 
Hm, I see. Well, then,   let's find out together how worthy you are. 
I will train you.
The first thing you must learn is that your weapon is an extension of yourself.  You must think of it as another part of your own body. 
Like a second head.     
Well, more like an extra-long, really sharp arm. The sword is a simple tool, but in the hands of a master it becomes the most versatile of weapons,  and just as the imagination is limitless so too are the possibilities of the sword.
What should we do today? 
I'm tapped out. I already picked my toes, twice.
Twice?       
The first time was for cleaning, but the second time's just for the sweet picking sensation.
Sokka's been in charge of the schedule. I'm not sure what we should be doing.
Plus, it's so hot today.    
How hot is it? 
I don't know. Real hot?           
It's so hot, it's so hot... Momo is shedding like Appa. (pets
I guess the jokes don't run in the family.  
Oh, everyone's a critic.
The warrior practices a variety of arts tokeep his mind sharp and fluid.  The first
Writing my name will make me a better swordsman?
When you write your name, you stamp the paper with your identity. You must learn to use your sword to stamp your identity on a battlefield. Remember, you cannot take back a stroke of the brush, or a stroke of the sword.
You are getting ink on your face.     
I am?  I am. So this is about putting my identity on the page, right?
Landscape painting teaches a warrior to hold the lay of the land in his mind.   
In battle, you only have an instant to take everything in. 
Now, paint it. 
And no peeking.
I'm finished.   
You added a rainbow.   
Is that ok?      
Sokka. 
Concentrate on what you're doing.
Rock gardening teaches the warrior to manipulate his surroundings and use them to his advantage. 
Hm, manipulate them to my advantage. Oh!
Hey, would you mind grabbing a cold drink for me?
I'll take a slice of lemon in mine, please.        
So where are we going next?  We're starting from here.  
No, we're over on this island. 
You noodle-brains don't know what you're doing. I miss Sokka.     
Ooh, I got one. If you miss him so much, why don't you marry him?
You've had a good first day of training.   
I have? But I thought I messed up every single thing we worked on.
You messed things up in a very special way. You are ready for a real sword.
Are you giving me one of yours?
No. 
Your sword must be an extension of yourself. So tomorrow, you will make your own sword.
Choosing the correct material is the most important step in crafting a sword. You must trust your steel with your life. Choose carefully.  
Master, would it be possible for me to leave and bring back a special material for my sword?
I wouldn't have it any other way.
Sokka's coming!
Hey, guys. What are you doing?     
Sokka!     
You're back.     
We missed you so much. 
Say something funny.   
Funny how?
What's their deal?      
I don't know. They missed you or something. I didn't care. 
Thanks. That warms my heart. Anyway, I need some help. 
Who's this? 
Oh, these are my friends. Just other good Fire Nation folks.  Do you think we can make a sword out of a meteorite?
We'll make a sword unlike any other in the world.
Sokka, when you first arrived, you were so unsure. You even seemed down on yourself. But I saw something in you right away. I saw a heart as strong as a lion turtle, and twice as big. And as we trained, it wasn't your skills that impressed me.  No, it certainly wasn't your skills.  You showed something beyond that.  Creativity, versatility, intelligence... these are the traits that define a great swordsman. And these are the traits that define you.  You told me you didn't know if you were worthy, but I believe that you are more worthy than any man I have ever trained.
I'm sorry, Master. You're wrong. I am not worthy. I'm not who you think I am. I'm not from the Fire Nation. I'm from the Southern Water Tribe.  I lied so that I could learn swordsmanship from you. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, too.
No, this is my fight, alone.
Excellent! Using your superior agility against an older opponent...smart.
Good use of terrain...fighting from the high ground.
Yes, use your surroundings. Make them fight for you!  
Very resourceful. 
Excellent work, Sokka.
I think I'm a little old to be fighting the Avatar.   
How did you know?   
Oh, I've been around a while. You pick things up.  Of course, I knew from the beginning
But why would you agree to train someone from the Water Tribe?  
The way of the sword doesn't belong to any one nation. Knowledge of the arts belongs to us all.  Sokka, you must continue your training on your own. If you stay on this path, I know that one day you will become an even greater master than I am.
Wait.  The Master wanted you to have this, as something to remember him by.
It's a Pai Sho tile.      
The white lotus. Hm.         
What does it mean?   
I have no idea.  Ooh, that reminds me. Toph, I thought you might like this since you've probably never had a chance to bend space earth before.
Sweet. Check this out.    
You know, I don't think there's such a thing as "space earth." If it's from space, then it's not really earth.
Must you ruin everything?
I can't believe I missed you.
This is it, the official rendezvous point for the invasion force.
How did you pick this place?
Before we split up, my dad and I found this island on a map. It's
Nice choice Sokka. And we're here four days ahead of schedule.
Wait,  four days!  The invasion's in four days! 
Whatever.  That's like... four days from now.  Let's just calm down, and ... 
Sokka's got the right idea Aang. We're here, we're ready...  the best thing we can do now is get plenty of rest.
Uh..  I guess.
Your days of tyranny are over Fire Lord. I'm bringing you down!
Uah!  It was just a dream Momo, I still have my pants.  Well, I better keep training.
I'm just going to Mai's house, it's not far.
Hey, how long have you been up?
A couple hours.  I got a lot more skills to refine if I'm going to fight Ozai.
You know there is such a thing as over-training.
You don't get it, do you?  My form is bad. I'm sloppy. And I still don't know any firebending, not even the basics. 
That's okay Aang. The eclipse will block all firebending anyway, you don't need to know any.  Plus it's a stupid element.
Okay,  well, I still have to work on everything else. I'd better spend the whole day training. 
Good night Katara. Good night Sokka. Good night Toph. Good night Appa. Good night Momo. Good night Appa and Momo.
Go to sleep already!
Your days of tyranny are over Fire Lord. I'm bringing you down... and this time I brought pants. 
Math test?! Oh no!  I forgot all about the math test!  I've got to be ready!
Aang, it's the middle of the night. You need to go back to sleep.
But I forgot my pants and my math test.
Aang, sleep. Please...for me.
Tell me, if you can have anything you wanted right now, what would it be?
Hmm. A big fancy fruit tart, with rose petals on top.
You know, being a prince and all, I might just be able to make that happen.
That would be impressive.
Do you think  you can find a fresh fruit tart for the lady, with rose petals on top.
I guess there are some perks that come with being royalty.  Though, there is annoying stuff too, like that all-day war meeting coming up.
War meeting? What are you talking about? 
Azula mentioned something,  I assumed you were going too.
I guess I wasn't invited.
Sokka get up! I need to know what day it is! 
What?!  Who's talking?! 
Relax, it's still two days before the invasion.
Sokka, you've got to get up and drill your rock climbing exercises.
What? 
In one of my dreams, you were running from fire nation soldiers, trying to climb this cliff, but you  were too slow and they got you. 
But that was just a dream,  I'm a great climber. 
Then climb that cliff. Climb it fast! 
Stupid Avatar. Stupid cliff. Stupid dream! I can climb fast!
Don't drink that!
Why, is it poisoned? 
In my dream, we were right in the middle of the invasion, and you had to stop to use the bathroom. We died because of your tiny bladder. (Aang
Aang, I know you're just trying to help. But you really need to get a grip. You're unraveling.
You're right. I'm losing my mind. 
Ahhh!
It's like every time I think about how stressed I am,  I just end up more stressed.  I'm like a big, growing snowball of nerves.
Of course you are. That's 'cause you've got to fight the Fire Lord,  the baddest man on the planet. And you better win, or we're all done for. 
Sokka, you're not helping!
What? It's true. That's the deal, he knows it. 
You know what? I've got just the thing.  Get ready to be "de-stress-i-fied".  These yoga stretches can really work wonders if you do them in extreme heat. Reach up.  Reach for the sun.  Feel your chi paths clearing.  Now close your eyes. How are you feeling? 
I feel...really warm.
Good, good. Go on.
Like there's the warm feeling all around me. This heat... like I'm in the Fire Lord's palace, and he's shooting a bunch of fire balls at me. And the whole world is being engulfed in flames. 
Maybe your stress is the kind you need to talk out.
Why don't you get right down to business and tell me what's been bothering you.
You know what's bothering me. I have to fight the Fire Lord in a few days.
Mhm.  Tell me more about this, 'Fire Lord.' Why are you so afraid of him?
You said it yourself. He's the baddest man on the planet. I'm supposed to defeat him and save the world.
Hmm.  Life does feel that way some times, doesn't it?  Like we're all trying to save the world from evil.
Okay, but what can I do to feel better?
Want to try screaming into this pillow?
Hello Zu-zu. If you've come for a royal hair combing, I'm afraid you'll have to wait.
So I guess there's a big war meeting coming up, huh. And apparently I'm not welcome there.
What do you mean? Of course you're welcome there.
Oh yeah? I guess that's why no one bothered to tell me about it.
Oh Zuko, don't be so dramatic. I'm certain Dad wants you there. You probably weren't invited, because it's so obvious that you're supposed to be there.
Well, were you invited? 
Of course. I'm the Princess.
And I'm the Prince!
Exactly, so stop acting  like a paranoid child.  Just go to the meeting.
Forget it, I'm not going. 
Alright, what you need is a good old fashioned back poundin' to relieve your stress.
Pound away.  Ahh! Ow! Uh! Toph!  I ... think ... this ... is ... bruising ... me! 
Sorry, I forgot you have baby skin.  Well, there's one other thing we can try...  acupuncture!
Ahhhh!
Zuko, it's just a dumb meeting. Who cares?
I don't.
Well good. You shouldn't. Why would you even want to go?  Just think about how things went to the last war meeting you went to.
I know.
You know what will make you feel better? Ordering some servants around! I might be hungry for a whole tray of fruit tarts! And maybe a little palanquin ride around town... Double time!
Thanks for everything guys.
So do you feel less stressed? Ready for a good night sleep?
Uhh...I kinda think I sorta might ... slightly feel a little better ... maybe.
Then our work here is done. 
What happened Aang?
It's the nightmares. They just get worse and worse.
Looks like it's time for...  another therapy session.
No, that won't help. Nothing helps.  There's only one thing I can do. I'm going to stay awake straight through to the invasion. 
Invasion. All aboard for the invasion.
You don't look so good.  You sure you can't just lie down for a little nap?
I told you, I can't go back to sleep.
Aang, staying up can't be good for you.
Actually staying up all night has given me some time to think.  And I've realized some big things Katara.
What big things?
I see everything so clearly now... what really matters. Why I'm really doing this. I'm doing it to save the world,  but more than that. I'm doing it for the people I love.  I'm doing it for you Katara.
Aang, what are you saying?
I'm saying...I love you. 
What are we doing?
What our hearts  have been telling us to do for a long, long time. Baby,  you're my forever girl. 
Aang?
Huh?
I was just saying you should take a nap.
Oh,  I guess I kinda drifted off into a day-dream.
What was your dream about?
Uhh, living under water? 
Sounds neat.
Heh. Phew.
Prince Zuko,  everyone's waiting for you.
What? 
The high admirals, high generals, the war ministers, and the princess have all arrived.  You're the only person missing.
So, my dad wants me at the meeting?
Put 'em up, Fire Lord.
Hey, I'm trying to build Appa some armor here so he doesn't have to go into the invasion naked. He's your bison ...
Ozai's defense is impeccable. I'll have to try a different approach.  You think you're untouchable, don't you Mr. Fire Lord. 
Boy, you are really starting to lose it kid.
Momo, did you hear something.
No, but I said something.
Uhh. 
You my friend are just a few plumbs short of a fruit pie.
That's more like it.  I'm so tired, that for a second there I imagined you were talking to me.  Oh, Momo... let me explain.
Aang  We're all starting to get a little worried about you.
You've been awake too long.
And you're acting downright weird.
You've got to take care of yourself. You can't go on like this.
Uhh.  I appreciate what you guys are saying. But the stress and the nightmares, they were too much. Staying awake is the best way for me to deal with it.
Yeah, leave the kid alone.
Hey, who asked you?
Guys...come on.
No! I'm sick of this guy always mouthing off, (Cut to shot of Momo who is very mad  and telling me what to do.
Oh, you don't like i?  Well let's go right now.
Sokka, what should we do?
About what? 
About that! 
Come on guys,   we're all on the same side!
Huh? Huh!
I just need a jump in a cold waterfall. 
So, how did it go?
When I got to the meeting, everyone welcomed me.   My father had saved me a seat. He wanted me next to him.  I was literally at his right hand.
Zuko, that's wonderful.  You must be happy? 
During the meeting, I was the perfect prince.  The son my father wanted. But I wasn't me. 
Oh look, another hallucination. An imaginary bed, made out of clouds.
Hey! It's real! We spent hours working on it.
We made it for you.  A good night sleep will probably take the crazy away... we hope.
Look, you guys keep telling me I need to sleep, but I can't, the invasion's tomorrow.
Aang...
No Katara, there's still so much I haven't learned. I don't need sleep. What I need is practice. Quick, hit me. 
I'm not going to hit you.
You want me to do it?
Listen to me,  you've been training for this since the day we've met. I've seen your progress. You're smart, brave, and strong enough.
You really think so?
We all do. You can do this. You're ready.
You're the man,  Twinkle-toes.
Thanks guys.  You know what? I think I am ready. 
Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord.
No Fire Lord Ozai,  you're not wearing pants.
Momo!  Oh Momo!  Ah! Ha ha, you found me, buddy.  Hey guys, I think this river's polluted.
Well, that explains why I can't catch a fish around here. Because normally my fishing skills are... off the hook! Get it? Like a fishing hook? 
Too bad your skills aren't on the hook. 
It looks like we'll need to go somewhere else to get food.  Assuming that'll fit into Sokka's master schedule.
Hm...it's doable. But that means only two potty breaks today!
Hey, maybe we can get food there.
Now you look just like a little hill with horns. Bye buddy!
I don't feel anything. Where is this village? 
It's in the middle of the river!
Sure is!  My name's Dock. Mind if I ask who you are? 
We're, um, from the Earth Kingdom colonies.
Wow... colonials! Hop on; I'll give you a ride into town.
Why do you guys live on the river? 
Because we're a fishing town. At least that's how it was before the factory moved in.  Army makes their metal there. Moved in a few years ago and started gunking up our river. Now our little village is struggling to survive.
Thanks for the ride!
Look at this place. It's so sad. We have to do something to help.
No, we can't waste our time here! We have a bigger mission that we need to stay focused on. These people are on their own!
These people are starving, but you turn your back on them?! How can you be so cold and heartless? 
I'm not turning my back, I'm just being realistic! We can't go around helping every rinky-dink town we wander into. We'll be helping them all by taking out the Fire Lord!
Hey, loudmouth! Maybe we should be a little quieter when we talk about taking out the
Come on, Katara, be reasonable about this. You know our mission has to come first.
I guess so.
Let's just get what we need and go.
Hey, Dock. You work here too? 
I'm not Dock, I'm Xu. Dock's my brother.
But we just saw you. You're even wearing the same clothes. The only difference is your hat.
Dock works on the
I don't get it.
Me neither.  What can I getcha? Hey, I'll give you a special deal. If you buy three fish, I'll throw in a clam for free.
We'll just take the fish. Mind telling your brother we need a ride back to shore?
Hey, colonials. My brother says you need a lift.
Can you spare some food? 
I wish I could spare more.
Our detour into town today has completely thrown off our schedule. It's gonna take some serious finagling to get us back on track.
Finagle away, O schedule master.
Well, for starters, it looks like we'll need to wake up forty-three minutes earlier every day.
Forty-three minutes?
Look, we only have a few weeks to get to the Fire Lord in time for the invasion and the eclipse - which, by the way, only lasts for eight minutes. And we just lost a whole day. So if we want to make up the time and stay on schedule, we have to wake up early!
Well,I'm not waking up early. 
Or we could just cut out all of our eating breaks.
What? 
No way.
Forget it.
I got it, how's this From now on, we'll take food breaks and potty breaks at the same time.
Ew.
Hey, it might be gross, but it's efficient. Either way, we have to leave here first thing tomorrow morning.
What's the matter, Katara? 
I think Appa's sick.
What, Appa's sick? That's awful!
Wow, Sokka, I didn't realize you cared so much.
Of course I care. I might as well just throw our schedule away now.  And I'm concerned because my big, furry friend doesn't feel well.
He must have gotten sick from being in the polluted water.
He doesn't look sick. You okay, buddy?  His tongue is purple! That can't be good. Katara, can you heal him? 
It looks like he needs some medicine. Maybe we can find the right herbs in town.
Is it just me, or does this place seem different?
Yeah, are the people...happier? 
Hey, Xu, what's going on with everyone today? 
Ah, something amazing happened last night. Food was delivered to our village by a mysterious and wonderful person...the Painted Lady.
The Painted who now?
The Painted Lady.  She's part of our town's lore. They say she's a river spirit who watches over our town in times of need. I always thought she was just a legend. Until now.
See, we don't need to help these people, they already have someone to help them. All we need is medicine for our sick friend.
Medicine? Sorry, all the medicine we have goes to the factory. That's why there's so many sick people in our village.
Looks like we need to stay another night so Appa can rest.
I guess you're right. You got any more food to sell?
Would you like the
Two-headed!  What? You get more for your money that way.
Thank you, Painted Lady.
Hi, Dock. Is Xu around? 
Let me check... Hey there! Back again, are ya? 
We need more food. Our friend is still sick and we can't leave until he's better.
Oh, well, that's too bad. Maybe if you guys are lucky, the Painted Lady will visit you in the night, and heal your friend.
And maybe she'll cook us a midnight snack, and we'll all have a sing-along.
Yeah, may be! You know, last night she visited us again. Healed most of our sick folks.
Is that why this place seems so festive?
Yep, it's all because of the Painted Lady.
Can you believe how much an entire village can be affected by one lady? I mean... spirit?
Well, I hope she returns every night. Otherwise this place would go right back to the way it was.
Why would you say that? Look how much better off these people are.
Yeah, now, but without her they wouldn't be able to fend for themselves. If she really wanted to help, she would use her spirit magic to blow up that factory.  Oooooo... pow.
Spirit magic doesn't work that way, Sokka. It's more like... Woooooo....
What's the matter, buddy?  It's her!  Hello, Painted Lady spirit!  Excuse me, I don't mean to bother you, but my friend's sick and we're on kind of a tight schedule. Wait, but I'm the great bridge between your world and mine. I know Hei Bai, we're close personal friends.  Heeeyy!!
My name's Aang. I'm the Avatar.
Well, hello, Avatar. I wish I could talk, but I am very busy.
Yeah, me too. I hate that.  You know, you're really pretty for a spirit. I don't get to meet too many spirits, but the ones I do meet...not very attractive.
Thank you, but...
You seem familiar, too.
A lot of people say that.
No...you really seem familiar.
Look, I really should get going...
Katara !
Hi, Aang.
You're the Painted Lady ! But how?
I wasn't at first, I was just trying to help the village. But since everyone thought that's who I was anyway...I guess I just kind of became her.
So you've been sneaking out at night? Wait...is Appa even sick 
He...might be sick of the purple berries I've been feeding him, but, other than that, he's fine.
I can't believe you lied to everyone so you could help these people.
I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't have.
No, I think it's great! You're like a secret hero.
Well, if you want to help...there's one more thing I have to do.
You want to destroy this factory? 
Yes. Sokka was just kidding, but he was right. Getting rid of this factory is the only way to help these people permanently.
Ha ha! 
Shhh, we don't want to wake Sokka.  Hi! Sokka! We were just...out on a...morning walk!
Oh, really? A morning walk?  I know you're the Painted Lady. I know you've been sneaking out at night, and I know you've been lying about Appa and feeding him purplizing tongue berries!  Katara, what you did put our whole mission in jeopardy. We're leaving right now.  And how long did you know about this?
Hey, I just found out this morning.
What's going on? 
Fire Nation soldiers are heading to the village.
What did you do?!
I...kind of destroyed their factory.
You what?!
It was your idea!
I was joking. I also said to use spirit magic and made funny noises. Did you even think this through? The army's gonna blame the villagers. They're headed there right now to get revenge.
Well, what was I supposed to do?
Leave! Do nothing!
No. I will never, ever turn my back on people who need me.  I'm going down to the village, and I am gonna do whatever I can.
Wait. I'm coming too.
I thought you didn't want to help.
You need me, and I will never turn my back on you.
Sokka. You really do have a heart. 
He really does have a heart, doesn't he?
We didn't do any of that.  Yeah, the Painted Lady brought us food. She's the one that healed our sick, not your medicine.
It's the Painted Lady. She's coming.
Leave this village and never come back.
I knew you'd come.
Thank you!
Me and my brothers really owe you a lot.  Hey, wait a minute! I know you! You're not the Painted Lady, you're that colonial girl!
Yeah, you're the lady that gave me a fish.
You've been tricking us. You're a waterbender!
Maybe she is a waterbender, but she was just trying to help you. Because of her, that factory won't be polluting your river, and the army is gone. You should be down on your knees thanking her.
Sokka, it's okay.  I shouldn't have acted like someone I wasn't, and I shouldn't have tricked you. But I felt like I had to do something. It doesn't matter if the Painted Lady is real or not. Because your problems are real, and this river is real. You can't wait around for someone to help you. You have to help yourself.
She's right, but what should we do? 
Maybe we can clean the river.
Yeah, we can clean the river!  Thank you. You know, you're not so bad for a waterbender.
You wouldn't mind keeping that a secret, by the way, would you?
No problem. Keeping my mouth shut is a personal specialty. My brother Xu, on the other hand, hoo! He's a blabbermouth.
So, Dock, are you gonna help us clean?
No, ma'am. I'm going to get my other brother, Bushi. He loves cleaning rivers.  Alright, I'm Bushi! Let's get some river cleaning done.
Aha, I knew it! I knew you were the same guy. You're the shop owner and the boat guy.
Oh, you must be talking about my brothers, Dock and Xu.
No, I just saw you! You switched hats and called yourself a different name!
Oh, you know who does that? My brother Dock.  He's crazy.
How could you do this to me? You betrayed me!
You brought this on yourself. I had no choice.
Ok, I'm ready for some training!
Good job, twinkle-toes. Visualize - then attack!
Maybe you should take your own advice, Toph.
What's the matter? Can't handle some dirt, Madame Fussy Britches?
Oh, sorry, did I splash you, mud slug?
Are we taking a break?
Yaaaaaah, sneak attack!
Sokka, sneak attacks don't work if you yell it out loud.
Hungry for a mud pie?
I'll give you a mud pie. 
Uh, guys, I thought we were supposed to be training me.
Very well, pupil. I believe we've had enough training for today.
While Katara cleans up, let's go have some fun!
Look at all those messenger hawks. You know, I've been thinking about getting one for myself. That way, I wouldn't have to talk to anyone... I could just send them messages!
I gotta say, I like the idea of not talking to you.
So, guys, what are we gonna get with our last silver piece?
We can get more money. Right there.  This is where you seeing people are at a disadvantage. Everyone guesses wrong because the dealer moves the rock at the last minute. But I can feel it with my earthbending.
You there. Want to play a friendly game?
How could I possibly play? I'm blind.
You don't have to see to be lucky.
Flamey-o, Toph!
Wow, fancy guessing. You are amazing at this. Would you like to make the game a little more interesting?
More interesting? How? 
Well, let's say you toss in your friend's fine sword there. Then I'll put up twenty silver pieces against it, and that's more interesting.
I'll do it for forty silver pieces.
Forty silver pieces it is.  Sorry, little lady, but...  ...huh? 
I won!
Where did you guys get the money to buy all this stuff? 
Toph got us money. She scammed one of those guys in town who moves the shells around all sneaky-like.
She used earthbending to win the game. Classic!
Ah, so she cheated.
Hey, I only cheated because he was cheating. I cheated a cheater. What's wrong with that?
I'm just saying, this isn't something we should make a habit of doing.
Why? Because its fun, and you hate fun?
I don't hate fun.  See? Fun. 
Katara, I'll personally make you an Avatar promise that we won't make a habit of doing these scams.
Guys, I think these scams have gone far enough. If you keep doing them, something bad is gonna happen.
Could you for once stop being such a sourpuss and just lighten up? 
Oh, I'm sorry. You think I should be more like you? Like some wild child?
Yeah, maybe. Maybe then, you'd see how great we have it. I mean, look at us. We're traveling around the world, making easy money, having fun, with no parents to tell us what to do.
Ah, I see. You're acting like this because of your parents.
Whatever.
They were controlling over you, so you ran away, and now you act like your parents don't exist. You act like you hate them, but you don't. You just feel guilty.
I do hate them!
I don't think so. I think you miss them. But you just don't want to deal with that, so instead, you act like this crazy person.
Look. I ran away to help Aang!
You know what? It doesn't matter. These scams put us all at risk, and we don't need that. We've already got some third-eyed freak after us.
Speaking of that third-eyed freak... I think I've come up with a name for him. What do you think of..."Sparky-Sparky Boom Man"!  Just think about it.
We have enough money. You need to stop this!
I'll stop when I want to stop, and not when you tell me!
Speaking of money, I'm off to spend some. See you guys later  Hawky, welcome to Team Avatar. My name's Sokka, and I'm your new owner. And as such, I should warn you that there's already a lemur in our group, so I don't want to see any fighting.  Good wittle messenger Hawky. Who's got pwetty feathers?  You're right, Hawky. This is bad.
Toph, when I was in town, I found something that you're not gonna like.
Well, it sounds like a sheet of paper, but I guess you're referring to what's on the sheet of paper.
It's a wanted poster. Of you. They've nicknamed you "The Runaway."
A wanted poster. That's so great. "The Runaway". I love my new nickname. Is there a picture of me? Does it look good?
Well, yeah, actually, it does look pretty good. But Toph, you're missing the point. Maybe Katara was right. These scams are drawing too much attention to us.
Don't be such a worrywart like your sister. Think of it this way. Now you have plenty of money to help with the invasion plan!
Well, that is true. I had this idea of making armor for Appa.
Here's a little extra so you can get yourself a nice map of the Fire Nation. You know what? Make it an atlas.
I do like expensive atlases.
Of course you do. And that's why this wanted poster is going to stay our little secret.
Sokka, tell me you didn't buy a bird.
Not just a bird. A messenger bird! Now we can send messages all over the world, even to Gran-Gran.
Wow, how does it work?
Hm, uh, I never actually thought about that. Hawky: Gran-Gran, South Pole.  I think he gets it.  Hawky, make nice! Bad Hawky!
Well, look who decided to join us. Where have you two been? Off scamming again?
Yes, we were.
And I suppose you don't think what you're doing is dangerous at all?
No, I don't.
Really?
Yes, really.
Well then, what's this?
I don't know! I mean, seriously, what's with you people I'm blind!
It's a wanted poster of you. "The Runaway". Is that what you're called now? Are you proud of this?
Where did you get that?!
It doesn't matter where I got it. The fact is...
You went through my stuff! You had no right.
Your stuff was messy, and I was just straightening up and I happened to stumble across it.
That's a lie! You're lying, Katara.
Fine! It's a lie. But you've been so out of control lately, I knew something was up. I knew you were hiding something, and you were.  Don't you walk away from me while I'm talking to you!
Oh, really, Mom? Or what are you going to do? Send me to my room?
I wish I could.
Well, you can't. Because you're not my mom, and you're not their mom.
I never said I was!
No, but you certainly act like it. You think it's your job to boss everyone around, but it's not. You're just a regular kid like the rest of us, so stop acting like you can tell me what to do. I can do whatever I want!
I don't act that way.  Sokka, do I act motherly?
Hey - I'm staying out of this one.
What do you think, Aang? Do I act like a mom?
Well, I...
Stop rubbing your eye and speak clearly when you talk!
Yes, ma'am.
I can't be around you right now!
Well, I can't be around you!
I know, Hawky. Why can't they just get along?
Hey, Aang, you want to test out my messenger hawk with me? I've got an idea.
Sure.
I'm gonna send a note to Katara and say it's from Toph, who wants to apologize. Then everyone will be friends again.
I gotta say, Sokka, you continue to impress me with your ideas.
Eh, it's a gift.  Dear Katara. Sorry for everything. Your friend, Toph.
I know this is from you, Sokka. Toph can't write. Ugh, you're all driving me crazy!
I can't believe we forgot Toph can't write.
Yep, we're idiots. 
I guess plan B is, we send a note to Toph pretending it's from Katara.
I think we're gonna run into a similar problem. Sorry, Hawky. Looks like I'm gonna have to do this without your help.  Come on, we need to talk.
So let me guess. You brought me out here to tell me your sister's not as annoying as I make her out to be.
Nah, she's pretty much a pain.  She's always got to be right about everything, and she gets all bossy, and involved, and in your business.
Yeah, I don't know how you can deal with it.
Actually, in a way, I rely on it.
I don't understand.
When our mom died, that was the hardest time in my life. Our family was a mess, but Katara, she had so much strength. She stepped up and took on so much responsibility. She helped fill the void that was left by our mom.
I guess I never thought about that.
I'm gonna tell you something crazy. I never told anyone this before, but honestly, I'm not sure I can remember what my mother looked like. It really seems like, my whole life, Katara's been the one looking out for me. She's always been the one that's there, and now, when I try to remember my mom, Katara's is the only face I can picture.
The truth is, sometimes Katara does act motherly, but that's not always a bad thing. She's compassionate and kind, and she actually cares about me. You know, the real me. That's more than my own mom.   Don't ever tell her I said any of this.
Hey, my lips are sealed.
Hi, Toph. Um, I want to...
Katara, stop. You don't need to apologize. I was the one being stupid. These scams are out of control, and I'm done with them.
Actually, I wasn't going to apologize. I was gonna say... I want to pull a scam with you!
What? You want to pull a scam?
Not just any scam...the ultimate scam!  What do you say, Toph? Just me and you... one last go. You in?
You know I'm in! Now what's this idea of yours?
The plan is simple. This wanted poster says you're worth a lot of money.  Ten times more than you've made in all your scams. So I'm gonna turn you in and collect the reward. Then you metalbend yourself out of jail, and we're on our way.
How could you do this to me? You betrayed me.
You brought this on yourself. I had no choice.
You did the right thing by turning in "The Runaway".
The right thing is its own reward.
Well, I'm happy to hear you say that.
But... I still want the actual reward.
Of course. Right this way.
Hey, what kind of cell is this?
That's her. That's the girl you were looking for.
Do you think this scam of theirs should be taking this long? 
I was just wondering the same thing. We'd better check it out.    You two behave. Appa's in charge. 
Wait. It's a trap!
Really? No kidding. Is that why we're sitting in a wooden cage right now? Gee, how'd you figure out it was a trap?
Not for us, Katara. We're the bait. He wants Aang.
I can't believe I was so stupid. See, this is exactly why I'm against these scams. I knew this would happen.
But...this was your idea. 
I know. I wanted to show you that I'm not so motherly. I wanted to show you that I can have fun too.
Katara, you are fun. If nothing else, you're at least fun to argue with. 
I know your relationship with your parents is complicated, and I shouldn't have said what I said.
It's ok. I was really mad when you said that because; well, because maybe it's true. I try not to think about it, but when I left, I probably really hurt them.
Where do you think they might be? 
Where do you think anyone is?   Sokka, watch out!   It's "Sparky-Sparky Boom Man"!
You know, I'm starting to think that name doesn't quite fit.
What are we gonna do?
I don't know! I wish we had some earth or water. We need bendables!
What about your meteor bracelet? You could make a saw.
I left it back at camp. I was worried they would take it.  Um, Katara...are you ok?
Just fine.
Well, what are you doing?
I'm making my own water!
Katara, you're a genius! A sweaty, stinky genius!
This guy is too good. He shoots fire from his brain!
We should split up. He can't chase us both.
Aang, get up!
Let's get out of here.
Hey, I got it. The perfect name for that guy! "Combustion Man"!
Good job, Sokka. Now let's get out of here before "Combustion Man" catches us!
See? It fits so well. 
Well, I'm exhausted. Hawky, how about you, buddy?  Yeah, you're such a lazy little bird.
Katara, I need your help.
What is it, Toph?
I need you to write some things down for me. I want to send a letter to my parents.
I'll be happy to help.
Hey, where'd Hawky go?
Aang, it's time you learned my history with Fire Lord Sozin. You need to understand how the war began, if you want to know how to end it. Meet me on my home island on the day of the summer solstice.
Okay, Roku.
You need to know the story of your great-grandfather's demise. It will reveal your own destiny.
There it is. That's Roku's home.
But there's nothing here.
Yes, there is. An entire village. Hundreds
It's never too early for a sitting with the court painter, Zuko.  Make sure he gets your good side.
Wait. I need to ask you something. What do you remember about our Great-Grandfather's history?
Ah, Zuko.  It's so strange how your mind works.  Fire Lord Sozin began the war, of course. He spent his early years secretly preparing for it, but he was as patient as he was clever. He famously waited for the comet, later renamed Sozin's comet, and used its power to launch his full-scale invasion of the world.  In the end, he died a very old and successful man.
But how did he die?
Didn't you pay any attention in school, Zuko? (Azula begins to
What does it mean? (Annoyed, he tosses the
The final testament of Fire Lord Sozin.
Come, Aang. 
Where are we going?
To visit my past. Our shared past.
As I feel my own life dimming, I can't help but think of a time when everything was so much brighter.  I remember my friend. 
Are you kidding?  The tree root did all the work.  Nice one, Sozin. 
You were friends with Fire Lord Sozin?!
Back then, he was just Prince Sozin, and he was my best friend.
Say something to her.
Uh...ahhh. 
Love is hard when you're young.
You don't have to tell me.
Don't worry, It gets better. Now come with me. We have a party to attend. 
Wait, whose party is it?
Sozin and I shared many things, including a birthday.
Did something happen to my father?
Soon the day came when my friend Roku had to leave the Fire Nation and face his destiny as the Avatar. He needed to travel the world so he could master the other elements.
Hey, why aren't you packed yet, all-powerful Avatar?
Come on, show me how it's done... using all four kinds of bending. 
I started packing, but then the fire sages told me I won't need any worldly possessions anymore. 
Oh.
It happened so fast. Everything's going to be different now.
Here.  I hope you're at least allowed to have this.
But this is a royal artifact.  It's supposed to be worn by the crown prince.
I want you to have it.
Do they have bathrooms in the spirit world? 
As a matter of fact, they do not.
Hey, we're almost at the Southern Air Temple.
This was the first stop on my avatar journey.
It was the place where I was trained to master airbending and also where I met an old friend of yours, Monk Gyatso.
No way.
Hey, Gyatso, you want to see a new glider trick? 
Check this out. 
) He's air-surfing. I can't believe I never thought of that.
That's amazing. I can't believe you were friends with Monk Gyatso just like I was. 
Some friendships are so strong,  they can even transcend lifetimes.
After my years mastering airbending, I traveled to the Northern Water Tribe.  Waterbending was especially challenging for me.  But in time, I mastered it as well. 
I moved on to the Earth Kingdom.  My Earthbending master, Sud, was uncompromising, stubborn, and blunt.  ...and a lifelong friend.
It was bitter work...  but the results were worth it. 
Twelve long years passed before I saw my friend again. When Roku returned, he was a fully realized Avatar, and I had changed as well.
Sozin, or should I say, Fire Lord.
Customarily, my subjects bow before greeting me, but you're the exception.
After all these years, he was still my best friend  And a few months later, he was my best man.
Roku, it's that girl who didn't even know you were alive.
Don't do this, Sozin. Don't challenge me. It will only end badly. It's over.
I'm sparing you, Sozin. I'm letting you go in the name of our past friendship, but I warn you, even a single step out of line will result in your permanent end.
Sozin and I didn't speak or see each other for 25 years after our battle. I spent most of my spare time here at my home.
Let's go.
Roku's island was 100 miles away. But I could still feel it rumbling and see the black plume of smoke. I had never seen anything like this catastrophe.
This is amazing, Roku. You're battling a volcano, and you're winning.
Unfortunately, my success didn't last, Aang. There was no way I could do it all.
Battling the elements was hard enough. I had to do it while I could barely breathe. The poisonous, volcanic gasses were overwhelming.
It's all right, Fang. Get out of here, I'm fine.
Need a hand, old friend?
Sozin?!
There's not a moment to waste.
Don't breathe the toxic gas. 
It's... too much.
Please...
Without you, all my plans are suddenly possible.
I have a vision for the future, Roku.
Who's... wait, that's me, isn't it?
Make sense of our past Aang, and you will bring peace and restore balance in the world.
Roku? Roku?
With Roku gone, and the great comet returning, the timing was perfect to change the world. I knew the next avatar would be born an air nomad. So I wiped out the air temples. But somehow, the new Avatar eluded me. I wasted the remainder of my life searching in vain. I know he's hiding out there somewhere. The Fire Nation's greatest threat... the last airbender.
That can't be it, where's the rest of it? 
You sent this, didn't you? I found the secret history. Which, by the way should be renamed "the history most people already know." The note said that I needed to know about my great-grandfather's death, but he was still alive in the end.
No...he wasn't.
What are you talking about?
You have more than one great-grandfather, Prince Zuko. Sozin was your father's grandfather. Your mother's grandfather was Avatar Roku.
Why are you telling me this?
Because understanding the struggle between your two great-grandfathers, can help you better understand the battle within yourself. Evil and good are always at war inside you, Zuko. It is your nature, your legacy. But there is a bright side. What happened generations ago can be resolved now... by you. Because of your legacy, you alone can cleanse the sins of our family and the fire nation. Born in you, along with all this strife, is the power to restore balance to the world.
This is a royal artifact. It's supposed to be worn by the crown prince.
You mean, after all Roku and Sozin went through together... even after Roku showed him mercy, Sozin betrayed him like that?
It's like these people are born bad.
Then what was the point?
Roku was just as much Fire Nation as Sozin was, right? If anything, their story proves anyone's capable of great good and great evil. Everyone, even the Fire Lord and the Fire Nation have to be treated like they're worth giving a chance. And I also think it was about friendships.
Do you really think friendships can last more than one lifetime?
I don't see why not.
Well, scientifically speaking, there's no way to prove that..
Oh, Sokka, just hold hands.
Top of the morning, Momo!
Sounds like you slept well.
Like a baby mooselion. I'm ready  to face the Fire Lord.
So what's your strategy for taking him down? Going to get your glow on  and hit him  with a little Avatar State action? 
I can't. When Azula shot me with lightning, my 7th chakra was locked, cutting off my connection to all the cosmic energy in the Universe.
You know what I just? heard Blah blah spiritual mumbo jumbo blah blah something about Space.
Oh no. Sokka, do you think the fog will delay the invasion?
No, that is the invasion. 
You made it Dad!
Were you able to locate everyone I told you to find?
I did. But I'm a little worried, Sokka.  Some of these men aren't exactly the warrior type.
Whooo-wheee. This place ain't
It's just a rock, Due.
Well, I'll be.
Is it just me, or are those fellas a little loose in the leaf head?
I just wish they would wear pants.
Pants are an illusion and so is death.
Hi, Katara. 
Haru,  it's so good to see you.
(walking towards Haru
Katara inspired me and my Father  to take back our village.
You helped us find our courage, Katara. Now we're here to help you.
No way.  Is that...  
Hippo happy to see Blind Bandit!
You guys here for a re-match?
Negatory. The Boulder and The Hippo no longer fight  for others' entertainment. Now, we fight for our Kingdom! 
Sweet. 
Was that a new invention?
You're making peanut sauce bombs?
They're destructive.
Were you able to complete work on the plans I sent you?
Aang,  my Dad & I made this for you. 
A new glider! This is amazing.
And as a special feature, I added a snack compartment.  
Oh well, I'm sure that will come in handy.
Breakfast.
I snuck in some white jade tea. I know you like rare teas. 
Thank you, Ming.  Ever since I was put in here, you have been very kind to me. 
Don't worry, you'll do great. 
Good morning, everyone! 
Uhm... So, as you know today we're invading the Fire Nation. I mean I know you know that.  Because otherwise why else would you be here Anyway... (Clumsily drops more scrolls. He picks them
Katara and I discovered Aang frozen in an iceberg. Now I didn't like Aang at first but I grew to love him over time. Then we went over to the Southern Air Temple where Aang used to live and then
Wow, he says beginning, he means beginning, beginning.
...and then Aang's friend was a crazy old man and then Katara got Haru arrested and then now he's grown a mustache  and if you look in the front row you can see him...
Thank you, Sokka.  It's okay, why don't you take a break?  Let me just clarify a few points for everyone. Today is the Day of Black Sun  and I want to thank you all for your self sacrifice and your courage.  They're two steps to the invasion. A naval stage and then a land stage. To gain sea access to the Fire Nation capital,  we have to get pass our first major obstacle here.  The Great Gates of Azulon. Next,  we hit the land and we hit hard . We must fight past their battlements and secure the plaza tower . Once we do that,  it's up to the royal palace. At that point, the eclipse will begin. 
Excuse me, The Boulder is confused. Isn't the point to invade during the eclipse? When the firebenders are powerless?
The eclipse only last 8 minutes. Not enough time for the whole invasion and the royal palace is heavily guarded by firebenders. So that's where we'll need the eclipse advantage the most. When this is finished, the Avatar would have defeated the Fire Lord. We would have control of the Fire Nation capital  and this war will be over! 
We've been looking everywhere for you. The boats are ready to leave.
I messed up, Aang. 
What?
The invasion plan was my moment of truth. And I completely flopped it. I just fell apart.
Sokka,  that speech wasn't your moment of truth. That was just public speaking and nobody's really good at that.
My Dad is. He explained the plan perfectly and inspired everyone. Like a real leader should. 
Look, your moment of truth isn't going to be in front of some map. It's going to be out there,  on the battlefield. 
You seem so confident about everything. How do you know we're going to win?
Because I already failed the world once at Ba Sing Se. I won't let myself fail again. 
There they are.  The Great Gates of Azulon.
I don't see any gates. 
Katara, you and the swamp benders whip up a fog cover.
We'll sneak by that statues just like we sneaked by that fire navy blockade. 
Keep it up, we're almost through.
Everyone below deck.  Let's hope your invention works. 
You really outdone yourself this time, son.
Yeah. Congratulations, Sokka.  You managed to invent a worst way of travel than flying. 
Well, I just came up with the idea but The Mechanist did all the work. 
Lunchtime, General Iroh.  And this time, I brought you an extra bowl of rice.
Thank you, Ming. Your little gestures of kindness had made my days in prison bearable.  I think you should take the rest of the day off. 
What? 
You don't look well.  Maybe you should go home and rest. 
No, I feel fine. 
Trust me.  It is better that you are not here this afternoon. 
So, this is it huh?
Are you ready for the Fire Nation to know the Avatar's alive? 
I'm ready. 
I hope you kick some serious Fire Lord butt, twinkle toes.
Everyone listen up.  The next time we resurface, it'll be on the beaches. So stay alert and fight smart. Now break time's over, back in the subs. 
Aang, I.
Katara, I.
You go first.
We've been through so many things together and I've seen you grow up so much. You're not that little goofy kid  I found in the iceberg anymore. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm really proud of you. 
Everything is going to be different after today, isn't it? 
Yes, it is. 
What if... what if I don't come back?
Aang, don't say that. Of course you'll... 
Katara, what are you doing? It's time to submerge.
What? Right, I'm on it. 
I'm sorry, Mai. 
What did you know? It did come in handy. 
Everyone in position. Earthbenders, into your tanks.  This is going to be a rough ride.
Ready the torpedo. 
Launch! 
We're a man down. Where in tarnation is Hue?
Hey Hue,  where you been?
Communing with nature. Takes a while to collect these
Dad, look out!
Sokka, we've got to take out those battlements. It's our only chance. 
I've got an idea. 
You two take out that battlement. I've got this one. Watch each other's backs. 
Dad?
Dad! 
I know I made some bad choices. But today, I'm going to set things right. 
How does that feel, Dad?
A... a little better.  I need... to get back... to the troops. 
You're hurt. Badly. You can't fight anymore. 
Everyone's counting on me  to lead this mission, Katara. I won't let them down. 
Can't you heal him any faster? 
I'm doing everything I can. 
I'll do it.
No offense Sokka but you're not exactly Mr. Healing Hands.
No.  I'll lead the invasion force. 
Don't be crazy, Sokka.
Maybe I am a little crazy but the eclipse is about to start and we need to be up that volcano  by the time it does.
You can do this. I'm proud of you, son. 
I still think you're crazy but I'm proud of you too. 
Yip yip. 
Listen up everyone,  I want the tanks in wedge formation!  Warriors and benders in the middle.  We're taking that tower  and headed for the royal palace! 
Charge! 
That's strange. 
The Avatar is back! 
Hello?  Anyone home?
The Fire Nation is falling back! 
Sokka, we're on our way to victory. 
No...  No, no,  NO! Fire Lord Ozai,  where are you?! 
Who's there? 
I think I see a cave below.
Shhush... keep quiet!  Great job with the cloud camo, but next time, let's disguise ourselves as the kind of cloud who knows how to keep its mouth shut.
Yeah, we wouldn't want a bird to hear us chatting up there and turn us in.
Hey! We're in enemy territory. Those are enemy birds. 
Well, this is it. This is how we'll be living until the invasion begins. Hiding in cave after cave...after cave...after cave... 
Sokka, we don't need to become cave people. What we need is some new clothes.
Yeah, blending in is better than hiding out. If we get Fire Nation disguises, we'll be just as safe as we would be hiding in a cave.
Plus...they have real food out there. Does anyone wanna sit in the dirt and eat cave-hoppers? 
Looks like we got out voted, sport.  Let's get some new clothes.
I don't know about this. These clothes belong to somebody.
But if it's essential to our survival...then I call the suit!
Ta-dah! Normal kid.
Hmm...I should probably wear shoes, but then I won't be able to see as well. Sorry shoes!  Finally, a stylish shoe for the blind earthbender.
Uh...your mom's necklace.
Oh...oh, yeah. I guess it's pretty obviously water tribe, isn't it?
I used to visit my friend Kuzon here a hundred years ago. So everyone just follow my lead and stay cool. Or as they say in the Fire Nation - "Stay flamin'"!  Greetings, my good Hotman!
Oh, we're going to a meat place?
Come on, Aang. Every one here eats meat...even the meat!
You guys go ahead. I'll just get some lettuce out of the garbage.
Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman.
Who me?
Heh, heh. Uh! 
That's right.  Let the molding begin.
Yeah, the colonies. Of course. The Fire Nation colonies in the Earth Kingdom.
Sorry ma'am.
Um, I have a scar. It's really embarrassing.
Just "Slob" is fine.  Or, uh... Kuzon. 
We made it through the day, Momo. And...it was pretty fun!
What monkey?
On Ji, you don't have to baby-sit the new kid.
Wow.  You must be one of those popular kids I've been hearing about.
That's right. Now listen, friend...I know you're from the colonies, so I'll say this slowly.  On Ji...is...my...girlfriend. Don't forget it.
It was nice meeting you.
I guess I'm just lucky.
We were on our way to play hide-and-explode. You wanna come?
I'd love to!
Where have you been? We've been worried sick!
I got invited to play with some kids after school.
After what?
I enrolled in a Fire Nation school, and I'm going back tomorrow.
Enrolled in what?!
You again? Stop where you are.  Prince Zuko?!  Ugh!
I'm going in for a visit. You're gonna stand guard here, and no one is going to know about this.
Uncle. It's me.
Aang, I'm trying to be mature and not immediately shoot down your idea. But it sounds...really terrible.
Yeah, we got our outfits. What do you need to go to school for?
Every minute I'm in that classroom. I'm learning new things about the fire nation. I already have a picture of Fire Lord Ozai. 
Impressive, I admit. But I still think it's too dangerous. 
I guess we'll never find out about the secret river then. It goes right to the Fire Lord's palace. We were supposed to learn about it in class tomorrow...
Hmm... I am a fan of secret rivers.  Fine, let's stay a few more days.
Flamey-o, Hotman! 
Flamey-o??
Mmm-mm?
You brought this on yourself, you know. We could have returned together. You could have been a hero!  You have no right to judge me Uncle. I did what I had to do in Ba Sing Se, and you're a fool for not joining me.  You're not gonna say anything?  Argh! You're a crazy old man! You're crazy, and if you weren't in jail, you'd be sleeping in a gutter!
My life, I give to my country. With my hands, I fight for Fire Lord Ozai and our forefathers before him...
Fire Lord...forefathers...
With my mind, I seek ways to better my country, and with my feet...
Firebenders...Fire Lord...blah, blah, blah, blah.
Is that a trick question? The Air Nomads didn't have a formal military. Sozin defeated them by ambush.
I'll just write down my best guess.
I know. I'm a terrible Tsungi hornist.
I was just dancing. You do dances here in the homeland, right?
Not really, no.
But what about expressing yourself?
Thanks, On Ji. I could show it to you again, if you'd like.
What'd you say, colony trash? You're gonna show her something? 
Just some dance movements.
Nobody shows my On Ji anything, especially movements.
Parents? But...
Fire! Wang Fire. This is my wife, Sapphire.
Sapphire Fire, nice to meet you.
My goodness! That doesn't sound like our Kuzon.
Don't you worry, Mr. Headmaster. I'll straighten this boy out somethin' fierce.  Young man, as soon as we get home, you're gonna get the punishment of a lifetime!
Orange is such an awful color.
You're so beautiful when you hate the world.
I don't hate you.
I don't hate you, too. 
Ahem!  Zuko, could I have a word with you?
Can't you see we're busy? 
Oh, Mai... Ty Lee needs your help untangling her braid.
Sounds pretty serious. 
So...I hear you've been to visit your Uncle Fatso in the
That guard told you. 
No, you did. Just now.
Okay, you caught me. What is it that you want, Azula?
Actually, nothing. Believe it or not, I'm looking out for you. If people find out you've been to see Uncle, they'll think you're plotting with him. Just be careful, dum-dum.
That settles it. No more school for you young man!
I'm not ready to leave. I'm having fun for once, just being a normal kid. You don't know what it's like, Sokka. You get to be normal all the time.
Ha, ha.
Listen, guys, those kids at school are the future of the Fire Nation. If we wanna change this place for the better, we need to show them a little taste of freedom.
What could you possibly do for a country of depraved little fire monsters?
I'm gonna throw them...(he does a quick tap dance flourish ...a secret dance party!
I can't believe we're having a dance party. It seems so... silly.
Don't think of it as a dance party, but as a cultural event celebrating the art of fancy footwork.
They're coming! Everyone stop bending!
Sorry, buddy. You should probably wait out back.  I know, you've got fancier feet than anybody...and six of 'em!
Ladies and gentlemen, The Flamey-os! Yeah, this ought to get everybody moving.
Now what do we do?
This is when you start dancing.
Oh, boy. Listen, guys...dancing isn't something you think about. It's a form of self-expression that no one can ever take away from you.
Maybe it was different in the colonies, Kuzon. But we don't do that here.
Sure you do. You have for generations. It just so happens that I know several classic fire nation dances. A hundred years ago, this was known as "The Phoenix Flight."
And this was the "Camelephant Strut".
Who knew Twinkletoes could dance? 
I brought you some komodo-chicken. I know you don't care for it, but I figure it beats prison food.  I admit it. I have everything I always wanted, but it's not at all how I thought it would be. The truth is, I need your advice.  I think the Avatar is still alive. I know he's out there. I'm losing my mind.  Please, Uncle, I'm so confused! I need your help.  Forget it! I'll solve this myself! Waste away in here for all I care!
And this is how they do it in the ballrooms of Ba Sing Se.
Wow, they look pretty good together.
Eh, if that's what you like.
Yeah, that's it. That's the sound of happy feet. All right, go with that. Everybody freestyle!
I don't know, Aang. These shoes aren't really right for dancing, and I'm not sure that I know how to...
Take my hand.
Okay. 
Aang, everyone's watching.
Don't worry about them. It's just you and me right now.
Anytime, Headmaster, sir.
He's the one we want.  The boy with the headband!
Uh-oh.
Got ya!
Looking for me?
Do you need something?
Over here.
Stop that. Stop that! 
We're safe, Sokka. You can take off the moustache, now.
Oh, no, I can't. It's permanently glued to my skin. 
Way to go, Dancypants. I think you really did help those kids. You taught them to be free.
I don't know. It was just a dance party, that's all.
Well, that was some dance party, Aang.
Flamey-o, sir. Flame-ee-o.
You're sure you weren't followed?  I've heard about you. They say you're good at what you do. And even better at keeping secrets. The Avatar's alive. I want you to find him.  And end him.
I missed you more than you'll ever know, buddy.
Look, we escaped from the Dai Li, we got Appa back, I'm telling you, we should go to the Earth King now and tell him our plan. We're on a roll.
One good hour after weeks of trouble isn't much of a roll.
We can build on it. If we want to invade the Fire Nation when the eclipse happens, we need the Earth King's support. 
What makes you think we'll get it? I don't know if you've noticed, but things don't usually go that smoothly for our little gang. 
I know, but I've got a good feeling about this. This time will be different.
Sokka, Long Feng is control of the city. His conspiracy with the Dai Li is too powerful. I think we should just keep flying and leave this horrible place behind us.
I'm with sweetness. I've seen enough of Ba Sing Se,  and I can't even see!
But now that we have Appa back, there is nothing stopping us from telling the Earth King the truth about the conspiracy and the war.
See, Aang's with me.  It's the whole reason we came here in the first place, we have to try. 
Well, I guess if the Earth King knew the truth, things could change. 
I don't trust the new positive Sokka.  Long Feng brainwashed you, didn't he!
That's probably the Dai Li searching for us.  So?
Let's fly!
Can we please buy a new saddle? Riding bareback is terrifying! 
There it is. That whole thing is the palace. The Earth King's chambers should be in the center. 
We have to be careful. Long Feng's probably warned the King that we're coming.
Why would you assume that? If you ask me, I think we're just gonna sail right in....Ahhh! 
What was that?!
Surface to air rocks!  More incoming! Ahhh!
Sorry! 
Sorry! We just need to get through to see the Earth King. 
Seriously, we're actually on your guys' side.  Sorry.
In there. 
Toph, which way to the Earth King?
How should I know? I'm still voting that we leave Ba Sing Se.
Sorry, wrong door.
You did the right thing, letting the Avatar's bison go free. 
I don't feel right.
Zuko! 
Now that's an impressive door. It's gotta go somewhere.
A little warning next time! 
We need to talk to you!
No, we're on your side. We're here to help.
You have to trust us.
He has a good point.
See, we're friends, your Earthiness.
But we dropped our weapons. We're your allies.
Uh, no, him. 
Well, sir, there is a war going on right now. For the past 100 years, in fact. The Dai  Li's kept it secret from you. It's a conspiracy to control the city, and to control you.
Long Feng didn't want us to tell you, so he stole our Sky Bison to blackmail us. And blackmail is the least of his crimes, he brain washed our friend!
Wait, I can prove he's lying. Long Feng said he's never seen a Sky Bison, ask him to lift his robe.
Right there! Appa bit him.
Never met a Sky Bison , huh?
Of course there is!
Yeah! Woo!
Awww.
Uh, ok, we'll take it. Yeah.
You're burning up. You have an intense fever.  This will help cool you down.
So thirsty. 
Here's some clean water to drink.  Stay under the blankets, and sweat this out.
So you've never been outside the upper ring before?
Underneath Lake Laogai, Your Kingliness. To the Dai Li's secret headquarters. You're about to see where all the brainwashing and conspiring took place.
It's gone!
Oh, don't tell me..  That's ok, still got my positive attitude.
The Dai Li must have known we were coming and destroyed the evidence.
Hey, if anything, this proves the conspiracy exists even more.
The wall! They'll never be able to cover that up in time!
Oh yeah.  If you come with us to the outer wall, we can prove to you that the secret war is real!
If you come with us, this time you can ride on Appa. 
First time flying?
Yeah, I hate it too.
I wish it wasn't.
I'm not tired.
Zuko, help me!
It's still there!
It's a drill. A giant drill made by the Fire Nation, to break through your walls.
Really Then perhaps you can explain why there's a Fire Nation insignia on your construction project. 
Looks like Long Feng is "long gone"! Ha...Oh, yeah, I've been waitin' to use that one. 
That's why we came to Ba Sing Se, Your Highness. Because we think you can help us end the war. 
We don't have much time. There's a comet coming this summer. Its energy will give the fire benders unbelievable strength. They'll be unstoppable. 
But there is hope. Before the comet comes, we have a window of opportunity. A solar eclipse is coming. The sun will be entirely blocked out by the moon, and the fire benders will be helpless. 
That's the day we need to invade the Fire Nation. The Day of Black Sun.
You're already vulnerable. The Fire Nation won't stop until Ba Sing Se falls. You can either sit back and wait for that to happen, or take the offensive, and give yourself a fighting chance.  
Woo! Alright! Good work team! 
Secret files?
It's a letter from your mom. You mom's here in the city, and she wants to see you. 
Long Feng intercepted our letters from home? That's just sad.
It's from the Eastern Air Temple.
Is there a letter for me and Sokka by any chance?
Oh.
A small fleet of water tribe ships...
What? That could be Dad.
Protecting the mouth of Chameleon Bay, led by Hakoda. It is Dad!
You should know this is not a natural sickness. But that shouldn't stop you from enjoying tea. 
What? What's happening?
You're critical decision, what you did beneath that lake...it was in such conflict with your image of yourself, that you are now at war within your own mind and body. 
What's that mean 
You're going through a metamorphosis, my nephew. It will not be a pleasant experience, but when you come out of it, you will be the beautiful Prince you were always meant to be. 
I can't believe it. There's a man living at the Eastern Air Temple. He says he's a Guru. 
What's a Guru? Some kind of poisonous blowfish? 
No, a spiritual expert. He wants to help me take the next step in the Avatar journey. He says he can teach me to control the Avatar State.
And I can't believe we know where our Dad is now. 
I know what you mean. My Mom's in the city, and from her letter it sounds like she finally understands me.
This is all such big news. Where do we even start?
I hate to say it, but...we have to split up.
Split up? We just found Appa and got the family back together. Now you want us to separate? 
You have to meet this Guru, Aang. If we're gonna invade the Fire Nation, you need to be ready.
Well, if I'm going to the Eastern Air Temple. Appa and I can drop you at Chameleon Bay to see your Dad.
Someone has to stay here with the Earth King and help him plan for the invasion. I guess that's me? 
No Sokka, I know how badly you want to help Dad. You go to Chameleon Bay, I'll stay here with the king.
You are...the nicest... sister...ever. 
Easy there, big brother.  Though you're right, I am.
Katara, I need to tell you something. I've been wanting to say it for a long time. 
What is it Aang?
Katara, I...
Alright! Who's ready to get going on our little men-only man trip 
Your Majesty. There are three female warriors here to see you, they're from the island of Kyoshi.
That's Suki!! 
Oh yeah. The Kyoshi warriors are a skilled group of fighters, trust worthy too. They're good friends of ours.
Wait, Aang. 
I'm really gonna miss you guys.
Me too.
Yeah.
Ahhh! Great! That's enough! Ok, we love each other.   Seriously.
Ahhhh! 
You see Aang, a little positive thinking works wonders. We got the King on our side, we got Long Feng arrested, and when we get back, Suki's waiting for me.
Yeah, girls are waiting for us. Thanks "positive attitude".
Everything's gonna work out perfectly, from now on and forever. 
Hello? Mom? Anyone home? 
Hey! Who do you think you're dealing with?! 
We are the Earth King's humble servants.
We found a printer to make our posters. 
Hey, I thought designing "the lost Appa poster" was my job. I've been working all day on my Appa. 
Sokka, the arrow is on Appa's head. 
This IS his head.
Those are his horns!  I haven't seen him awhile ok?! 
It looks just like him to me.
Thank you, I worked really...  Why do you feel the need to do that?
Let's just stick with the professional version.
Grrrr! 
Come on, let's get busy! 
So you're the genius behind this incredible brew. The whole city is buzzing about you.  I hope Pao pays you well.
Good tea is its own reward.
But it doesn't have to be the only reward. How would you like to have your own tea shop?
My own tea shop? This is a dream come true.
What's going on here? Are you trying to poach my tea maker? 
Sorry Pao, that's business for you, am I right? 
Mushie, if you stay, I will make you Assistant Manager. Wait, Senior Assistant manager. 
I'll provide you with a new apartment in the upper ring. The Tea shop is yours to do whatever you want.  Complete creative freedom.
I even get to name the shop?
Of course!
Uh, Senior Executive Assistant Manager?
Did you hear nephew? This man wants to give us our own tea shop in the upper ring of the city.
That's right young man. Your life is about to change for the better.
I'll try to contain my joy. 
I just finished dropping all the leaflets. Has anyone come in with news about Appa?
It's only been a day, just be patient. 
Wow, you're right! Patience really pays off.  Joo Dee?!
What happened to you? Did the Dai Li throw you in jail?
But you disappeared at the Earth King's party.
But then they replaced you with some other woman who also said her name was Joo Dee.
Why are you here?
We can't wait around to get permission for everything. 
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE RULES, AND WE'RE NOT ASKING PERMISSON!!  We're finding Appa on our own and you should just stay out of our way! 
That might come back to bite us in the blubber.
I don't care. From now on we do whatever it takes to find Appa.
YEAH! Let's break some rules! 
So, I was thinking about names for my new tea shop. How ;bout the Jasmine Dragon? It's dramatic, poetic, has a nice ring to it. 
The Avatar's here in Ba Sing Se.  And he's lost his bison. 
We have a chance for a new life here.  If you start stirring up trouble, we could lose all the good things that are happening for us.
Good things that are happening for you. Have you ever thought that I want more from life than a nice apartment and a job serving tea?
There is nothing wrong with a life of peace and prosperity. I suggest you think about what it is that you want for your life, and why.
I want my destiny.
What that means is up to you.  The Tea Weevil!  No, that's stupid.
Well split up to cover more area. Toph, I guess you should just come with me.
Why because you think I can't put up posters on my own? 
It's upside-down isn't it? I'll just go with Sokka. 
Katara? 
I think I can help you.
Katara! I've changed!
Tell it to some other girl, Jet! 
I don't want to fight you! I'm here to help. 
Katara, what is it?
Jet's back.
We can't trust anything Jet says.
But we don't even know why he's here.
I don't care why he's here. Whatever the reason is, it can't be good.
I'm here to help you find Appa. 
Katara, we have to give him a chance.
I swear, I've changed. I was a troubled person, and I let my anger get out of control. But I don't even have the gang now. I've put all that behind me.
You're lying! 
He's not lying. 
How can you tell?
I can feel his breathing and heart beat. When people lie, there is a physical reaction. He's telling the truth. 
Katara, we don't have any leads. If Jet says he can take us to Appa, we have to check it out. 
Alright...  but we're not letting you out of out sight! 
This is the place I heard about. 
There's nothing here.
If this is a trap...! 
I told you, I work nearby! Two guys were talking about some giant furry creature they had. I figured it must be Appa. 
He was here! 
We missed him.
They took that big thing yesterday.  Shipped him out to some island. About time, I've been cleaning up fur and various, uh leavings all day. 
What island?! Where's Appa?!
Foreman said some rich royal type on Whaletail Island bought him up, guess for a zoo or such, though could be the meat would be good.
We've gotta get to Whaletail Island.  Where's Whaletail Island?
Far. Very far.  Here it is. It's near the South Pole almost all the way back home.  
Aang, It'll take us weeks just to get to the tip of the Earth Kingdom. And then we'll need to find a boat to get to the island.
I don't care. We have a chance to find Appa. We have to try.
Must be nice to visit an island. I haven't had a vacation for years. 
Don't you have some more hair to clean up?
Shuffle on, I get ya. No more need for "old sweepy."
You're right Aang.  Right now, our first concern has to be finding Appa. We can come back when we have him.
All right, let's get moving.
I'll come with you.
We don't need you help. 
Why won't you trust me? 
Gee, I wonder? 
Was this guy your boyfriend or something?
What? No! 
I can tell you're lyyyyying. 
We can take the train out to the wall, but then we'll have to walk.
Don't worry, on the way back, we'll be flying!
We're finally leaving Ba Sing Se.  Worst city ever!
Jet!
I thought you said you didn't have your gang anymore?
I don't. 
We were so worried. How did you get away from the Dai Li?
The Dai Li?!
I don't know what she's talking about? 
He got arrested by the Dai Li a couple weeks ago. We saw them drag him away.
Why would I be arrested? I've been living peacefully in the city.
This doesn't make any sense. They're both telling the truth.
That's impossible.
No, it's not. Toph can't tell who's lying because they both think they're telling the truth. Jet's been brainwashed. 
That's crazy! It can't be.  Stay away from me.
The Dai Li must have sent Jet to mislead us, and that janitor was part of their plot too.
I bet they have Appa here in the city. Maybe he's in the same place they took Jet.  Where did they take you? 
Nowhere.  I, I don't know what you're talking about. 
We need to find a way to jog his real memories. 
Maybe Katara could kiss him. That should bring something back. 
Maybe you should kiss him, Sokka.
Hey, just an idea.
A bad one.
Oo, wait. I got it. 
I don't think its working. Puh! 
Try to think of something from your past that triggers your emotions. 
The Fire Nation, remember what they did to your family.
Close your eyes. Picture it.
No! It's too painful.
Maybe this will help.
They took me to a headquarters under the water, like a lake. 
Wait! Remember what Joo Dee said?  She said she went on vacation to Lake Laogai.
That's it! Lake Laogai.
So where's this secret headquarters?
Under the lake I think. 
There's a tunnel right there near the shore. 
It's all starting to come back to me.
I think there might be a cell big enough to hold Appa up ahead.  I think it's through here. 
Now that's something different.
Long Feng is escaping! 
You do have Appa. Tell me where he is!
You're in no position to bargain.
You're definitely not!
I am honored to except his invitation.
So, the Blue Spirit. I wonder who could be behind that mask?
What are you doing here?
I was just about to ask you the same thing. What do you plan to do now that you have found the Avatar's bison? Keep it locked in our new apartment? Should I go put on a pot of tea for him?
First I have to get it out of here.
AND THEN WHAT?! You never think these things through! This is exactly what happened when you captured the Avatar at the North Pole! You had him, and then you had no where to go! 
I would have figured something out!
No!! If his friends hadn't found you, you would have frozen to death!
I know my own destiny uncle.
Is it your own destiny? Or is it a destiny someone else has tried to force on you?
Stop it Uncle. I have to do this. 
I'm begging you Prince Zuko! It's time for you to look inward, and begin asking yourself the big questions. Who are you? And what do you want?
Jet, it's me Aang! You don't have to do this.
Jet, I'm your friend! Look inside your heart! 
He can't make you do this! You're a Freedom Fighter.
I'm sorry, Aang.
Don't be.
This isn't good.
You guys go find Appa. We'll take care of Jet.
We're not going to leave you.
There's no time. Just go. We'll take care of him. He's our leader. 
Don't worry Katara, I'll be fine. 
He's lying.
Appa's gone. Long Feng beat us here. 
If we keep moving, maybe we can catch up to him. 
Do you think we can out run them?
I don't think it's gonna matter.
What is it Momo? 
Appa!
Yeah! Appa!
I missed you, buddy.
You did the right thing, nephew.  Leave it behind.
What's that smell?  
It's jook. I'm sure you wouldn't like it.  
Actually, it smells delicious. I'd love a bowl, Uncle. 
Now that your fever is gone, you seem different somehow.  
It's a new day. We've got a new apartment, new furniture, and today's the grand opening of your new tea shop. Things are looking up Uncle. 
You haven't seen your Dad in over two years. You must be so excited.
I know I should be, but I just feel sick to my stomach. 
Don't be nervous, he's going to be so happy to see you. 
So what about you? Are you nervous to meet this Guru? 
Sokka.
Hi Dad.
It's terrible when you can't trust the people who are closest to you.
Really? Now that sounds like a fascinating and brilliant plan. 
Or we could send in Momo to do some damage. 
I'll get these scrolls to him right away. Thank you, General How. 
Um, hello?  You're Guru Pathik, right? The person who attached the note to Appa's horn? 
Ugh! It tastes like onion and banana juice!
Hey! Can you two old ladies quit your bickering for a second? I gotta go to the bathroom! 
Let me out of here, so I can kick both your butts! 
We have been presented with an extraordinary opportunity, girls.
Ha. Ha. 
I'm talking about conquering the whole Earth Kingdom. 
From the inside we're in the perfect position to organize a coup and overthrow the Earth King. The key is the Dai Li. Whoever controls the Dai Li, controls Ba Sing Se. 
What are chakras?
So chakras are pools of spiraling energy in our bodies?
The creek can't flow?
The energy flows! 
I'll do whatever it takes.
Ahhhhh! 
Water chakra?
I hurt all of those people.
This bay leads directly to the outskirts of Ba Sing Se. We've been using these tangle mines to stop the fire nation ships from getting through.
Your father invented tangle mines himself. 
Destructive, buoyant, and  terrible smelling.
Very perceptive. The mines are filled with skunk-fish and seaweed.  When a ship detonates the mine, the seaweed tangles up the propeller, and the foul smell forces people to abandon the ship. I call it the stink-n-sink.
Ha ha! Good one Dad!
You are definitely your father's son.
Bato, get these mines loaded up. The rest of you men, prepare for battle! 
Uh, what should I do, Dad?
Aren't you listening? I said the rest of you men get ready for battle.
Who thought when we came to this city as refugees, that I'd end up owning my own tea shop. Follow your passion Zuko, and life will reward you.
Congratulations Uncle.
I'm very thankful.
You deserve it. The Jasmine Dragon will be the best tea shop in the city.
No, I'm thankful because you decided to share this special day with me.  It means more than you know. 
Now let's make these people some tea.
Yes! Let's make some tea!
My Fire chakra would like to eat something other than onion-banana juice.
I'm never going to fire bend again. I can't.
Urrp! Tastes like onion and bananas, but strangely something else. Pickles?
I'm tired of wearing this girly disguise. I don't know how anyone can fight in this.
How much longer do we have to serve the Earth King? If I have to clean up one more pile of bear poop, I'm gonna throw up.
Shush up! Do you want the whole palace to know we're Fire Nation? 
Good work girls.  I am sure the Dai Li will deliver the message. 
Can I have some onion banana juice please?
Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar? 
Because I never wanted to be.
Like the four nations. 
We're all connected.  Everything is connected.
Come on metal.... budge. 
Whoo! Toph, you rule! 
What do you say Momo? A cup of tea before we get back to the king?  Table for two please.
Uncle, I need two jasmine, one green and one lychee! 
I'm brewing as fast as I can! 
This is the last chakra isn't it?
Let's do this.
What? Why would I let go of Katara? I...I..I love her.
Why would I choose cosmic energy over Katara? How could it be a bad thing that I feel an attachment to her? Three chakras ago, that was a good thing.
Thank goodness you are here, Suki. Something terrible is going on. The Fire Nation has infiltrated the city. I just saw Prince Zuko and his Uncle!  We have to tell the Earth King right away!
Oh, don't worry. I'll be sure to let him know. 
So, Zuzu's in the city too. I think it's time for a family reunion. 
I'm sorry, but I can't let go of Katara.
Okay, I'll try.
Katara is in danger! I have to go. 
It's not! It's the real deal! 
Ready to go knock some Fire Nation heads?
You don't know how much this means to me dad. I'll make you proud, and I'll finally prove to you what a great warrior I am.
Sokka, you don't have to prove anything to me.  I'm already proud of you, and I've always known you were a great warrior.
Really?
Why do you think I trusted you to look after our tribe when I left?
This can't be good news.
What is this about? Your agents show up in the middle of the night and drag me down here? You will not treat a Kyoshi Warrior this way! 
What do you want?
Oh? 
Why should I help you?
I'm listening. 
A message from the royal palace. 
I...I can't believe it. 
What is it Uncle?
Great news! We've been invited to serve tea to the Earth King! 
No, stop sinking!
Don't make me put this down! 
Put a muzzle on him!
I'm sorry Appa. 
Ransack his saddle. Who knows what treasures are stashed in there? 
He's tied up good, he can't hurt you.
What's your father going to do when he finds out we lost a sand sailor?
Nothing.  It's the one we stole from the Hammi tribe.  Did you empty the saddle?  That's it! Nothing but garbage!  Ahh! It doesn't matter. We'll still make a profit from selling him to those beetle-headed merchants! 
Uhhhh, pretty good.
Uh, most of the time.
Appa! Appa! 
He's your problem now. Ha ha ha! 
Appa!  No... NOOOO!
Ugh! I guess this mean we'll always be together. 
Always.
AAhhh! It's some kind of monster! 
Huh!
Uncle? What are you looking at? Is there something out there?
Uh, it's nothing. Go back to sleep. 
Wait. Let me see that.  No. It couldn't be.
Huh? Appa? Oh no.
It's gonna be ok Appa. I have to leave, but I am gonna be back soon with help. 
No sudden movements. He's been lost for awhile, and he looks like he's hurt. He's shy around people and scared. Stay low, and stay quiet.
Yes, so he can't be too far from here. It's our responsibility to get Appa back to him safely. This could be our most important mission yet. 
Give him some space!  Appa, it's me, Suki. I'm a friend.  I want to help you. You're hurt. We can help you feel better. And we can help you find Aang. 
My, my, you're easy to find.  It's really astounding my brother hasn't captured you yet. 
What do you want with us?
Who are you, the Avatar's fan girls?
If you are looking for the Avatar, you're out of luck.
I knew this was a waste of time.
No Avatar huh?  Well that's ok, any friend of the Avatar, is an enemy of mine.
You're so colorful, it's making me nauseous.
Afraid of fire I see. That's good, you should be!
Go Appa! Fly away from here! Get out of here.
Get out of here! You have to find Aang! We'll be ok!
Don't you know that fans just make flames stronger?
Hello. I am Guru Pathik. 
I know I am not the person you expected. And I didn't expect to be licked by a giant tongue just now. The world is full of surprises.
Oh, dear. You've been through so much recently. Hurt and betrayed, so twisted up inside.  You're still full of love.  But fear has moved in where trust should be.  I've been expecting you and the young Avatar for quite a long time. I had a vision many years ago of helping him. That's why I came to the Eastern Air Temple  Ahh. Your emotions are so turbulent. Like swirling storm clouds..  Let the clouds in your mind be gentle, peaceful ones. 
Someone looks very well-rested, judging by your bed head. 
I have prepared a message for Aang. May I attach it to your horn?  You and the Avatar's energies are mixed. You have an unbreakable bond. By reading your energy,  I can sense where Aang is.  Funny, what invisible strings connect us all.
I will see you again, great beast.
Huh! Toph, aren't you gonna to get ready for the day?
I'm ready.
You're not gonna wash up? You've got a little dirt on your... everywhere actually.
You call it dirt. I call it a healthy coating of earth.
Hmmm. You know what we need? A girl's day out!
Do I have to?
It'll be fun.
The Fancy Lady Day Spa? Sounds like my kinda place.
Are you ready for some serious pampering?
Sure Katara, whatever you say. As long as they don't touch my feet.
Arrrr! Rrrrr! Errrr!
Well, that wasn't so bad. I'm not usually into that stuff, but I actually feel... girly.
I'm glad, it's about time we did something fun together.
Thanks.
Don't listen to them, let's just keep walking.
I think she looks cute. Like that time we put that sweater on your pet poodle monkey.
Let's go Toph.
No, no. That was a good one! "Like your poodle-monkey"... Ha ha! You know what else is a good one?
Ahhh!
Now that was funny.
Those girls don't know what they're talking about.
It's ok. One of the good things about being blind is I don't have to waste my time worrying about appearances.  I don't care what I look like. I'm not looking for anyone's approval. I know who I am. 
That's what I really admire about you, Toph. You're so strong and confident and self assured. And I know it doesn't matter, but... you're really pretty.
I am?
Yeah. You are.
I'd return the compliment, but I have no idea what you look like.

Thank you, Katara. 
Ow!
If this is for a romantic picnic, may I suggest this lavender one?
No, it is not a romantic picnic, but it is a special occasion.  The moonflower likes partial shade.
Wahh!
Shhh. It's ok. Shhh.

Yeowch!
Hahaha!
It is usually best to admit mistakes when they occur, and to seek to restore honor-
-but not this time. Run!
You. Give me all your money!
What are you doing?
I'm mugging you!
With that stance?
Wha- What are you talking about? Just give me your money, old man!
With a poor stance you are unbalanced, and you can be easily knocked over.
Ugh!
With a solid stance, you are a much more serious threat.  Much better! But to tell you the truth, you do not look like the criminal type.
I know. I'm... I'm just confused.
So you really think I could be a good masseur?
Of course!
This is so great! No one has ever believed in me.
While it is always best to believe in one's self, a little help from others can be a great blessing.
Happy Birthday my son.  If only I could have helped you. 
Hey there, fella. You look hungry.  Ahh!
Hm! They are hungry.  The Dai Li won't give me any money because the kids stopped coming. And the kids won't come because my zoo's nasty and broke.
What kind of animal is that?
Oh, that's rabbiroo. I wish I could get her a big open prairie like she likes.  I'd let her hop her way to happiness.
Let's do it!
Say again?
There's a big open space right outside the walls of the city.
But how are you gonna transport all these wild critters?
Don't worry. I'm great with animals.
This was so much easier in my head!
But you have to open this gate!
Or that!
Well, Mr. Zookeeper, how do you like your new facilities?
Excellent job, Avatar. You should think about working with animals for a living.
On second thought,  you should probably stick to saving people.

What's this?
Ahh, poetry.
Oooh!
I am so sorry. Something struck me in the rear. I just... wound up... here?

They call me Sokka, that is in the Water Tribe,  I am not an oaf.
Ooooh.
You think you're so smart, with your fancy little words, this is not so hard.
Ooooh!
I calls it easy! Like I paddle my canoe,  I'll paddle yours too!

Squish-squash, sling that slang. I'm always right back at ya, like my...  boomerang!

That's right I'm Sokka, it's pronounced with an "okka", young ladies, I rocked ya!
Uh, that's one too many syllables there, bub.
...poetry.
Uncle, we have a problem.  One of the customers is on to us. Don't look now,  but there is a girl over there at the corner table. She knows we're Fire Nation.  Didn't I say don't look!
You're right Zuko. I've seen that girl in here quite a lot.  Seems to me she has quite a little crush on you.
What?!
Thank you for the tea.  What's your name?
My name's Lee. My Uncle and I just moved here.
Hi Lee, my name is Jin. Thank you and, well, I was wondering if you would like to go out sometime?
He'd love to!
Great! I will meet you in front of the shop at sundown.
Hey. Well, look at you.  You look so cute!
It took my Uncle ten minutes to do my hair.
So, how do you like the city so far?
It's ok.
What do you like to do for fun?
Nothing.
Excuse me sir. Would you and your girlfriend care for dessert?
She is not my girlfriend!
You have... quite an appetite for a girl.
Um, thanks So, Lee, where were you and your Uncle living before you came here?
Um, well, we've been traveling around for a long time. 
Oh! Why were you traveling so much?
We were uh, apart of this traveling circus.
Really? What did you do? Wait, lemme guess, you juggled!
Yes. I juggled.
I've always wanted to learn how to juggle. Can you show me something?
Whoah! I haven't practiced for awhile. 
It's alright. Hey, I want to show you one of my favorite places in the city.
I'm so excited for you to see the firelight fountain. The lamps make the water sparkle and reflect in the pool in the most beautiful way. 
I can't believe it! They aren't lit.
Close your eyes and don't peek. 
Ok. Now you can look.
Oh wow...  What happened? How did they light? What did you...? 
I brought you something. It's a coupon for a free cup of tea.
Lee, this is so sweet.
Don't thank me. It was my Uncle's idea. He thinks you're our most valuable customer.
Your Uncle is a good teacher. I have something for you too.  Now it's your turn to close your eyes. 
What's wrong?
It's complicated. I have to go.
How was your night, Prince Zuko?
It was nice.
Look, the inner wall. I can't believe we finally made it to Ba Sing Se in one piece.
Hey don't jinx it! We could still be attacked by some giant, exploding Fire Nation spoon. Or find out the city's been submerged in an ocean full of killer shrimp.
You been hitting the cactus juice again? 
I'm just sayin', weird stuff happens to us.
Don't worry Aang, we'll find Appa.
It's such a big city.
He's a giant bison. Where could someone possibly hide him? Oh.
Back in the city. Great.
What's the problem? It's amazing!
Just a bunch of walls and rules. You wait; you'll get sick of it in a couple of days.
I'm comin' for you buddy. He's here. I can feel it.
Yes. We have information about the Fire Nation army that we need to deliver to the Earth King immediately.
Augh! Maybe you missed what I said. We need to talk to the King about the war, it's important.
What's that wall for?
Why do they have all these poor people blocked off in one part of the city? 
This is why I never came here before. I always heard it was so different from the way the monks taught us to live.
I just want our new place to look nice in case someone brings home a lady friend. 
This city is a prison. I don't want to make a life here.
Life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not. Now come on, I found us some new jobs, and we start this afternoon. 
Look at them, firebenders living right under everyone's nose. 
Jet, you saw a man with a hot cup of tea. It doesn't prove he's a firebender. And what if he is, are we supposed to attack them I thought we were starting over here, changing our ways.
We are, when I get the evidence I need, I'll report them to the police and let them handle it. Ok?
Yeah, we met a Professor from Ba Sing Se University. He took us to an ancient underground library where we discovered information about the war that is absolutely crucial for the King to hear!
Is that woman deaf She only seems to hear every other word I say.
It's called "being handled". Get used to it.
Ridiculous.
Uh, Does this possibly come in a larger size? 
Eeow! This tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice!
Uncle, that's what all tea is.
How can a member of my own family say something so horrible? We'll have to make some major changes around here.
What's inside that wall?
And who are the mean looking guys in robes? 
Can we see the King now? 
A month!
I think we'd enjoy it more if we weren't staying so long. Can't we see the King any sooner? 
If we are going to be here for a month, we should spend our time looking for Appa. 
We don't need a babysitter. 
If someone wanted to sell a stolen animal without anyone knowing, where would they go?
Where's the black market? Who runs it? Come on, you know! 
Hmm, I've never seen any sandbenders or nomads around here. You should ask Professor Zei, he teaches the class on dessert cultures.
Right. And which of your professors could we ask about the war with the Fire Nation? 
Uh, I don't know. I'm not a political science student. I have to get to class. Ugh!
Hey, come with me.
You're the Avatar. I heard you were in town. I'm Pao.
So Pao, what's goin' on with this city? Why is everyone here so scared to talk about the war?
War? scared What do you mean?
I can feel you shaking.
Look, I'm just a minor government official. I've waited 3 years to get this house. I don't want to get into trouble. 
Get in trouble with who? 
Shh, listen, you can't mention the war here, and whatever you do, stay away from the Dai Li.
Would you like a pot of tea? 
We've been working in a tea shop all day. I'm sick of tea!
Sick of tea? That's like being sick of breathing!  Have you seen our spark rocks to heat up the water? 
They're not there.  You'll have to firebend, old man. Where are you going? 
I borrowed our neighbors, such kind people.
I've got it! I know how we're gonna see the Earth King!
How are we supposed to do that? "One doesn't just pop in on the Earth King" .
The King is having a party at the palace tonight for his pet bear. 
You mean Platypus-Bear?
No, it just says "Bear". 
Certainly you mean his pet Skunk-Bear.
Or his Armadillo-Bear.
Gopher-Bear? 
Just..."Bear".
This place is weird. 
The palace will be packed. We can sneak in with the crowd. 
Won't work. 
Why not?
Well, no offense to you simple country folk, but a real society crowd would spot you from a mile away. You've got no manners. 
Excuse me? I've got no manners? You're not exactly lady fancy fingers.
I learned proper society behavior and chose to leave it.  You never learned anything. And frankly, it's a little too late. 
Ah-Ha, but you learned it. You could teach us.
Yeah, I'm mastering every element. How hard could manners be  Good evening, Mr. Sokka Watertribe. Ms. Katara Watertribe. Lord Momo of the Momo Dynasty, your Momo-ness.
Avatar Aang, how you do? Go on. 
Ow!
Katara might be able to pull it off, but you two would be lucky to pass as busboys.
But I feel so fancy.
Earth!
Fire! Augh! Ooh!
Wow, you look beautiful.
Don't talk to the commoners, Katara. First rule of society. 
We'll get in the party, and then find a way to let you in through the side gate.
Jet, we need to talk.
What? Oh great, it's you guys. Where have you been? I could use some help with surveillance here.
We've been talking, and we think you're becoming obsessed with this. It's not healthy. 
Oh, really? You both think this? 
We came here to make a fresh start, but you won't let this go. Even though there's no real proof! 
Well, maybe if you'd help me.
Jet, you've gotta stop this.
Maybe you've forgotten why we need to start over. Maybe you've forgotten about how the Fire Nation left us all homeless? How they wiped out all the people we loved. If you don't want to help me, I'll get the evidence on my own.
This is the best tea in the city!
The secret ingredient is love.
I'm tired of waiting. These two men are firebenders! 
I know they're firebenders! I saw the old man heating his tea!
He works in a tea shop.
He's a firebender, I'm telling you!
Drop your swords boy, nice and easy.
You'll have to defend yourself. Then everyone will know. Go ahead, show them what you can do.
You want a show? I'll give you a show.
Invitation please.
I think this will do.
No entry without an invitation. Step out of line please. 
Look, the Pangs and the Yum Soon Hans are waiting in there for us. I'm going to have to tell them who didn't let me in. 
Step out of line please. 
Sir I'm sorry to bother you, but my cousin lost our invitations.  She's blind. Do you think you could help us? Our family's inside and I'm sure they're very worried. 
I'm Kwa mai, and this is Dung.  Ow!
Um... I don't see 'em right now. But I'm sure we'll find them soon. Thanks for all your help.
Where are they? 
Look, I came up with a backup plan. (picks Momo up by the armpits  We dress Momo like a ghost, OK?  He flies by the guards creating a distraction, then we blast a hole in the wall... 
Or, we could go in with these guys. Toph said we might pass as busboys.
OK, but remember that Momo ghost plan. I think it's a winner. 
You must be getting tired of using those swords. Why don't you go ahead and firebend at me. 
Please son, you're confused. You don't know what you're doing! 
Bet you wish he'd help you out with a little fire blast right now. 
You're the one who needs help. 
You see that? The Fire Nation is trying to silence me. It'll never happen. 
Where are Toph and Katara? 
Forget about them, just keep an eye out for the King. 
I don't know what he looks like. 
You know, "royal", flowing robe, fancy jewelry. 
That could be anyone.
Another crab puff please.
You found us. 
I'd know your little footsteps anywhere Twinkletoes.
Thanks for letting us in.
Sorry, but the guy who escorted us in, won't let us out of his sight. 
What guy?
Not until we see the King.
Sorry! No, don't shout. 
You keep their attention while I look for the King. 
Watch this everybody!
Arrest them. They're Firebenders. 
This poor boy is confused. We're just simple refugees. 
It's true sir. We saw the whole thing. This crazy kid attacked the finest tea maker in the city. 
Oh ho ho. That's very sweet. 
You don't understand! They're Fire Nation! You have to believe me! 
Aang, the Earth King. 
Greetings your majesty. 
Hey, let me go.
Why won't you let us talk to the King? We have information that could defeat the Fire Nation!
This could be the most important thing he has ever heard.
So the King is just a figurehead.
He's your puppet!
But we found out about a solar eclipse that will leave the Fire Nation defenseless. You could lead an invasion...
You have to believe me, they're firebenders! They won't stop until they win the war. 
What are you talking about? Where do you think all the refugees come from? You can't hide it.
You can't keep the truth from all these people. They have to know.
I'll tell them. I'll make sure everyone knows!
What happened to Joo Dee?
Oh, I'm sure it is War Minister Qin. But just to be on the safe side...  Mai, and Ty Lee, take the earthbenders out!
Finally, something to do. 
Aang, what are you doing here? I thought you were looking for Appa?
I was, but something stopped me. Something big.
Now what's so big that Appa has to wait?
That. 
We made it to Ba Sing Se, and we're still not safe. No one is. 
I'm the Avatar. Take me to whoever's in charge. 
Not needed?
What about the Dragon of the West? He got in.
Yeah, thanks for the tour, but we still got the drill problem.
That's a good group name, very catchy.
Get a hold of yourself man!
Maybe you'd like the Avatar's help now? 
The question is, how are we gonna stop that thing?
Why are you all looking at me? 
You're the idea guy.
So I'm the only one who can ever come up with a plan? That's a lot of pressure. 
And also the complaining guy.
That part I don't mind. 
It's pronounced Moo-shee.
Uh, no no no.  But may I just say that you're like a flower in bloom, your beauty intoxicating. 
I'm gonna forget I saw that. 
I think Lee would make a good Freedom Fighter. He's just trying to find his way in the world, like us.  
I know he didn't get that scar from a waterbender. 
Besides, I thought we were going straight now? 
We are, and the new Freedom Fighters could use a guy like Lee. What do you think Longshot?
...
I can respect that. 
His Chi is blocked.  Who did this to you? 
Ty Lee. She doesn't look dangerous, but she knows the human body and it's weak points. It's like she takes you down from the inside. 
(an idea suddenly hits him and he begins gesturingwildly Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo! 
Yes? 
What you just said, that's how we're gonna take down the Drill. The same way Ty Lee took down all these big earthbenders. 
By hitting its pressure points!
We'll take it down from the inside. 
Once I whip up some cover, you're not gonna be able to see, so stay close to me. 
Run!
Everyone into the hole! 
It's so dark down here, I can't see a thing. 
Oh no, what a nightmare. 
Sorry.
There! 
Toph, Come on! 
No way am I going in that metal monster. I can't bend in there. I'll try to slow it down out here. 
Okay, good luck. 
I need a plan of this machine. Some schematics that show what the inside looks like. Then we can find it's weak points. 
Where are we gonna get something like that  What are you doing! Someone's gonna hear us! 
That's the point. I figure a machine this big needs engineers to run it, and when something breaks...
They come to fix it. 
Hi.
This'll work, thanks! 
It looks like the Drill is made up of two main structures. There's the inner mechanism, where we are now, and the outer shell.  The inner part and the outer part are connected by these braces. If we cut through them, the entire thing will collapse.
So, you guys got plans once you're inside the city? 
Oh! Jasmine, please.  Blaugh! Ugh. Coldest tea in Ba Sing Se is more like it. What a disgrace!
Hey, can I talk to you for a second? 
You and I have a much better chance of making it in the city if we stick together. You want to join the Freedom Fighters? 
Thanks, but I don't think you want me in your gang.
Come on, we made a great team looting that Captain's food. Think of all the good we could do for these refugees.
I said no.
Have it your way.
Hey!
What are you doing firebending your tea?! For a wise old man, that was a pretty stupid move.
I know you're not supposed to cry over spilled tea, but...   that's so sad. 
Wow, it looks a lot thicker in person than it does in the plans. We're going to have to work pretty hard to cut through that. 
What's this we stuff? Aang and I are going to have to do all the work.
Look, I'm the plan guy, You two  are the "cut stuff up with waterbending" guys.  Together, we're Team Avatar! 
C'mon team, don't quit now, we're... 
Grrrrrr! 
I mean,  you're almost there. 
At this rate, we won't do enough damage before the drill reaches the wall. 
I don't know how many more of those I have in me. 
Do you hear that We took it down. We better get out of here fast! 
C'mon brace, budge!
This is bad, really bad.
Were putting everything we've got into busting these braces, but it's taking too long!
Maybe we don't need to cut all the way through. Toph has been teaching me that you shouldn't give 100% of your energy into any one strike.  Sokka, take a fighting stance.You've gotta be quick and accurate.  Hit a series of points, and break your opponent's stance. And when he's reeling back, you deliver the final blow.  His own weight becomes his downfall. Literally. 
So we just need to weaken the braces, instead of cut all the way through.
Then I'll go to the top of this thing, and deliver the final blow. 
And boom, it all comes crashing down! 
Everyone inside that wall, the whole world, is counting on us. 
The whole world, minus the Fire Nation that is. 
C'mon twinkle toes, hurry up!
That's enough, we need to get to the next one!
Let's go ladies.
Good work Team Avatar. Now Aang just needs to...  DUCK! 
Whoa!
Hey. 
Guys get out of here, I know what I need to do. 
Wait! You need this water more than I do! 
Follow them, the Avatar is mine. 
Slurry pipeline What does that mean? 
It's rock and water mixed together, it means our way out. 
Ughh, disgusting!
She can shoot all the lightning she wants at me, I am not going in that wall sludge juice. 
Why don't you try blocking my chi now circus freak! 
Katara, keep that up. The pressure will build up in the drill, then when Aang delivers the final blow, it will be ready to pop!
This looks like a good spot Momo.  Aggh! 
General Sung, tell your soldiers to stop shooting rocks down here!
Good technique little sister! Keep it up! Don't forget to breathe!
You know, I am just about sick and tired of you telling me what to do all day. You're like a chattering Hog-Monkey!
Just bend the slurry woman!!
You guys need some help? 
Toph, help me plug up this drain!
What I'd give to be a metal bender. 
Momo, get out of here! 
Thanks Momo, I owe you one.
Now all I need is a...  Actually, that is what I needed for once. 
Here it comes! 
We lost. 
Last call for Ba Sing se!
Jet, relax! So the old guy had some hot tea. Big deal. 
He heated it himself!  Those guys are firebenders. 
What a handsome baby. 
Thank you. 
I just want to say, good effort out there today Team Avatar. 
Enough with the Team Avatar stuff. No matter how many times you say it, it's not gonna catch on. 
How about...  the "Boomerang Squad!", see it's good cause it's got "Aang" in it. (puts hand on Aang's head  Boomer-Aang.
I kinda like that one.
Let's talk about this on our way into the city. 
The "Aang Gang"?  
Sokka.
The "Fearsome Foursome"?
You're crazy.
Why? We're fearsome! 
Waterbending bomb! Yeah!
Sure, 5000 year old maps from the spirit library, just splash some water on 'em.
Sorry.
So, did you figure out what routewe're gonna take? 
Okay. We just got out of the desert, so we must be around here, and we need to go to Ba Sing Se, which is here. It looks like the only passage connecting the South to the North is this sliver of land called the Serpent's Pass. 
You're sure that's the best way to go? 
It's the only way, I mean it's not like we have Appa to fly us there.
Shush up about Appa. Can't you at least try to be sensitive? 
Katara, it's ok. I know I was upset about losing Appa before, but I just want to focus on getting to Ba Sing Se, and telling the Earth King about the solar eclipse.
Oh, well, ok. I'm glad you're doing better. 
Then to Ba Sing Se we go, no more distractions. 
Hello there fellow refugees! 
So, are you guys headed to Ba Sing Se too? 
Sure are, we're trying to get there before my wifeYing has her baby. 
Great, we can travel through the Serpent's Pass together. 
The Serpent's Pass?! Only the truly desperate take that deadly route. 
Deadly route.  Great pick, Sokka.
Well, we are desperate. 
You should come with us to Full Moon Bay. Ferries take refugees across the lake. It's the fastest way to Ba Sing Se. 
And it's hidden, so the Fire Nation can't find it. 
Hmmm, peaceful ferry ride...or deadly pass? 
I can't believe how many people's lives have been uprooted by the Fire Nation. 
We're all looking for a better life. Safe, behind the walls of Ba Sing Se. 
Who would have thought, after all these years, I'd return to the scene of my greatest military disgrace...as a tourist 
Look around, we're not tourists, we're refugees.  Ugh!  I'm sick of eating rotten food, sleeping in the dirt... I'm tired of living like this. 
Aren't we all?  My name's Jet, and these are my  freedom fighters, Smellerbee, and Longshot. 
Hey. 
Hello.
Here's the deal. I hear the Captain's eating like a king, while us refugees have to feed off his scraps. Doesn't seem fair, does it? 
What sort of "king" is he eating like? 
The fat, happy kind.  You want to help us "liberate" some food?
I'm in. 
I've told you already, no vegetables on the ferry!  One cabbage slug could destroy the entire ecosystem of Ba Sing Se. Security! 
Next!
Um, four tickets for the ferry to Ba Sing Se, please. 
Passport. 
Uh, no one told us we had to have passports.
Don't you know who this is? He's the Avatar! 
Ah, I see fifty Avatars a day, and by the way, not a very impressive costume. 
Besides, no animals allowed.  Do I need to call security?
That won't be necessary. 
Next!
I'll take care of this. My name is Toph Bei Fong, and I'll need 4 tickets. 
Oh! The Golden Seal of the Flying Boar, it is my pleasure to help anyone of the Bei Fong family.  
It is your pleasure. As you can see I am blind, and these three imbeciles are my valets. 
But the animal ...
Is my Seeing-Eye Lemur.  
Well, normally it's only 1 ticket per passport, but, this document is so official, I guess it's worth 4 tickets. 
Thank you very much. 
Alright, we scammed that lady good! 
Tickets and passports please. 
Is there a problem?
Yeah, I've got a problem with you. (pokes
Do I know you?
You mean you don't remember?  Maybe you remember this. 
Suki!!  
Sokka, it's good to see you!
You look so different without your makeup, and the new outfit. 
That crabby lady makes all the security guards wear them. And look at you sleeveless guy. Been working out? 
I'll grab a tree branch and do a few chin touches every now and then, nothing major. 
Are the other Kyoshi warriors around?
Yeah, after you left Kyoshi, we wanted to find a way to help people. We ended up escorting some refugees, and we've been here ever since.  Hi Momo, good to see you too.  So why are you guys getting tickets for the ferry? Wouldn't you just fly across on Appa? 
Appa is missing. We hope to find him in Ba Sing Se. 
I'm so sorry to hear that.  Are you doing okay? 
I'm doing fine. Would everybody stop worrying about me!
Avatar Aang, you have to help us! Someone took all of our belongings. Our passports, our tickets. Everything's gone! 
I'll talk to the lady for you. 
No passports, no tickets!! 
But she's pregnant, and all of their stuff was stolen. You have to make an exception.
No exceptions! If I just gave away tickets willy nilly to anyone, there would be no more order, and you know what that means. No more civilization!
What if we gave them our tickets? 
No!
But...
NEXT!!!
Don't worry, you'll get to the city safely. I'll lead you through the serpents pass. 
I can't believe we gave up our tickets, and now we're going through the Serpent's Pass. 
I can't believe you're still complaining about it. 
I'm coming too. 
Are you sure that's a good idea? 
Sokka, I thought you'd want me to come?
I do, it's just...
Just what? 
Nothing. I'm glad you're coming. 
This is the Serpent's Pass I thought it would be more windy, you know, like a serpent. Hmm, I guess they misnamed it. 
Look at this writing, how awful. 
What does it say? 
It says, "Abandon hope". 
How could we abandon hope? It's all we have. 
I don't know. The monks used to say that hope is just a distraction. So maybe we do need to abandon it. 
What are you talking about?
Hope isn't going to get us into Ba Sing Se, and it's not gonna find Appa. We need to focus on what we're doing right now, and that's getting across this pass. 
Ok, if you say so. 
The fire nation controls the western lake. Rumor has it they're working on something big on the other side, and they don't want anyone to find out what it is. 
I'm okay. 
They've spotted us! Let's go, let's go!
Suki, are you ok You have to be more careful!  C'mon!
Thanks for saving my life Toph. Hey no problem Sokka. 
Suki, you shouldn't sleep there.  Who knows how stable this ledge is? It could give way at any moment. 
Sokka, I'm fine. Stop worrying!
You're right, you're right. You're perfectly capable of taking care of yourself...Wait!  Oh, never mind. I thought I saw a spider, but you're fine.  
Guards coming!
You know, it's o.k. to miss Appa. What's going on with you? In the desert, all you cared about was finding Appa, and now it's like you don't care about him at all. 
You saw what I did out there. I was so angry about losing Appa, I couldn't control myself. I hated feeling like that. 
But now you're not letting yourself feel anything. I know sometimes it hurts more to hope, and it hurts more to care. But you have to promise me that you won't stop caring. C'mon, you need ahug. 
Thank you for your concern Katara. 
It's a beautiful moon. 
Yeah, it really is. 
Look, I know you're just trying to help, but I can take care of myself. 
I know you can. 
Then why are you acting so over protective?
It's so hard to lose someone you care about.  Something happened at the North Pole, and I couldn't protect someone. I don't want anything like that to ever happen again.
I lost someone I cared about. He didn't die, he just went away. I only had a few days to get to know him, but he was smart, and brave, and funny. 
Who is this guy? Is he taller than me? 
No, he's about your height. 
Is he better looking? 
It is you stupid!
Oh... 
I can't. 
I'm... sorry. 
No, you shouldn't be. 
So, Smellerbee, that's an unusual name for a young man. 
Maybe it's because I'm not a man. I'm a girl! 
Oh, now I see! It's a beautiful name for a lovely girl! 
I know. You're right. As long as I'm confident with who I am, it doesn't matter what other people think. Thanks Longshot. 
From what I heard, people eat like this every night in Ba Sing Se. I can't wait to set my eyes on that giant wall. 
It is a magnificent sight. 
So you've been there before?
Once, when I was a different man. 
I've done some things in my past that I'm not proud of. But that's why I'm going to Ba Sing Se, for a new beginning. A second chance.
That's very noble of you. I believe people can change their lives if they want to. I believe in second chances. 
Everyone single file.
Aang, I need help. 
What is that thing? 
I think I just figured out why they call it the Serpent's Pass. 
Suki, you know about giant sea monsters. Make it go away!
Just because I live near the Unagi doesn't mean I'm an expert! 
Oh great and powerful sea serpent, please accept this humble and tasty offering. Thank you. 
Sokka!
I'll distract him. Katara, get everyone across. 
Toph, come on. It's just ice. 
Actually, I'm gonna stay on my little island where I can see.   Ok, I'm coming! 
You're doing great! Just follow the sound of my voice! 
It's hard to ignore. 
You're almost there. 
Help! I can't swim! 
I'm coming Toph! 
Oh Sokka, you saved me. 
Actually, it's me.
Oh...well...heheh.  You can go ahead and let me drown now. 
There's the wall!  Now it's nothing but smooth sailing to Ba Sing Se.
Oh no! 
What's wrong? 
The baby's coming! (the refugee family ease Ying to the ground
What! Now! Can't you hold it in or something?
Sokka, Calm down. I helped Gran-Gran deliver lots of babies back home. 
This isn't the same as delivering an arctic seal! This is a real... human.... thing!
It's called a baby, and I helped todeliver plenty of those too.  Aang, get some rags. Sokka, water. Toph, I need you to make an earth tent. A big one.  Suki, come with me. 
You know, as soon as I saw your scar, I knew exactly who you were.  You're an outcast, like me. And us outcasts have to stick together. We have to watch each other's backs, because no one else will. 
I've realized lately, that being on your own isn't always the best path. 
You're doing great Ying.  Sokka! Where's that water? Get ready to push.  One, two, three...PUSH! 
It's a girl!
So, you want to go see the baby? Or are you going to  faint like an old lady again? 
No no, I'm good this time. 
Aang, you have to come see this. 
She sounds healthy. 
She's beautiful.
It's so...squishy looking. 
What should we name her?
I want our daughter's name to be unique.  I want it to mean something. 
I've been going through a really hard time lately. But you've made me... hopeful again.
I know what I want to name our baby now. Hope.
That's a perfect name. Hope.
I thought I was trying to be strong, but really I was just running away from my feelings. Seeing this family together, so full of happiness and love, it reminded me of how I feel about Appa.....and how I feel about you.
I promise I'll find Appa as fast as I can. I just really need to do this. 
See ya in the big city.
Say hi to that big fuzzball for me. 
You'll find him Aang. 
I know. Thank you Katara. 
You ready Momo? 
Sokka, It's been really great to see you again. 
Whoa, hold on. Why does it sound like you're saying goodbye?
I came along because I wanted to make sure you got through the Serpent's Pass safely. But now I need to get back to the other Kyoshi warriors. 
So you came along to protect me? 
Listen, I'm really sorry about last night.  We were talking, and saying things,  I just got carried away and before I knew it I... 
You talk too much.
Sorry Momo, Appa's gonna have to wait.
Suddenly, they heard something down the hall, in the dark. Oooh... It came into the torchlight. And they knew the blade of Wing - Fun was haunted! Aah-ah...
I think I liked "the man with a sword for a hand" better.
Water Tribe slumber parties must stink.
No, wait, I've got one, and this is a true Southern Water Tribe story.
Is this one of those "a friend of my cousin knew some guy that this happened to" stories?
No, it happened to Mom.  One winter, when Mom was a girl, a snowstorm buried the whole village for weeks. A month later, Mom realized she hadn't seen her friend Nini since the storm. So mom and some others went to check on Nini's family. When they got there, no one was home, just a fire flickering in the fireplace. While the men went out to search, Mom stayed in the house. When she was alone, she heard a voice,  "It's so cold and I can't get warm." Mom turned and saw Nini standing by the fire. She was blue, like she was frozen. Mom ran outside for help, but... when every one came back, Nini was gone.
Where'd she go? 
No one knows. Nini's house stands empty to this day. But sometimes, people see smoke coming up from the chimney, like little Nini is still trying to get warm.
Wait. Guys, did you hear that? I hear people under the mountain, and they're screaming.
Pft, nice try.
No, I'm serious, I hear something.
You're probably just jumpy from the ghost stories.
It just stopped.
All right, now I'm getting scared.
Yes, please.
Thanks for letting us stay here tonight. You have a lovely inn.
Aren't you sweet? You know, you should be careful. People have been disappearing in those woods you were camping in.
What do you mean, disappearing?
When the moon turns full, people walk in, and they don't come out.  Who wants more tea?  Don't worry; you'll all be completely safe here. Why don't I show you to your rooms, and you can get a good night's rest?
I know Momo, this place is creepy. I don't know if I'm gonna be able to fall asleep.
Wakey-wakey.  Time to go shopping.
That Mr. Yao seems to have a thing for you. Maybe we should go back and see if he'll give us some free komodo sausages.
You would have me use my feminine charms to take advantage of that poor man? I think you and I are going to get along swimmingly.
You won't have any ash bananas till next week?
Well, I have to send the boy to Hing-Wa Island to get them, and it's a two-day trip.
Oh, right, tomorrow's the full moon.
Exactly, I can't lose another delivery boy in the woods.
People disappearing in the woods, weird stuff during full moons... this just reeks of spirit world shenanigans.
I bet if we take a little walk around town, we'll find out what these people did to the environment to make the spirits mad.
And then you can sew up this little mystery, lickety-split, Avatar-style.
Helping people...that's what I do.
Why don't you all take those things back to the inn? I just have to run a couple more errands. I'll be back in a little while.
This is a mysterious little town you have here .
Mysterious town for mysterious children.
That Hama seems a little strange. Like she knows something, or she's hiding something.
That's ridiculous. She's a nice woman who took us in and gave us a place to stay. She kind of reminds me of Gran-Gran.
But what did she mean by that comment, "mysterious children"?
Gee, I don't know. Maybe because she found four strange kids, camping in the woods at night? Isn't that a little mysterious?
I'm gonna take a look around.
Sokka! Sokka, what are you doing? You can't just snoop around someone's house.
It'll be fine.
Sokka, you're gonna get us all in trouble, and this is just plain rude.
I'm not finished yet. [grunts] Come on...
Ok, that's pretty creepy.
So... she's got a hobby. There's nothing weird about that. Sokka, you've looked enough. Hama will be back soon.
Just an ordinary, puppet-loving innkeeper, huh? Then why does she have a locked door up here?
Probably to keep people like you from snooping through her stuff.
We'll see.  It's empty except for a little chest.
Maybe it's treasure.
Sokka, what are you doing? You're breaking into a private room.
I have to see what's in there.
We shouldn't be doing this.
Maybe there's a key here somewhere.
Oh, hand it over. 
Come on, come on!
This isn't as easy it looks.
Guys, I don't know about this.
This is crazy, I'm leaving.
Suit yourself. Do it, Toph.
I'll tell you what's in the box.
An old comb?
It's my greatest treasure. It's the last thing I owned from growing up in the Southern Water Tribe.
You're from the Southern Water Tribe?
Just like you.
How did you know?
I heard you talking around your campfire.
But why didn't you tell us?
I wanted to surprise you. I bought all this food today so I could fix you a big, Water Tribe dinner. Of course, I can't get all the ingredients I need here, but ocean kumquats are a lot like sea prunes, if you stew them long enough.
Great.
I knew I felt a bond with you right away.
And I knew you were keeping a secret, so I guess we're both right.  But I'm sorry we were sneaking around.
Apology accepted. Now let's get cooking.
I'd steer clear of the "sea prunes".
I thought they were ocean kumquats.
Close enough.
Who wants five-flavor soup?
You're a Waterbender! I've never met another Waterbender from our tribe.
That's because the Fire Nation wiped them all out. I was the last one.
So how did you end up out here?
I was stolen from my home.  It was over 60 years ago when the raids started. 
They came again and again, each time, rounding up more of our Waterbenders, and taking them captive. 
Finally, I too was captured.
I was led away in chains. The last Waterbender of the Southern Water Tribe. 
They put us in terrible prisons here in the Fire Nation. I was the only one who managed to escape.
How did you get away? And why did you stay in the Fire Nation?
I'm sorry. It's too painful to talk about anymore.
We completely understand. We lost our mother in a raid.
Oh, you poor things.
I can't tell you what it means to meet you. It's an honor, you're a hero.
I never thought I'd meet another Southern Waterbender. I'd like to teach you what I know, so you can carry on the Southern Tradition when I'm gone.
Yes, yes of course! To learn about my heritage, it would mean everything to me.
Growing up at the South Pole, Waterbenders are totally at home surrounded by snow and ice and seas.  But, as you probably noticed on your travels, that isn't the case wherever you go.
I know, when we were stranded in the desert, I felt like there was almost nothing I could do.
That's why you have to learn to control water wherever it exists.
I've even used my own sweat for waterbending.
That's very resourceful, Katara. You're thinking like a true master. But did you know you can even pull water out of thin air? (throws her hand out and creates a circle over her head, collecting the moisture in the
This has gotta be the nicest, natural setting in the Fire Nation. I don't see anything that would make a spirit mad around here.
Maybe the moon spirit just turned mean.
The moon spirit is a gentle, loving lady. She rules the sky with compassion and... lunar goodness.
Excuse me, sir. Can you tell us anything about the spirit that's been stealing people?
Where does Old Man Ding live?
Wow, these flowers are beautiful.
They're called Fire Lilies. They only bloom a few weeks a year, but they're one of my favorite things about living here. And like all plants, and all living things, they're filled with water.
I met a Waterbender who lived in a swamp, and could control the vines by bending the water inside.
You can take it even further.
That was incredible.  It's a shame about the lilies, though.
They're just flowers. When you're a Waterbender in a strange land, you do what you must to survive. Tonight, I'll teach you the ultimate technique of Waterbending. It can only be done during the full moon, when your bending is at its peak.
But isn't that dangerous? I thought people have been disappearing around here during the full moon.
Oh, Katara. Two master Waterbenders beneath a full moon? I don't think we have anything to worry about.
Old Man Ding?
We wanted to ask you about that. 
Did you get a good look at the spirit that took you?
Why would a spirit want to take people to a mountain?
Oh, no!  I did hear people screaming under the mountain. The missing villagers must still be there.
I can hear them, they're this way.
Can you feel the power the full moon brings?  For generations, it has blessed Waterbenders with its glow, allowing us to do incredible things.  I've never felt more alive.
This is the place.
I can't see anything down there.
That's why you have me, let's go.
I didn't know that spirits made prisons like this, who brought you here?
A witch, what do you mean?
Hama!
I knew there was something creepy about her. 
We have to stop Hama!
I'll get these people out of here, you go.
What I'm about to show you, I discovered in that wretched, Fire Nation prison.   The guards were always careful to keep any water away from us. They piped in dry air, and had us suspended away from the ground. 
Before giving us any water, they would bind our hands and feet so we couldn't bend. Any sign of trouble was met with cruel retribution. 
And yet, each month, I felt the full moon enriching me with its energy. There had to be something I could do to escape.  Then I realized that where there is life, there is water. The rats that scurried across the floor of my cage, were nothing more than skins filled with liquid.  And I passed years developing the skills that would lead to my escape.  Bloodbending. Controlling the water in another body.  Enforcing your own will over theirs.  Once I had mastered the rats, I was ready for the men...
And during the next full moon, I walked free for the first time in decades.   My cell unlocked by the very guards assigned to keep me in.  Once you perfect this technique, you can control anything... or anyone.
But, to reach inside someone and control them? I don't know if I want that kind of power.
The choice is not yours. The power exists...and it's your duty to use the gifts you've been given to win this war. Katara, they tried to wipe us out, our entire culture... your mother!
I know.
Then you should understand what I'm talking about. We're the last Waterbenders of the Southern Tribe. We have to fight these people whenever we can. Wherever they are, with any means necessary!
It's you. You're the one who's making people disappear during the full moons.
They threw me in prison to rot, along with my brothers and sisters. They deserve the same. You must carry on my work.
I won't! I won't use bloodbending, and I won't allow you to keep terrorizing this town.
You should have learned the technique before you turned against me.  It's impossible to fight your way out of my grip. I control every muscle, every vein in your body.
Stop...please.
You're not the only one who draws power from the moon. My bending is more powerful than yours, Hama. Your technique is useless on me!
We know what you've been doing, Hama!
Give up, you're outnumbered.
No. You've outnumbered yourselves.
Katara, look out! It's like my brain has a mind of its own. Stop it, arm, stop it!
This feels weird.
I'm sorry, Aang.
It's ok.
Don't hurt your friends, Katara... and don't let them hurt each other.
No!
My work is done.  Congratulations, Katara. You're a bloodbender.
How could you let them take Appa  Why didn't you stop them?!
I couldn't! The library was sinking! You guys were still inside and -
You could have come to get us! I could have saved him!
I can hardly feel any vibrations out here. The sandbenders snuck upon me and there wasn't time for -
You just didn't care! You never liked Appa! You wanted him gone!
Aang, stop it. You know Toph did all she could. She saved our lives.
Who's going to save our lives now? We'll never make it out of here.
That's all any of you guys care about: yourselves! You don't care whether Appa is okay or not! 
We're all concerned, but we can't afford to be fighting now.
I'm going after Appa.
Aang, wait!
We'd better start walking. We're the only people who know about the solar eclipse. We have to get that information to Ba-Sing-Se.
You think if we dig out the giant owl, he'll give us a ride?
Maybe we should make camp.
No, please, don't stop for me! 
What now?
Colonel Mongke! What a pleasant surprise!
If you're surprised we're here then the Dragon of the West has lost a few steps.
You know these guys? 
Sure. Colonel Mongke and the Rough Riders are legendary. Each one is a different kind of weapons specialist.  They are also a very capable singing group.
We're not here to give a concert. We're here to apprehend fugitives!
Would you like some tea first? I'd love some. How about you, Kachi?  I make you as a jasmine man. Am I right? 
Enough stalling! Round 'em up!
It's nice to see old friends.
Too bad you don't have any old friends that don't want to attack you.
Hmm... Old friends that don't want to attack me...
Can't you watch where you're -
No.
Right. Sorry.
Come on guys, we've got to stick together.
If I sweat any more, I don't think sticking together will be a problem.
Katara, can I have some water?
Okay, but we've got to try to conserve it.
We're drinking your bending water? You used this on the swamp guy!
It does taste swampy.
I'm sorry, it's all we have.
Not anymore! Look!
Sokka, wait! You shouldn't be eating strange plants! 
There's water trapped inside these! 
I don't know...
Suit yourself. It's very thirst-quenching, though.
Drink cactus juice. It'll quench ya! Nothing's quenchier.  It's the quenchiest!
Okay, I think you've had enough. 
Who lit Toph on fire?
Can I get some of that cactus?
I don't think that's a good idea. Come on, we need to find Aang.
How did we get out here in the middle of the ocean?
Uhhh...
Appa! Appa! No... NO!
What is that? 
What? What is what?
It's a giant mushroom! Maybe it's friendly!
Let's just keep moving. I hope Aang's okay...
Friendly mushroom!Mushy giant friend!
Yeah, a little barefoot blind girl and her friends passed through here a few days ago.
Maybe you could give me a little incentive? 
They went in the desert! Too bad there's almost no chance they survived.
I'm sorry, Aang. I know it's hard for you right now, but we need to focus on getting out of here.
What's the difference? We won't survive without Appa. We all know it.
Come on, Aang! We can do this if we work together. Right, Toph? 
As far as I can feel, we're trapped in a giant bowl of sand pudding. I got nothin'.
Sokka?  Any ideas how to find Ba-Sing-Se? 
Why don't we ask the circle birds? 
Ugh... We're getting out of this desert, and we're going to do it together! Aang, get up. Everybody hold hands. We can do this. We have to.
I think we should stop for the night.
Is there any more water? 
This is the last of it. Everyone can have a little drink.
Momo, no! You've killed us all!
No, he hasn't.
Oh, right. Bending.
Sokka, let me see the things you got from the library.
What! I didn't steal anything! Who told you that?!  It was you! You ratted me out!
Sokka, I was there. 
It doesn't matter. None of those will tell us where Appa is.
No, but we can find out which way Ba-Sing-Se is. We can use the stars to guide us. That way we can travel at night when it's cool and rest during the day.  Just try to get some sleep. We'll start again in a few hours.
No one here is going to help us. These people just look like filthy wanderers.
So do we.  Ah, this is interesting. I think I've found our friend.
You brought us here to gamble on Pai Sho? 
May I have this game? 
Those who do can always find a friend.
What are you old gasbags talking about? 
I always tried to tell you that Pai Sho is more than just a game.
I thought you said he would help!
He is. Just watch.
Come on, get up. We need to go.
Yesterday my mouth tasted like mud. Now it just tastes like sand. I never thought I'd miss the taste of mud so much.
I'm awake. I couldn't sleep.
Well, we need to get moving if we want to get out of this sand pit.
Appa!
Appa? But why would Princess Yue need him? She's the moon! She flies by herself!
It's just a cloud. Wait! A cloud! (To Aang Here, fly up and bend the water from that cloud into my pouch.
Wow... there's hardly any in here.
I'm sorry, okay! It's a desert cloud; I did all I could! What's anyone else doing! What are you doing?
Trying to keep everyone together. Let's just get moving. We need to head in this direction.
Ow! Crud! I am so sick of not feeling where I'm going! And what idiot buried a boat in the middle of the desert?! 
A boat? 
Believe me, I kicked it hard enough to feel plenty of vibrations.
It's one of the gliders the sandbenders use! And look! It's got some kind of compass on it! I bet it can point us out of here! Aang, you can bend a breeze so we can sail it. We're going to make it!
Now that you played Pai Sho,are you going to do some flower arranging, or is this club going to offer some real help?
You must forgive my nephew. He is not an initiate and has little appreciation for the cryptic arts.
Who knocks at the guarded gate? 
One who has eaten the fruit and tasted its mysteries. 
I'm afraid it's members only. Wait out here.
The needle on this compass doesn't seem to be pointing north according to my charts.
Take it easy little lady. I'm sure the sand folks who built this baby know how to get around here.
That's what the compass is pointing to! That giant rock! It must be the magnetic center of the desert.
A rock?  Yes! Let's go!
Maybe we can find some water there!
Maybe we can find some sandbenders.
Ahhh... Finally! Solid ground!
I think my head is starting to clear out the cactus juice. And look! 
This tastes like rotten penguin meat! Awww I feel woozy.
You've been hallucinating on cactus juice all day and then you just lick something you find stuck to the wall of a cave?! 
I have a natural curiosity.
I don't think this is a normal cave. This was carved by something.
Yeah... look at the shape.
There's something buzzing in here. Something that's coming for us!
What are you doing?! That rock almost crushed me!
Sorry, I can't tell where they are in the air! 
I got this one.
Sokka, there's nothing there.
I guess my head's not as clear as I thought.
We have to get out of here! I'm completely out of water to bend!
Momo! I'm not losing anyone else out here.
Come on, we're going down. 
Yeah! You got it! She got it, right? 
Yes. Now let's move.
On your left!
What's going on? Is the club meeting over? 
Everything is taken care of. We're heading to Ba-Sing-Se.
Ba-Sing-Se? Why would we go to the Earth Kingdom capital? 
We can hide in plain sight there. And it's the safest place in the world from the Fire Nation. Even I couldn't break through to the city.
We found the sailer abandoned in the desert. We're traveling with the Avatar. Our bison was stolen and we have to get to Ba-Sing-Se.
Sorry, father.
I recognize the son's voice. He's the one that stole Appa.
Are you sure?
I never forget a voice.
You stole Appa! Where is he  What did you do to him 
They're lying! They're the thieves!
Where is my bison?! 
As you can see, no one is here but us.
Hey! That room is for flowers only!
You tell me where he is now!
I-It wasn't me!
You said to put a muzzle on him!
You muzzled Appa?!
I'm sorry! I didn't know that it belonged to the Avatar!
Tell me where Appa is!
I traded him! To some merchants! He's probably in Ba-Sing-Se by now! They were going to sell him there! Please! We'll escort you out of the desert! We'll help however we can!
Just get out of here! Run!
Doing nothing is a waste of time.  We're being sent away on a forced vacation.  I feel like a child.
Lighten up. So dad wants to meet with his advisors alone... without anyone else around. Don't take it personally.
We used to come every summer when we were kids.
That was a long time ago.
It smells like old lady in here.
Gee, I wonder why.
Are you serious? It looks like the beach threw up all over it.
We know you're upset that you were forced to come here this weekend. But Ember Island is a magical place.  Keep an open mind.  
Give it a chance...
Aang, I know swimming is fun and all,  but do you really think you should be exposing yourself like that   Cover up!
What? I'm wearing trunks.
I know...it's your tattoos  I'm worried about. What if someone sees you?
There are walls all around us. It's completely safe.
Whoo, hey! 
Let's go again! 
Here...  This is for you.
Why would I want that?
I saw it and I thought it was pretty. Don't girls like stuff like this?
Maybe stupid girls.
Forget it!
I thought since it's so hot... Here. 
Thanks. This is really refreshing.
Hey, beach bums, we're playing next.  Ty Lee, get over here now! 
See that girl with the silly pigtails?  When she runs towards the ball, there's just the slightest hesitation of her left foot. I'm willing to bet a childhood
Yes, we defeated you for all time! You will never rise from the ashes of your shame and humiliation!  Well, that was fun.
I'm having a party tonight.  You should come by.
What about me and my brother?  Aren't you going to invite us?  You don't know who we are, do you?
Don't you know who we are? We're Chan and Ruon Jian. 
But fine, you're invited. Just so you know though, some of the most important teenagers in the Fire Nation are gonna be at this party so...try and act normal.
We'll do our best.
Why didn't you tell those guys who we were?
I guess I was intrigued.  I'm so used to people worshipping us.
Yes, I know, and I love it! But for once, I just wanted to see how people would treat us if they didn't know who we were. 
Um... You're a little early. No one's here yet.
I heard you telling someone you'd be partying from dusk till dawn.  It's dusk so we're here.
But that's just an expression. 
We are the perfect party guests. We arrive right on time because we are very punctual. 
All right, listen, My dad's an admiral. He has no idea I'm having this party,  so don't mess anything up.
That's a sharp outfit, Chan...careful,  you could puncture the hull of an Empire-Class Fire Nation Battleship, leaving thousands to drown at sea...  because it's so sharp.
Um...  Thanks.
Pft. He thinks he's so great.  Well, what do you think of him? 
I don't have any opinion about him. I hardly know him.
You like him, don't you? 
Yeah. Tell us.
Those boys only like you because you make it so easy for them. You're not a challenge. You're a tease. It's not like they actually care who you are.  Ok, ok, calm down. I didn't mean what I said.  Look, maybe I just said it because I was a little...  jealous.
Well, you're right about all
Well, that sounds really shallow and stupid.  Let's try it.

I'm bored.
I know.
I'm hungry. 
So what?
So, find me some food.
Sure. 
Chan, I'm ready for a tour of the house.
Is this your first time on Ember Island? 
No, I used to come here years ago.
It's a great place if you like sand.  Yeah, it's like,  "Welcome to Sandy Land." )
Your arms look so strong.
Yeah, I know.  You're pretty.
Together, you and I will (camera rotates right as Azula quickly
Uh... I gotta go. 
Hey, watch it! That food was for my cranky girlfriend. 
Stop talking to my girlfriend!
Zuko, what is wrong with you?!
What's wrong with me?!
Your temper's out of control. You blow up over every little thing. You're so impatient and hot-headed and angry.
Well, at least I feel something...as opposed to you. You have no passion for anything.  You're just a big "blah".
It's over, Zuko. We're done.
Who broke my Nana's vase?  That's it, you're out of here.
I was just leaving.
Nice.
Guys, you're all gonna think I'm crazy, but it feels like a metal man is coming.
I thought I'd find you here.
Those summers we spent here seem so long ago. So much has changed.
Come down to the beach with me.  Come on, this place is depressing.
Hey... 
Where's your new boyfriend?  Are you cold? 
I'll make a fire.  There's plenty of stuff to burn in there.
This is crazy! How can we beat a guy who blows things up with his mind?
We can. Jump on Appa. I'll try to
I'm ok. 
Well, that was random.
I don't think so. I get the feeling he knows who we are. 
What does it look like I'm doing? 
You think I care?
You don't know me, so why don't you just mind your own business! 
No, you don't.  You're stuck in your little Ty Lee world, where everything's great all the time.
Zuko, leave her alone.
'I'm so pretty, look at me. I can walk on my hands, whoo!'  Circus freak!

Here we go.
Guess that explains why you need 10 boyfriends, too.
Attention issues. You couldn't get enough attention when you were a kid, so   you're trying to make up for it now.
I don't believe in auras.
Yeah, you don't believe in anything.
Oh, well, I'm sorry I can't be as high-strung and crazy as the rest of you.
I'm sorry, too. I wish you would be high-strung and crazy for once,  instead of keeping all your feelings bottled up inside. She just called your aura dingy. Are you gonna take that?
What do you want from me? You want a teary confession about how hard my childhood was? Well, it wasn't.  I was a rich only child who got anything I wanted. As long as I behaved... and sat still...and didn't speak unless spoken to.  My mother said I had to keep out of trouble. (Cut to wide shot of the four of them around
Well, that's it, then.  You had a controlling mother who had certain expectations, and if you strayed from them you were shut down. That's why you're afraid to care about anything, and why you can't express yourself.
You want me to express myself?  Leave me alone!
I like it when you express yourself. 
Don't touch me. I'm still mad at you.
My life hasn't been that easy, either, Mai. 
Whatever- that doesn't excuse the way you've been acting.
Bad skin?  Normal teenagers worry about bad skin. I don't have that luxury. My father decided to teach me a permanent lesson on my face. 
For so long, I thought that if my dad accepted me, I'd be happy. I'm back home, now my dad talks to me. Huh, he even thinks I'm a hero.  Everything should be perfect, right  I should be happy now, but I'm not. I'm angrier than ever and I don't know why.
There's a simple question you need to answer then. (she
No one,  I'm just angry.
Yeah, who are you angry at, Zuko?
Everyone...  I don't know.
Is it Dad? 
No, no!
Me?
No, no... No, no.
Then who? Who are you angry at?
Answer the question, Zuko.
Come on, answer the question.
Come on, answer it.
I'm angry at myself! 
Why? 
Because I'm confused. Because I'm not sure I know the difference between right and wrong anymore.
You're pathetic.
I know one thing I care about...  I care about you. 
Well, those were wonderful performances, everyone.
I guess you wouldn't understand,  would you, Azula  Because you're just so perfect.
Well, yes, I guess you're right. I don't have sob stories like all of you. I could sit here and complain how our mom liked Zuko more than me, but I don't really care.  My own mother... thought I was a monster.  She was right, of course, but it still hurt.
You know what would make this trip
We've got some bad news, Chan. 
Party's over.
Today's the day! Can you believe it? After all that time searching for a teacher, I'm finally starting earthbending! And this place... i-it's perfect! Don't you think, Sokka?
Oh, you're still sleeping, huh?
Sorry!
Good morning, earthbending student!
Good morning, sifu Toph.
Hey... you never call me sifu Katara.
Well, if you think I should...
Sorry, snoozles. We'll do our earthbending as quietly as we can.
So what move are you going to teach me first? Rockalanche?  The trembler?  Oh! Maybe I can learn to make a whirlpool out of land!
Let's start with "move a rock".
Sounds good! Sounds good!
The key to earthbending is your stance.  You've got to be steady and strong. Rock is a stubborn element.  If you're going to move it, you've got to be like a rock yourself. 
Like a rock. Got it.
Good. Now the actual motion of this one is pretty simple.  Okay, you ready to give it a try?
I'm ready.
Rock beats airbender!
My beloved Lu Ten, I will see you again.
Uncle!
You were unconscious. Azula did this to you. 
It was a surprise attack.
Somehow, that's not so surprising.
I hope I made it the way you like it.
Mmm, good.  That was very, uhh... bracing!
So uncle, I've been thinking. It's only a matter of time before I run into Azula again. I'm going to need to know more advanced firebending if I want to stand a chance against her. I know what you're going to say: she's my sister and I should be trying to get along with her.
No, she's crazy and she needs to go down.  It's time to resume your training.
I don't understand what went wrong.  He did it exactly the way you did.
Maybe there's another way.  What if I came at the boulder from a different angle?
No, that's the problem. You've got to stop thinking like an airbender.  There's no different angle, no clever solution, no trickity trick that's going to move that rock.  You've got to face it head on. And when I say head on, I mean like this!
Whoa!
I've been training Aang for a while now. He really responds well to a positive teaching experience. Lots of encouragement and praise. Kind words. If he's doing something wrong, maybe a gentle nudge in the right direction. 
Thanks, Katara. A gentle nudge. I'll try that.  Keep your knees high, twinkletoes!
Rocklike!
Rocklike!
You're awfully cute, but unfortunately for you, you're made of meat. Just a bit closer...
Gotcha!  You are a lucky little meat creature.
Lightning is a pure expression of firebending, without aggression. It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is. Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire.  It is precise and deadly, like Azula. To perform the technique requires peace of mind.
I see. That's why we're drinking tea: To calm the mind.
Oh yeah, good point! I mean, yes.
There is energy all around us.  The energy is both yin and yang; positive energy and negative energy.  Only a select few firebenders can separate these energies. This creates an imbalance. The energy wants to restore balance and in a moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together.  You provide release and guidance, creating lightning.
I'm ready to try it! 
Remember, once you separate the energy, you do not command it. You are simply its humble guide. Breathe first.
This time we're going to try something a little different. Instead of moving a rock, you're going to stop a rock.  Get in your horse stance!  I'm going to roll that boulder down at you.  If you have the attitude of an earthbender, you'll stay in your stance and stop the rock.  Like this.
Sorry, Toph, but are you sure this is really the best way to teach Aang earthbending?
I'm glad you said something.  Actually, there is a better way.  This way he'll really have to sense the vibrations of the boulder to stop it. Thank you, Katara!
Yeah, thanks Katara!
Heh.
I guess I just panicked. I don't know what to say.
There's nothing to say. You blew it. You had a perfect stance and perfect form but when it came right down to it you didn't have the guts. 
I know. I'm sorry.
Yeah, you are sorry. If you're not tough enough to stop the rock, then you could at least give it the pleasure of smushing you instead of jumping out of the way like a jelly-boned wimp! Now, do you have what it takes to face that rock like an earthbender?! 
No. I don't think I do.
Aang, it's no big deal. You'll take a break and try earthbending again when you're ready. Besides, you still have a lot of waterbending to work on, okay?
Yeah... that sounds good.
Yeah, whatever, go splash around until you feel better. 
Why can't I do it? Instead of lightning, it keeps exploding in my face! Like everything always does!
I was afraid this might happen. You will not be able to master lightning until you have dealt with the turmoil inside you.
What turmoil?
Zuko, you must let go of your feelings of shame if you want your anger to go away.
But I don't feel any shame at all! I'm as proud as ever!
Prince Zuko, pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source. True humility is the only antidote to shame.
Well... my life has been nothing but humbling lately. 
I have another idea. I will teach you a firebending move that even Azula doesn't know, because I made it up myself!
You probably think I deserve this, don't you?  Look, I'm sorry I hunted you, but that's just the natural order of things! Big things eat smaller things, nothing personal. But this time it didn't work out that way.
I admit it. You're cute.  Okay, you've convinced me. If I get out of this alive, it's a comically correct vegetarian existence for me. No meat. Even though meat is so tasty.
Hey, it looks like my karma is already paying off!
That's okay! I got it!
Now come back, boomerang. 
You know this block you're having is only temporary, right?
I don't want to talk about it.
You do know that's the problem, don't you? If you face this issue instead of avoiding it...
I know I know I know I know, I get it, alright!  I need to face it head-on, like a rock. But I just can't do it! I don't know why I can't, but I can't.
Aang, if fire and water are opposites, then what's the opposite of air?
I guess it's earth.
That's why it's so hard for you to get this.  You're working with your natural opposite. But you'll figure it out.  I know you will.  Think fast!
Excellent. You have the reflexes of a waterbending master.
Thanks, Katara. Sifu Katara.
Fire is the element of power. The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will, and the energy and drive to achieve what they want. Earth is the element of substance. The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong. They are persistent and enduring. Air is the element of freedom. The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom. Also, they apparently had pretty good senses of humor!  Water is the element of change. The people of the Water Tribe are capable of adapting to many things. They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything.
Why are you telling me these things?
It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. If we take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale.  Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations will help you become whole.
All this four elements talk is sounding like Avatar stuff.
It is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the Avatar so powerful. But, it can make you more powerful too.  You see, the technique I am about to teach you is one I learned by studying the waterbenders.
Aang! I found these nuts in your bag.  I figured you wouldn't mind. And besides, even if you did, you're too much of a pushover to do anything about it.
As a matter of fact, I don't mind. I'm happy to share anything I have.
You know, I'm really glad you feel that way, because I also have this great new nutcracker.
Actually, I'd prefer if you didn't...  That's an antique, hand crafted by the monks...  It's a delicate instrument!
It's not the only delicate instrument around here.
Ohmmmm...
Hey Aang, have you seen...
Meditating here!
It's important. It's almost sundown and Sokka isn't back yet. I think we should search for him.
We'll find him faster if we split up.
Okay, karma person or thing, whoever's in charge of this stuff, if I can just get out of this situation alive, I will give up meat and sarcasm. Okay? OW!  That's all I got! It's pretty much my whole identity! Sokka, the meat and sarcasm guy!  But I'm willing to be Sokka the veggies and straight talk fellow! ...Deal?
Aang! Thank goodness! Have you got any meat?
Sokka! Are you okay?
Stop, stop! You're going to pull my fingers off and I don't think the rest of me is coming! 
Hmm... I bet I can airbend you out of here.
Seriously, Aang, I know you're new at it, but I could use a little earthbending here. How about it?
I can't. I can't do it.
If you can't earthbend me out of here, go get Toph.
I can't do that either.
You can't? Why not?
It would just be really... uncomfortable.
Uncomfortable?  Well, I wouldn't want to make you feel uncomfortable.
Thanks, Sokka.  This whole earthbending thing really has me confused. There's so much pressure. Everyone expects me to get it right away. It puts me in a really awkward position.
Awkward position... I think I know the feeling.
If I try, I fail. But if I don't try, I'm never going to get it. I feel like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place.
Hmm. How about that.  Aang, this is my friend Foo Foo Cuddlypoops. Foo Foo Cuddlypoops, Aang.
Aww, what a cute name for a little baby sabertooth mooselion cub. 
Really? He looks nothing like a sabertooth mooselion.
It's hard to tell before their giant teeth and horns grow in. Whatcha doin' out here, little guy? Did you lose your mama?
Waterbenders deal with the flow of energy. A waterbender lets their defense become their offense, turning their opponents' energy against them. I learned a way to do this with lightning.
You can teach me to redirect lightning?
If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it.  You must create a pathway from your fingertips up your arm to your shoulder and down into your stomach.  The stomach is the source of energy in your body. It is called the sea of chi. Only in my case, it is more like a vast ocean.  You direct it up again and out the other arm.  The stomach detour is critical. You must not let the lightning pass through your heart  or the damage could be deadly. You may wish to try a physical motion to get a feel for the pathway's flow. Like this.  Now, are you focusing your energy Can you feel your own chi flowing in, down, up, and out?
I think so. 
Come on. You've got to feel the flow.
Excellent! You've got it!
Great! I'm ready to try it with real lightning!
What, are you crazy? Lightning is very dangerous.
I thought that was the point:  you teaching me how to protect myself from it.
But I'm not going to shoot lightning at you!  If you are lucky, you will never have to use this technique at all.
Well, if you won't help me, I'll find my own lightning.
Hey, there... we found your cub!  See? We have no problem with you! We're friendly. 
Aang, this is bad! You gotta get me outta here! 
This is really bad!  Please, Aang! You have to earthbend me out, there's no other way!
Oh no!  Whoo-hoo! Look at me!
Please don't leave me again.
I won't.
What are you doing here?
Just enjoying the show.
What? You were there the whole time? 
Pretty much.
Why didn't you do something? Sokka was in trouble! I was in trouble! You could've gotten him out and helped us get away!
I guess it just didn't occur to me.
Enough! I want my staff back!
Do it now.
What?
Earthbend, twinkletoes. You just stood your ground against a crazy beast, and even more impressive, you stood your ground against me. You've got the stuff.
But...
DO IT!
You did it! You're an earthbender.
I can't believe it! 
Aww, this is really a wonderful, touching moment. So, could you get me out of her so I can give you both a big, snuggly hug?
No problem, Sokka!
Actually, you should probably let me do that. You're still a little new to this. You might accidentally crush him.
Yeah, no crushing, please.
You found him! 
The whole time that I was in that hole, not knowing if I would live or die, it makes a man think about what's really important. I realized...
Hey, Katara, look what I can do!
You did it! I knew you would!  You tried the positive reinforcement, didn't you?
Yep. It worked wonders.
Appa! Appa! I can earthbend now! The key is being completely rooted! Physically and mentally unmovable! 
You've always thrown everything you could at me! Well, I can take it! And now I can give it back!  Come on! Strike me! You've never held back before! 
What's out here? 
A lot actually. There's hundreds of little-
Shhh! I know you can see underground, but don't ruin the surprise. Just watch.
Heheheha, yeah!
I'm putting an orchestra together.
Orchestra, huh? Well la dee da.
This is great and all, but don't we have more important things to worry about? We should be making plans. 
We did make plans. We're all picking mini-vacations.
There's no time for vacations.
I'm learning the elements as fast as I can.  I practice hard everyday with Toph and Katara. I've been training my arrows off.
Yeah. What's wrong with having a little fun in our downtime?
Even if you do master all of the elements, then what? It's not like we have a map of the fire nation. Should we just head west until we reach the Fire Lord's house?  Knock, knock! Hello, Fire Lord? Anybody home?  I don't think so. We need some intelligence if we're gonna win this war.
Alright, we'll finish our vacations, and then we'll look for Sokka's intelligence.
Your turn, Katara.  Where would you like to go on your mini-vacation? 
How about the Misty Palms Oasis? That sounds refreshing.
Oh yeah, I've been there. It's a pristine natural ice spring, and I usually don't use the word pristine. It's one of nature's wonders.
Must have changed ownership since I was here. 
I don't see anything wrong with having one of those fruity beverages while we plan our strategy.
Excuse me!
No worries, I clean up easy.
Thanks. I try.
The southern temple.
Uh, are fruit pies an agricultural product?
So professor, you're obviously a well traveled guy. Do you have a more current map? Ours seems to be a little dated.
What, no Fire Nation?  Doesn't anybody have a good map of that place?
You've made a lot of trips into the desert.
You spent years walking through the desert to find some guy's library? 
Mm, sounds like good times.
Oh, so this spirit has attractive assistants, huh?
I think he means they look like actual foxes, Sokka.
If this place has books from all over the world, do you think they've got info on the Fire Nation? A map maybe?
Then it's settled.  Aang, I do believe it's my turn. I'd like to spend my vacation  AT THE LIBRARY!
Uh, hey? What about me? When do I get to pick?
You gotta work here a little longer before you qualify for vacation time.
Professor, would you like to see our sky bison?
Wow, shouldn't be too hard to find a place like this out here.
Aw, does this place even exist?
Shouldn't you have mentioned that before? 
There it is!
That's what it will sound like when one of you spots it.
It shouldn't be this hard to spot a giant ornate building from the air.
Down there. What's that?
Forget it. It's obviously not what we're looking for. The building in this drawing is enormous.
What kind of animal is that?
No, this is the library.  Look!
It's completely buried.
Actually,  that won't be necessary. The inside seems to be completely intact, and it's huge.
That fox thingy went in through a window. I say we climb up there and give it a look.
I say you guys go ahead without me.
You got something against libraries?
I've held books before, and I gotta tell you, they don't exactly do it for me.
Oh, right. Sorry.
Let me know if they have something you can listen to.
Don't worry buddy. I'm not making you go underground ever again. You can stay out here with Toph.
What's up?
Nothing. We just like architecture.
I know you're back there.
You should leave the way you came,  unless you want to become a stuffed head of anthropology.
Are you the spirit who brought this library to the physical world?
Indeed, I am Wan Shi Tong, he who knows 10,000 things. And you are obviously humans, which by the way are no longer permitted in my study.
What do you have against humans?
What? Oh, no, no, no destroying, we're not into that.
Um, knowledge, for, knowledge's sake.
I'm not lying. I'm here with the Avatar,  and he's the bridge between our worlds, he'll vouch for me. 
Ow.  Uh, yeah, I'll vouch. We will not abuse the knowledge in your library, good spirit.  You have my word.
I have an authentic waterbending scroll.
Uh, oh, I know!  Ha! 
Oh, great spirit,  check this out!  Ta da!
It's a special knot! That counts as knowledge.
Bright enough to fool you.
So, you like flyin'?
Of course, I'm more comfortable on the ground, where I can see. Well, I don't see the way you do. I feel the vibration in the ground with my feet,  but this sand is so loose and shifty, it makes everything look fuzzy.
Not that there's anything wrong with fuzzy.
Hey, look at these weird lion turtle things.
Eh, I've seen weirder.
Aang, did you know in a past life, you were left handed?
I always knew I was special.
The darkest day in Fire Nation history. It's got a date at the top, but it doesn't say anything else.
Sokka, where are you going?
I want to know what happened to the Fire Nation on their darkest day. This could be promising.  The information on the Fire Nation should be right up here.
Firebender.
They destroyed everything having to do with the Fire Nation.
That's so unfair!  Just when I think I'm one step ahead of the Fire Nation, it turns out they beat us here a long time ago.
I need to know what happened on the darkest day.
Hello, little weird fox guy.
Um, sure, I'll guess I'll follow you.
Uh, this is beautiful, but, how is it helpful?
Maybe these dials represent dates and times.  Sokka, try entering that date from the parchment you took.
Shh! Katara!  Not in front of the fox, he's with the owl.
Wow, I gotta hand it to you Sokka. You picked the best mini-vacation, for sure.
Hey wait, what happened to the sun?
Great, you must have broken it.
It's not broken.
The sun is behind the moon, it's a solar eclipse! It's literally the darkest day in Fire Nation history. Now I get it!  Something awful happened on that day, I don't know what, but I do know why.
Firebenders loose their bending during a solar eclipse!  Sorry.
That makes sense.  I mean, think of what the lunar eclipse at the North Pole did to the waterbenders. This is huge.
Fine, you earned it.
We've got to get this information to the Earth King at Ba Sing Se. We'll wait for the next eclipse,  then we'll invade the Fire Nation when they're totally helpless. The Fire Lord is goin' down! 
You don't understand.  If anyone's evil, it's the Fire Nation. You saw what they did to your library. They're destructive and dangerous. We need this information.
We had no choice. Please, we're just desperate to protect the people we love.
What are you doing?
He's sinking the building! We've gotta get out of here!
I already told you, I don't want to snuggle.
The library's sinking. The library's sinking! 
We've gotta get back to the surface.
Sokka, let's go!
But we still don't know when the next eclipse is gonna happen.
Don't be stupid, we'll find out later.
No, we won't.  If we leave this place we'll never get the information.  Aang, come with me to the planetarium, I need cover.
Katara, take Momo and get out of here.
But-
Go!
Hurry, Sokka!
What is it now?
Who's there?
Why are we doing this? 
Because if this calendar can tell us about eclipses in the past, then maybe it can project when the next one will be. 
You can't possibly check every single date.
I don't have to.  We just have to check every date before Sozin's comet arrives, because after that... Well, try not to think about that.
Come on, eclipse!
That's it, the solar eclipse!  It's just a few months away.
Got it.  Now, let's get to Ba Sing Se.
Don't make me put this down.
No, stop sinking!
No!  I'm sorry Appa. 
That's called Sokka style.  Learn it!
Wait!  Professor, let's go!
Just go!
We got it. There's a solar eclipse coming.  The Fire Nation's in trouble, now!
Where's Appa?
You guys are gonna be done soon, right? 
We've got a lot of ground to cover if we wanna make it to Omashu today.
What, like you're ready to go right now, naked guy?
I can be ready in two minutes. Seriously.  Whenever.
So, you were showing me the octopus form.
Right. Let me see your stance.  Your arms are too far apart. See, if you move them closer together you protect your center. You got it?
Oh... yeah. Thanks.
Okay, let's see what you got.
You make a fine octopus, Pupil Aang.
Don't fall in love with a traveling girl. She'll leave you broke and broken hearted...
Heh-hey! River people!
We're not river people.
You're not? Well then what kind of people are ya?
Just... people.
Aren't we all, brother? Whoo.
Who're you?
I'm Chong, and this is my wife Lily.  We're nomads, happy to go wherever the wind takes us! 
You guys are nomads That's great! I'm a nomad.
Hey, me too.
I know... you just said that.
Oh.  Nice underwear.
I didn't find anything to eat. I can't live like this. I wasn't meant to be a fugitive.  This is impossible!
Uncle... what are you doing?
You're looking at the rare white dragon bush.  Its leaves make a tea so delicious it's heartbreaking!  That, or it's the white jade bush, which is poisonous.
We need food, not tea. I'm going fishing.
Delectable tea? Or deadly poison? 
Hey, Sokka, you should hear some of these stories. These guys have been everywhere.
Well, not everywhere, Little Arrowhead. But where we haven't been we've heard about through stories and songs.
They said they'll take us to see a giant night crawler.
On the way there's a waterfall that creates a never-ending rainbow.
Look, I hate to be the wet blanket here, but since Katara is busy I guess it's up to me.  We need to get to Omashu.  No sidetracks, no worms, and definitely no rainbows.
Whoa... sounds like someone's got a case of "destination fever," heh. You're worried too much about where you're going.
You've gotta focus less on the "where" and more on the "going."
O. Ma. Shu.
Sokka's right. We need to find King Bumi so Aang can learn earthbending somewhere safe.
Well, sounds like you're headed to Omashu.  There's an old story about a secret pass...  ...right through the mountains.
Is this real or a legend?
Oh, it's a real legend. And it's as old as earthbending itself.  Two lovers, forbidden from one another... a war divides their people, and a mountain divides them apart. Built a path to be together.  Yeah, and I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes...  Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountain! Secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel! Yeah!
I think we'll just stick with flying. We've dealt with the Fire Nation before. We'll be fine.
Yeah. Thanks for the help, but Appa hates going underground and we need to do whatever makes Appa most comfortable.
Launch!
Secret love cave. Let's go.
Zuko, remember that plant that I thought might be tea?
You didn't!
I did.  And it wasn't. 
Yah!
When the rash spreads to my throat, I will stop breathing.  But look what I found! These are bacui berries, known to cure the poison of the white jade plant. That, or macahoni berries that cause blindness.
We're not taking any more chances with these plants! We need to get help.
But where are we going to go? We're enemies of the Earth Kingdom, and fugitives from the Fire Nation.
If the Earth Kingdom, discovers us, they'll have us killed.
But if the Fire Nation discovers us, we'll be turned over to Azula.
Earth Kingdom it is.
How far are we from the tunnel.
Actually, it's not just one tunnel. The lovers didn't want anyone to find out about their love, so they built a whole labyrinth.
Labyrinth !
I'm sure we'll figure it out.
All you need to do is trust in love. According to the curse.
Curse!
Hey-hey, we're here!
What exactly is this curse?
The curse says that only those who trust in love can make it through the caves. Otherwise you'll be trapped in them forever.
And die.
Oh, yeah, and die. Hey, I just remembered the rest of that song.  And die!
That's it! There's no way we're going througbrh some cursed hole!
Hey, someone's making a big campfire!
That's no campfire, Moku.
That's Fire Nation. They're tracking us.
So all you need is to trust in love to get through these caves?
That is correct, Master Arrowhead.
We can make it.
Everyone into the hole!
Hold on! It's too dangerous.  Haven't you heard the song? Just close them in. The mountain will take care of the rest.
It's okay, Appa. We'll be fine.  I hope.
We will be fine. All we need is a plan. Chong, how long do those torches last?
Eh, about two hours each.
And we have five torches so that's...  ten hours. 
It doesn't work like that if they're all lit at the same time!
Ohh, right.
I'm gonna make a map to keep track of exactly where we've been. Then we should be able to solve it like a maze and get through.
You two must not be from around here. We know better than to touch the white jade, much less make it into tea and drink it.
Heh heh heh. Whoops!
So where are you traveling from?
Yes, we're travelers.
Do you have names?
Names Of course we have names. I'm... Lee. And this is my uncle, uh... Mushi. 
Yes, but my nephew was named after his father, so we just call him Junior.
Mushi and Junior, huh? My name is Song. You two look like you could use a good meal.  Why don't you stay for dinner 
Sorry, but we need to be moving on.
That's too bad. My mom always makes too much roast duck.
Where do you live, exactly?
Sokka, this is the tenth dead end you've led us to.
This doesn't make any sense; we already came through this way.
We don't need a map. We just need love.  The little guy knows it.
Yeah, but I wouldn't mind a map, also.
There's something strange here. There's only one explanation. The tunnels are changing.
When I was a little girl, the Fire Nation raided our farming village. All the men were taken away.  That was the last time I saw my father.
I haven't seen my father in many years.
Oh. Is he fighting in the war?
Yeah.
The tunnels... they're a-changin'. Ah, it must be the curse. I knew we shouldn't have come down here.
Right. If only we listened to you.
Everyone be quiet. Listen.
It's a giant flying thing with teeth!
No! It's a wolf-bat!
Yeah, it's no use. We're separated. But at least you have us, heh heh.
Noooooooo! 
Can I join you? I know what you've been through. We've all been through it. The Fire Nation has hurt you. 
It's okay. They've hurt me, too. 
Oh, don't let the cave in get you down. Don't let the falling rocks turn your smile into a frown. When the tunnels are darkest that's when you need a clown, hey! Don't let the cave in get you down, Sokka!
Aang, look!
We found the exit!
This isn't the exit.
No... it's a tomb.
It must be the two lovers from the legend. That's who's buried here.
These pictures tell their story.
They met on top of the mountain that divided their two villages. 
The villages were enemies so they could not be together.
But their love was strong and they found a way.
The two lovers learned earthbending from the badger moles. They became the first earthbenders.
They built elaborate tunnels so they could meet secretly. Anyone who tried to follow them would be lost forever in the labyrinth.
But one day the man didn't come. 
He died in the war between their two villages.
Devastated, the woman unleashed a terrible display of her earthbending power. She could have destroyed them all. 
But instead she declared the war over. 
Both villages helped her build a new city where they would live together in peace. 
The woman's name was Oma and the man's name was Shu. The great city was named Omashu as a monument to their love.
Love is brightest in the dark.
Oh, great! Your plans have led us to another dead end!
At least I'm thinking of ideas and trying to get us out of here, Moku.
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute; we're thinking of ideas! 'Cause I've had an idea for, like, an hour now.
Yes! We're all thinking of ideas!
Well, then listen to this: if love is the key out of here, then all we need to do is play a love song.
How are we gonna find our way out of these tunnels?
I have a crazy idea.
What?
Never mind, it's too crazy.
Katara, what is it?
I was thinking... the curse says we'll be trapped in here forever unless we trust in love.
Right...
And here it says 'love is brightest in the dark' and...  has a picture of them kissing.
Where are you going with this?
Well... what if we kissed?
Us, kissing?
See? It was a crazy idea.
Us... kissing...
Us kissing. What was I thinking? Can you imagine that?
Yeah, heh, heh.  I definitely wouldn't wanna kiss you! 
Oh, well I didn't realize it was such a horrible option.  Sorry I suggested it!
No, no, I mean... if there was a choice between kissing you and dying...
What? I'm saying I'd rather kiss you than die.  That's a compliment.
Well, I'm not sure which I would rather do!
What is wrong with me?
Even if you're lost you can't lose the love because it's in your heart, ooooohhhhh...
Thank you for the duck. It was excellent.
Much practice.  Junior, where are your manners? You need to thank these nice people.
Thank you.
I know you don't think there's any hope left in the world, but there is hope. The Avatar has returned!
I know.
What are you doing? These people just showed you great kindness.
They're about to show us a little more kindness.  Well?
We're gonna run out of light any second now, aren't we?
I think so.
Then what are we gonna do?
What can we do?
Hey-hey, you saved us, Sokka!
No, they were trying to get away from something.
From what?
Hey, those things are music lovers!
Badger moles, coming toward me. Come on guys, help me out.
The big bad badger moles who work in the tunnels, hate the wolf bats but love the sounds.
It's made of some kind of crystals. They must only light up in the dark!
That's how the two lovers found each other. They just put out their lights and followed the crystals. 
That must be the way out!
So... um...
Let's go!
What about Sokka?
Sokka!
How did you guys get out?
Just like the legend says: we let love lead the way.
Really? We let huge ferocious beasts lead our way.
Why is your forehead all red?
Nobody react to what I'm about to tell you. I think that kid might be the Avatar.
So, are you guys gonna come to Omashu with us?
Nope.
Okay. Thanks for everything, Moku.
Sokka, I hope you learned a little something about not letting the plans get in the way of the journey.
Just play your songs.
Hey, good plan!  Even if you're lost you can't lose the love because it's in your heart. Ooooohhhh...
The journey was long and annoying, but now you get to see what it's really about - the destination. 
I present to you the Earth Kingdom city of O...  Oh, no...
I can't believe it. I know the war has spread far,  but Omashu always seemed...untouchable.
Up until now, it was. Now Ba-Sing-Se is the only great Earth Kingdom stronghold left.
This is horrible, but we have to move on.
No. I'm going in to find Bumi.
Aang, stop. We don't even know if Bumi's still...
What? If he's still what?
...around.
I know you had your heart set on Bumi, but there are other people around who can teach you earthbending.
This isn't about finding a teacher. This is about finding my friend.
A secret passage? 
Why didn't we just use this last time?  Ugh!
Does that answer your question?
Ew!
That wasn't as bad as I thought.
Aaahhh!
Aaahh! Aahhh! They won't let go! Help! Aaaak!
Stop making so much noise. It's just a purple pentapus.
Hey!
What are you kids doing out past curfew?
Sorry. We were just on our way home.
Wait! What's the matter with him?
Uh...he has pentapox, sir.
Um...it's highly contagious!
Uuuuuu....It's so awful...I'm dyiiiing...
...and deadly...
Wait, I think I've heard of pentapox.  Didn't your cousin Chang die of it?
We'd better go wash our hands...and burn our clothes!
Thank you, sewer friend!
You're right. The royal procession is dead weight. If I want to catch my prey, I must be agile....nimble. I need a small, elite team. It's time to visit some old friends.
Let's find Bumi and get out of here.
Where would they be keeping him?
Somewhere he can't earthbend.  Somewhere made of metal.
There really is no fathoming the depths of my hatred for this place.
I thought my life was boring in the Fire Nation. But this place is unbearably bleak. Nothing ever happens.
Ty Lee, could that possibly be you?
Please, don't let me interrupt your...  whatever it is you were doing.
Tell me, what is the daughter of a nobleman doing here? Certainly our parents didn't send us to the Royal Fire Academy for Girls to end up in...  places like this.
I have a proposition for you. I'm hunting a traitor.  You remember my old fuddy duddy uncle, don't you?
I would be honored if you would join me on my mission.
I'll take your word for it. Well, I wouldn't want you to give up the life you love just to please me.
Of course, before I leave, I'm going to catch your show.
So, is King Bumi with you guys? Is he leading the resistance?
Actually there's another path to freedom. You could leave Omashu. You're directing all your energy to fight the Fire Nation.  But you're outnumbered. You can't win. Now's the time to retreat, so you can live to fight another day.
Suckers!
You're all about to come down with a nasty case of pentapox.
The marks make ya look sick, but you gotta ACT sick, too. Ya gotta sell it!
Now that's what I'm talkin' about.
Okay everyone! Into sick formation.
Aang, what are you doing? Aren't you coming with us.
No. I'm not leaving until I find Bumi.
Sorry Momo, I'll feed you later.
Plague! Plague!
What is going on down there?
I saw some kids yesterday who were sick with pentapox. It must have spread!
Pentapox! I'm pretty sure I've heard of that.
What should we do?
Drive them out of the city...but don't touch them! We have to rid the city of this disease!
Fire flakes, Dad?
Flopsie!
Come on, Flopsie. You gotta help me find Bumi. Yip Yip! Oh...I guess that doesn't work with you. Let's go!
I will.
Incredible. Do you think she'll fall?
Then wouldn't it make it more interesting if you removed the net?
You're right, you're right. That's been done.  I know. Set the net on fire.
Brilliant, just brilliant!  Oooo, what kind of dangerous animals do you have?
Release them all!
We looked everywhere. No Bumi.
Oh no. Did someone get left behind?
So, the resistance has kidnapped my son.  Everything so clever, so tricky. Just like their King Bumi.
What do you want to do, sir?
What an exquisite performance. I can't wait to see how you'll top yourself tomorrow.
Really?
No! Bad Fire Nation baby!
Oh...alright.
Ooo, you're so CUTE. Mmmmm...
Does that look like the face of a killer to you?
It's from the Fire Nation governor. He thinks we kidnapped his son. So...he wants to make a trade. His son  for King Bumi.
You realize we're probably walking right into a trap?
I don't think so. I'm sure the Governor wants his son back as much as we want Bumi. It's a new day.  I have a good feeling about this.
Please tell me you're here to kill me.
It's great to see you, Mai.
I thought you ran off and joined the circus? You said it was your calling.
I have a mission  and I need you both.
Count me in. Anything to get me out of this place.
I apologize.
You've come to Omashu at a difficult time. At noon we're making a trade with the resistance to get Tom-Tom back.
Yes, I'm so sorry to hear about your son,  but really, what did you expect by just letting all the citizens leave?  My father has trusted you with this city  and you're making a mess of things!
Forgive me, Princess.
You stay here.  Mai will handle the hostage trade so you don't have a chance to mess it up.  And there is no more "Omashu". I'm renaming it in honor of my father, the City of New Ozai. 
You brought my brother?
He's here. We're ready to trade.
I'm sorry, but a thought just occurred to me. Do you mind?
Of course not, Princess Azula.
We're trading a two year old for a king.  A powerful, earthbending king.
It just doesn't seem like a fair trade, does it?
You're right.  The deal's off.
Bumi!
The Avatar!  My lucky day.
Hang on! We're gonna get you out of here.
We've got to get the baby out of here!
Way ahead of ya!
Just like old times, isn't it, Bumi?
It's good to see you too!
How are you gonna fight without your bending?
I seem to manage! 
There's Aang!
We can catch him!
Hang on, Bumi! Our ride's here!
You could earthbend all along!?
I don't understand.  Why didn't you free yourself? Why did you surrender when Omashu was invaded? What's the matter with you, Bumi!?
I know!  There's positive jin when you're attacking, and negative jin when you're retreating.
There are three jins?
That's why you surrendered, isn't it?
I guess I need to find someone else to teach me earthbending.
Hey, Momo!
So, we're tracking down your brother and Uncle, huh?
It's not just Zuko and Iroh anymore. We have a third target now.
I have an idea, why don't we all get on your back and you can fly us to the North Pole?
I'd love to! Climb on everyone , Sokka's ready for takeoff!
Look, we're all just a little tired and cranky because we've been flying for two days straight.
And for what? We can't even find the Northern Water Tribe. There's nothing up here.
They're waterbenders! We found the Water Tribe!
He's heading north. The Northern Water Tribe. The Avatar needs to master waterbending. He's looking for a teacher.
Patience, Captain Li. This isn't some little Earth village we can just march into. The Water Tribe is a great nation. There's a reason they've survived a hundred years of war. The frozen tundra is treacherous. The landscape itself is an icy fortress. We'll need a massive invasion force.
There it is!
We're finally here...
I can't believe how many waterbenders live up here!
We'll find a master to teach us, no problem!
Ha! Prince of what?
Very smooth.
For the last time, I'm not playing the sumki horn.
No, it's about our plans. There's a bit of a problem.
I'm taking your crew.
I've recruited them for a little expedition to the North Pole.
Uncle, is that true?
I'm afraid so. He's taking everyone.  Even the cook!
Sorry you won't be there to watch me capture the Avatar. But I can't have you getting in my way again.
I didn't know you were skilled with broadswords, Prince Zuko.
I'm not. They're antiques. Just decorative.
Have you heard of the Blue Spirit, General Iroh?
Just rumors. I don't think he is real.
He's real all right. He's a criminal, an enemy of the Fire Nation.  But I have a feeling that justice will catch up with him soon.  General Iroh, the offer to join my mission still stands if you change your mind.
I've waited for this day my whole life! I finally get to learn from a real waterbending master!
Good morning, Master Pakku!
Uhh... this is my friend, Katara, the one I told you about?
What do you mean you won't teach me?  I didn't travel across the entire world so you could tell me “no”!
I don't want to heal, I want to fight!
Well your rules stink!
Yeh! They're not fair. If you won't teach Katara, then –
Then I won't learn from you!
Wait!  Aang didn't mean that.
You can't risk your training for me. You have to learn from Master Pakku. Even if he is a big jerk.
Princess Yue! Good morning!  Hey, how about that picnic last night? Boy, your Dad sure knows how to throw a party.
Well, it wasn't as much fun after you left.
So, I'm still hoping we can see more of each other.
Great! I'll see you – aahh!
I'm very impressed.
You all seem highly qualified for the mission I have in mind.
Um, hi. Are you Yagoda?
Are you here for the healing lesson?
Welcome! Welcome!
Thanks for the lesson.
So, who's the lucky boy?
Huh?
When I was about your age I was friends with Kana. She was born here, in the Northern Tribe.
Your grandmother had an arranged marriage with a young waterbender. He carved that necklace for her.
If Gran-Gran was engaged, why did she leave?
I don't know. That's always been a mystery to me. She left without saying goodbye.
The crew wanted me to wish you safe travels.
Good riddance to those traitors.
It's a lovely night for a walk. Why don't you join me? It would clear your head.  Or, just stay in your room and sit in the dark. Whatever makes you happy.
Zuko!
Hi, Princess Yue.  I made you something. I carved it myself.
Actually, it's a fish , see it has a fin.
How's warrior training going?
That bad?
No, it's Princess Yue. I don't get it. One minute she wants to go out with me and the next she's telling me to get lost!  So how's waterbending training?
Master Poophead won't teach her because she's a girl.
Why don't you just teach her, Aang?
I'm not happy.
But you're never happy. Come on, Aang.
Master Pakku said this move is all about sinking and floating.
I got it!
That was amazing!
That wasn't me.
I... I was just showing Katara a few moves.
I'm sorry, I –
Yes – please!
Fine.
No! No way am I apologizing to a sour old man like you!
Uh, Katara...
I'm sure she didn't mean that.
Yeh, I think she did.
I'm devastated to hear about Prince Zuko.  Just devastated.
Yes...  pirates! We had a run in with them awhile back.
They wanted revenge.
Are you crazy, Katara? You're not gonna win this fight!
You don't have to do this for me. I can find another teacher.
I'm not doing it for you! Someone needs to slap some sense into that guy!
So, you decided to show up?  Aren't you gonna fight?
You can't knock me down!
Go Katara!
But you still won't teach me, will you?
Come back here! I'm not finished yet!
No it's not, it's mine! Give it back!
My Gran-Gran was supposed to marry you?
Our plan is working perfectly. Zhao doesn't suspect a thing.
No nephew of mine is going to stow away on a ship without some backup!
Thank you, Uncle.
But she didn't love you, did she? It was an arranged marriage.
Go get her.
Nothing. I just want you to know, I think you're beautiful... and, I never thought a girl like you would even notice a guy like me.
No, no, see, that's the thing. I think I do understand now. You're a princess, and I... I'm just a southern peasant.
It's okay. You don't have to say anything.  I'll see ya around, okay?
Okay, now I'm really confused! Happy – but confused!
Hey Katara!
Good to see ya here.
My fleet is ready. Set a course for the Northern Water Tribe.
I can't believe I lost him.
You did everything you could and now we need to do everything we can to get him back.
It's all right. You stay here, Momo, in case Aang comes back.
Yip! Yip!
Hello? I'm sorry to disturb you, but I just really need to find the Moon and the Ocean spirits.
Yes! I need –
Roku!
Shelter!
Roku, the Water Tribe is under attack. I need to find the Ocean and Moon spirits!
Who?
I finally have you. But I can't get you home because of this blizzard.  There's always something. Not that you would understand. You're like my sister. Everything always...came easy to her. She's a firebending prodigy – and everyone adores her.  My father says she was born lucky. He says I was lucky to be born.  I don't need luck though, I don't want it. I've always had to struggle and fight and that's made me strong. It's made me who I am.
I was a young Lieutenant serving under General Shu in the Earth Kingdom...
I discovered a hidden library, underground in fact. I tore through scroll after scroll. One of them contained a detailed illustration and the words "moon" and "ocean." I knew then that these spirits could be found – and killed.  And that it was my destiny to do so.
Hello? I'm looking for a spirit named "Koh."
Welcome! 
Thank you. 
My old friend, the Avatar. It's been a long time.
You know me?
...you! One of your previous incarnations tried  to slay me! It was eight or nine hundred years ago.
I didn't know that. Why did he... or I... try to kill you?
Oh... it was something about stealing the face of someone you loved... . Of course, that's all behind us. Why should I hold a grudge against you for something in a past life? After all, you're a different person now.  You've come to me... with a new face.
Guess we'll be here awhile.
I'm not worried they'll get away in the blizzard. I'm worried that they won't.
They're not gonna die in this blizzard. If we know anything it's that Zuko never gives up. They'll survive – and we'll find them!
It's been a long time since I've added a child's face to my collection.  So... how may I help you?
I need to find the Moon and the Ocean.
Their spirit names are Tui and La. Push... and Pull... and that has been the nature of their relationship for all time.
Please, help me find them. An entire culture could be destroyed if I don't get their help.
Oh, you think you need their help? Actually, it's quite the other way around.
Someone's going to kill them!
What do you mean? How can I find them and protect them?
Tui and La, your Moon and Ocean, have always circled each other in an eternal dance. They balance each other... push and pull... life and death... good and evil... yin... and yang.
I must be going now.
The spirits are in trouble. I need to get back to the physical world.
Hei-Bai!
We'll be following this map to a very special location. And when we get there...  ...we're going fishing.
Momo! 
Look! That's gotta be Aang!
Welcome back.
That won't be enough to escape.
Appa!
Hey! This is some quality rope!
We need to get to the oasis! The spirits are in trouble!
Wait, we can't just leave him here. 
Sure we can. Let's go.
No, if we leave him, he'll die.
Yeh, this makes a lot of sense. Let's bring the guy who's constantly trying to kill us!
Are you okay?
What do you mean?
I am...  a legend now! The Fire Nation will for generations tell stories about the great Zhao who darkened the moon! They will call me Zhao the Conqueror! Zhao the Moon Slayer! ZHAO THE INVINCIBLE!
Huh! Get it off!
Don't bother!
Zhao! Don't!
It's my destiny... to destroy the Moon... and the Water Tribe.
Destroying the moon won't just hurt the Water Tribe. It will hurt everyone – including you. Without the moon, everything would fall out of balance. You have no idea what kind of chaos that would unleash on the world.
I'm no traitor, Zhao, the Fire Nation needs the moon too. We all depend on the balance.
Whatever you do to that spirit I'll unleash on you ten-fold!  LET IT GO, NOW!
You tried to have me killed!
You freed the Avatar!
I had no choice!
You should have chosen to accept your failure – your disgrace! Then, at least you could have lived! 
It's too late. It's dead.
You have been touched by the Moon Spirit. Some of its life is in you!
Take my hand!
What about Aang?  He still needs to learn waterbending.
You must be proud.
I'm surprised, Prince Zuko, surprised that you are not at this moment trying to capture the Avatar.
I'm tired.
You too, Momo.
Yes, Master Pakku?
I wouldn't say "mastered", but check this out!
What's wrong? We're taking a walk!
I know what you need!  You need to meet my good friend Appa!
Appa and I go way back. Don't we boy?
Ahh! Easy!
Down boy! Ahh! No! Up!
You hangin' on tight?
Yip...  ...yip!
Not when you're with someone.
Yeh.
Whoo! Yeh! Good times! Good times!
I've seen it before. Right before my village was attacked. It's soot mixed with snow.
It's the Fire Nation. They've closed in on the North Pole. And from the looks of the stuff...
...I'd say there's a lot of them.
Just think, centuries from now, people will study the great Admiral Zhao who destroyed the last of the Water Tribe civilization. You're lucky you're here to see it.
Be careful what you wish for, Admiral. History is not always kind to its subjects.
I suppose you speak from experience? But rest assured, this will be nothing like your legendary failure at Ba-Sing-Se.
I hope not, for your sake.
Tell the Captains to prepare for first strike.
What's wrong?  We have to go!
You don't love him, do you? You don't even seem to like him.
You're not marrying them.
Sokka!
I wasn't there when the Fire Nation attacked my people.  I'm gonna make a difference this time.
Yip! Yip!
Katara!?
I'll take it from here, boy!
Appa!
Thanks for the rescue, buddy!
You have got to be kidding me.
What's your problem?
Of course they do. These are real uniforms captured from actual Fire Navy soldiers.
When, like a hundred years ago?
His name is Zhao. Middle-aged. Big sideburns. Bigger temper.
Princess Yue's marrying you?
Yeh, what of it?
It's almost twilight, Admiral. As your military consultant I must advise you to halt your attack. The waterbenders draw their power from the moon and it is nearly full tonight. You should wait and resume the attack at daybreak. 
Oh, I'm well aware of the moon problem and I am working on a solution. But for now, daybreak it is. 
I can't do it.  I can't do it.
What happened?
I must have taken out a dozen Fire Navy ships, but there's just too many of them. I can't fight them all.
I'm just one kid.
If you're fishing for an octopus, my nephew, you need a tightly woven net or he will squeeze through the tiniest hole and escape.
I don't need your wisdom right now, Uncle.
I'm sorry, I just nag you because, well, ever since I lost my son...
Uncle, you don't have to say it.
I think of you as my own.
I know, Uncle.  We'll meet again...
Remember your Breathe of Fire! It could save your life out there!
I will.
And put your hood up, keep your ears warm!
I mean, Yue's nice and everything, but the points I'll get with the Chief aren't bad either.
Princess Yue is wasted on a self absorbed weasel like you!
Whoa. Hang on. What do you care? You're just a simple rube from the Southern Tribe. What would you know of the political complexities of our life? No offense.
You're just a jerk without a soul! No offense!
Where are they going? They're coming up for air somewhere...
I've always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night. 
The Avatar is the bridge between our world and the Spirit World. Aang can talk to them!
Or wisdom. That's good too.
The only problem is, last time you got to the Spirit World by accident. How are you going to get there this time?
So is this the way to the Spirit World?
I never thought I'd miss grass this much!
You're right, Yue. I can feel...something...it's so...tranquil.
Oh no! Hahn's out there on the top secret mission while I'm here sharpening my boomerang. Everything's fine!
How 'bout some quiet!?  C'mon guys! I can hear every word you're saying!
He's crossing into the Spirit World. He'll be fine as long as we don't move his body. That's his way back to the physical world.
No, he's my friend. I'm perfectly capable of protecting him.
Yes! Hand him over, and I won't have to hurt you.
It's daybreak at last. Let's write history. 
You rise with the moon. I rise with the sun.
The Water Tribe can try to resist the inevitable , but their city will fall today.
What happened? Where's Zuko?
Aaahhh!  Oof!
Aang?
Do you wanna talk about it?
Nah. Just a nightmare.
I was in the Avatar state, but I was outside my body watching myself. It was scary. I was scary.
Thank you, Master Pakku. 
Appa, yip yip!
Say hi to Gran Gran for me! 
Aaahhh... this is what I've been missing. Who knew floating on a piece of driftwood for three weeks with no food or water and sea vultures waiting to pluck out your liver could make one so tense?
I see. It's the anniversary, isn't it?
Three years ago today I was banished. I lost it all.   I want it back. I want the Avatar, I want my honor, I want my throne. I want my father not to think I'm worthless.
I'm sure he doesn't! Why would he banish you if he didn't care?
Erg... that came out wrong, didn't it?
My brother and my uncle have disgraced the Fire Lord and brought shame on all of us. You may have mixed feelings about attacking members of the royal family; I understand. But I assure you, if you hesitate, I will not hesitate to bring you down. Dismissed.
Princess, I'm afraid the tides will not allow us to bring the ship in to port before nightfall.
I'm sorry, Captain, but I do not know much about the tides. Can you explain something to me?
Of course, Your Highness.
Do the tides command this ship?
Uh... I'm afraid I do not understand.
You said the tides would not allow us to bring the ship in. Do the tides command this ship?
No, Princess.
And if I were to have you thrown overboard, would the tides think twice about smashing you against the rocky shore?
No, Princess.
Well, then, maybe you should worry less about the tides who've already made up their mind about killing you and worry more about me, who's still mulling it over.
I'll pull us in. 
There it is!
"Mighty Katara"? I like that.
Not bad, not bad.
I try not to think about it too much.
What?! No I'm not!
Aang still needs to master all four elements.
But, sir, the thing is Aang can only do those things when he's in the Avatar state.
See, it's this special state where—
Right... but I'm don't know how to get in or out of the Avatar state, much less what to do once I'm there.
No, nothing's decided. We already have a plan. Aang's pursuing his destiny his way.
'Almost' isn't good enough!
General Fong?
I'm in.  I'll fight the Fire Lord.
I told the general I'd help him... by going into the Avatar state.
Aang, no. This is not the right way.
Why not? Remember when he took out the Fire Navy? He was incredible.
There's a right way to do this. Practice, study, and discipline.
Or just glow it up and stop that Fire Lord.
If you two meatheads want to throw away everything we've worked for, fine. Go ahead and glow it up! 
Katara, I'm just being realistic. I don't have time to do this the right way. 
This rare chi-enhancing tea is a natural stimulant. In an ordinary warrior it improves strength and energy ten-fold. In you, it may induce the Avatar state. 
Ten-fold energy, huh? 
Is it working, is it working? I can't tell! Somebody tell me if I'm in the Avatar state 'cause I don't have a good view of myself! Am I talking too loud?
I guess he could talk the Fire Lord to death.
Ooof!
Maybe I can shock you into the Avatar state.
I love surprises.
Raahh!
Aaahhh!  Still not glowing.
You are wearing a ceremonial piece of clothing from each of the bending nations. Now I will join the four elements into one!  Water, earth, fire, air! Four elements together as one! 
This is just mud!
So... do you feel anything?
Aaaaachoooo!
Look at these magnificent shells! I'll enjoy these keepsakes for years to come.
We don't need anymore useless things. You forget we have to carry everything ourselves now.
Hello, brother. Uncle.
What are you doing here?
In my country, we exchange a pleasant 'hello' before asking questions.  Have you become uncivilized so soon, Zuzu?
Don't call me that!
To what do we owe this honor?
Hmm... must be a family trait. Both of you so quick to get to the point.  I've come with a message from home. Father's changed his mind. Family is suddenly very important to him. He's heard rumors of plans to overthrow him—treacherous plots. Family are the only ones you can really trust.  Father regrets your banishment. He wants you home.
Did you hear me? You should be happy. Excited. Grateful.  I just gave you great news.
I'm sure your brother just needs a moment to—
Don't interrupt, Uncle!  I still haven't heard my thank you. I am not a messenger. I didn't have to come all this way.
Father regrets? He... wants me back?
I can see you need time to take this in. I'll come to call on you tomorrow. Good evening. 
Can we talk about something?
Sure.
Do you remember when we were at the air temple and you found Monk Gyatso's skeleton? It must have been so horrible and traumatic for you. I saw you get so upset that you weren't even you anymore. I'm not saying the Avatar state doesn't have incredible—and helpful power. But you have to understand, for the people who love you, watching you be in that much rage and pain is really scary.
I'm really glad you told me that. But I still need to do this.
I don't understand.
No, you don't. Every day more and more people die. I'm already a hundred years late. Defeating the Fire Lord is the only way to stop this war. I have to try it.
I can't watch you do this to yourself. I'm not coming tomorrow.  Goodnight. 
Goodnight.
We're going home. After three long years. It's unbelievable. 
It is unbelievable. I have never known my brother to regret anything.
Did you listen to Azula? Father's realized how important family is to him. He cares about me.
I care about you. And if Ozai wants you back... well, I think it may not be for the reasons you imagine.
You don't know how my father feels about me.  You don't know anything.
Zuko, I only meant that in our family things are not always what they seem.
I think you are exactly what you seem: a lazy, mistrustful, shallow old man who has always been jealous of his brother.
Aaahhh!
Sokka. Sokka, wake up.
Wha...?
I don't think we should be trying to bring on the Avatar state.
You sure?
Yes.
Okay.
Do you think the general will be mad?
What can he say? You're the Avatar. Who knows better than you?
Wait!  Don't leave without me!
Uncle! You've changed your mind!
Family sticks together, right?
We're finally going home.
The thing is, I don't think we'll ever be able to trigger it on purpose. So, I guess that's it.
I'm sure. I can only reach the Avatar state when I'm in genuine danger.
Ugh!
Aang!
Aaahhh!
What are you doing?
I am not your enemy! I won't fight you!
You can't fight forever!
Brother! Uncle!  Welcome. I'm so glad you decided to come.
Are we ready to depart, Your Highness?
Set our course for home, Captain.
Home...
You heard the princess! Raise the anchors! We're taking the prisoners ho— 
Your Highness... I...
You lied to me!
Like I've never done that before.
Aaahhh!
I wonder what crazy thing they're trying now.  Maybe we should just make sure Aang's okay.
What's going on?
The general's gone crazy. He's trying to force Aang into the Avatar state!
Good bird/horse thingy.
Aaahhh!  I can't move!
Don't hurt her!
Aaahhh!
Katara! No!  Waaaahhh! Oof!
Stop this! You have to let her go.
I'm trying... I'm trying!
Aang, I'm sinking!
Aaahhh! Please!
You don't need to do this!
Zuko! Let's go!
You know Father blames Uncle for the loss at the North Pole. And he considers you a miserable failure for not finding the Avatar.  Why would he want you back home, except to lock you up where you can no longer embarrass him?
It's time you learned.
The Avatar state is a defense mechanism, designed to empower you with the skills and knowledge of all the past Avatars. 
The glow is the combination of all your past lives, focusing their energy through your body. 
In the avatar state you are at your most powerful,  but you are also at your most vulnerable.
What do you mean?
If you are killed in the Avatar state, the reincarnation cycle will be broken and the Avatar will cease to exist.
I'm sorry, Katara. I hope you never have to see me like that again. 
You're out of your mind.
Anybody got a problem with that? 
Do you still want an escort to Omashu?
I think we're all set.
Anyone who harbors these traitors will face the wrath of the Fire Lord.
There will be no place left to hide.
I think we're safe here.
What happened? 
Oh no!
Momo?
Twinkle-Toes, that's got to be you.
Aang, you're awake!
Are you sure?  I feel like I'm dreaming. 
You're not dreaming. You're finally awake. 
Aang, good to see you back with the living, buddy.
Sokka?
Uh-oh! Somebody catch him, he's gonna...
Ughh.
Aren't you cold? 
I've got a lot on my mind. It's been so long. Over three years since I was home. I wonder what's changed. I wonder how I've changed.
I just asked if you were cold. I didn't ask for your whole life story.  Stop worrying.
Why are we on a Fire Nation ship? Why is everyone dressed this way? And why am I the only one out of it?
You need to take it easy, o.k? You got hurt pretty bad. I like your hair.
I have hair? How long was I out?
A few weeks.
Everything ok?
We're fine, Dad.
I'm Hakoda, Katara and Sokka's father.
He knows who you are. I just called you "Dad", didn't I?
I guess you're right. 
Nice to officially meet you, Chief Hakoda .
It's an honor to meet you. 
Great, great. Now you guys have finally met, so would you mind giving us a little privacy?
Of course.
Are you mad at your dad or something?
What? Not at all, why would you say that?
Mmm-emmm .
Maybe we should go upstairs. You need a healing session. 
Tell me where your pain feels most intense. 
A little higher. 
Wow, you are definitely in the right area there.
I can feel a lot of energy twisted up around there. Let me just see if I can...
I went down! I didn't just get hurt, did I? It was worse than that. I was gone. But you brought me back.
I just used the spirit water from the North Pole. I don't know what I did, exactly. 
You saved me.
You need to rest.
After what happened in Ba Sing Se, we had to get you to safety. 
We flew back to  Chameleon Bay, where we found my father and the other Water Tribe men. 
The Earth King decided he wanted to travel the world in disguise, so he set off alone. 
Well, not completely alone. 
Soon, the bay was overrun with Fire Nation ships. Rather than fight them all, we captured a single ship and made it our disguise. 
Since then, we've been traveling west . We crossed through The Serpent's Pass a few days ago. We've seen a few Fire Nation ships, but none have bothered us. 
So, what now?
We've been working on a modified version of the invasion plan.
It's Sokka's invasion plan.
Yes, Sokka's plan. We won't be able to mount a massive invasion without the Earth King's armies, but the solar eclipse will still leave the Fire Nation vulnerable. 
So we're planning a smaller invasion. Just a ragtag team of our friends and allies from around the Earth Kingdom. We already ran into Pipsqueak and The Duke.
Good to see you again, Aang.
And the best part is, the eclipse isn't even our biggest advantage.  We have a secret . You!
Me?
Yep, the whole world thinks you're dead!  Isn't that great?!
The world thinks I'm dead? How is that good news? That's terrible!
No, it's great. It means the Fire Nation won't be hunting us anymore. And even better, they won't expect you on The Day of Black Sun.
No, no, no, no, no. You have no idea. This is so messed up! 
I'll handle this. The Avatar is back! 
Aang, wait. Remember, they don't know we're not Fire Nation.
Everyone just stay calm. Bato and I will take care of this.
I hate not being able to do anything.
Hopefully, you won't need to.
Actually, we're from the Eastern Fleet. We have orders to deliver some cargo.
I am sure Admiral Chan meant no disrespect, sir. 
Next time, we'll send two hawks to be sure you get the message.
They know!
You seem so downcast. Has Mai gotten to you already? Though actually, Mai has been in a strangely good mood lately. 
I haven't seen Dad yet. I haven't seen him in three years, since I was banished.
So what?
So, I didn't capture the Avatar.
Who cares? The Avatar's dead. Unless you think he somehow miraculously survived.
This is water from the Spirit Oasis, at the North Pole. It has special properties, so I've been saving it for something important.
No. There's no way he could've survived.
Well, then I'm sure you have nothing to worry about.
Load the Toph!
I'm gonna give us some cover! 
I can't just stand by and do nothing!
Aang! No! 
You're still hurt, and you have to stay secret. Just let us handle this.
Fine!
How we doing?
Things couldn't get much worse. 
The Universe just loves proving me wrong, doesn't it?
Thank you, The Universe!
Hey, Aang, we're going into town to find some dinner.
Well, I am pretty hungry. Maybe dinner's a good idea.
Here, tie this around your head. It'll cover your arrow.
I'm not going out if I can't wear my arrow proudly. 
Aang, be practical.
You guys go ahead without us. We'll catch up with you. 
I think I understand why being a secret bothers you so much.  You don't want people to think you failed.
You're right, I don't. But the problem is, I did fail.
Aang, that's not true.
It is true. I was in Ba Sing Se. I was there, but I lost. And now, the Earth Kingdom has fallen for good. 
Remember, there's still an invasion plan.
And I hate the invasion plan, too! I don't want you or anyone else risking your lives to fix my mistakes.  I've always known that I would have to face the Fire Lord, but now, I know I need to do it alone.
Aang.
Katara, please. Just go, please.
Is there anything you need? 
I need to redeem myself. I need my honor back.
I brought you some food. 
Oh no!
You have been away for a long time. I see the weight of your travels has changed you. You have redeemed yourself my son .
Welcome home.
I'll leave you two alone.
What's wrong Katara?
He left. 
What?
Aang. He just took his glider and disappeared. He has this ridiculous notion that he has to save the world alone. That it's all his responsibility. 
Maybe that's his way of being brave.
It's not brave. It's selfish and stupid. We could be helping him. And I know the world needs him, but doesn't he know how much that we need him too? How could he just leave us behind?
You're talking about me too, aren't you?
How could you leave us, Dad? I mean, I know we had Gran Gran, and she loved us, but...but we were just so lost without you.
I am so sorry, Katara. 
I understand why you left. I really do, and I know that you had to go, so why do I still feel this way? I was so sad and angry, and hurt.
I love you more than anything. You and your brother are my entire world. I thought about you every day I was gone, and every night when I went to sleep. I would lay awake missing you so much, it would ache.
I am proud of you, Prince Zuko. I am proud because your sister conquered Ba Sing Se. I am proud because, when your loyalty was tested by your treacherous uncle, you did the right thing, and captured the traitor. And I am proudest of all of your most legendary acco mplishment. You slayed the Avatar.
What did you hear?
Azula told me everything. She said she was amazed and impressed with your power and ferocity at the moment of truth.
Blockade.
Why'd you do it?
You're going to have to be a little more specific.
Why did you tell Father That I was the one who killed the Avatar?
Can't this wait until morning?
It can't
Fine. You seemed so worried about how father would treat you because you hadn't captured the Avatar. I figured, if I gave you the credit, you'd have nothing to worry about.
But why? 
Call it a generous gesture. I wanted to thank you for your help, and I was happy to share the glory. 
You're lying.
If you say so. 
You have another motive for doing this. I just haven't figure out what it is.
Please, Zuko. What ulterior motive could I have? What could I possibly gain by letting you get all the glory for defeating the Avatar? Unless somehow, the Avatar was actually alive. All that glory would suddenly turn to shame and foolishness. But you said yourself that was impossible. Sleep well, Zuzu.
I'm not gonna make it. I failed. 
Roku?
You haven't failed, Aang. 
But everyone thinks I am dead again. They think I've abandoned them, and I'm losing this war. I'm letting the whole world down. 
If anyone is to blame for the state of the world, it is me. I should've seen this war coming, and prevented it. You inherited my problems and my mistakes. But I also believe you are destined to redeem me, and save the world. 
I don't know.
You already saved the world. 
And you'll save the world again. But you can't give up.
You're right. I won't give up.
You're ok!
I have so much to do. 
I know, but you'll have our help.
You didn't think you could get out of training just by coming to the Fire Nation, did you?
What about the invasion?
We'll join up with my dad and the invasion force on the day of the eclipse. 
Hey, what's...  Oh...it's your glider.
That's okay. If someone saw it, it would give away my identity. It's better for now that no one knows I'm alive.
So, what kind of trouble is Katara in?
I don't know. In my vision, I just knew she needed help.
It would be nice if your Avatar powers could be just a little more specific from time to time. 
What is that?! 
Need a ride? 
Ahhh!
The Earth King and The Council of Five do not trust the Dai Li. They imprisoned your leader, Long Feng. Soon they will turn on all of you, and eliminate you. Seizing power today is a matter of life and death.  The coup must be swift and decisive. The Earth King, and each of the five generals, must be taken out simultaneously. Long Feng has placed you in me command while we overthrow the government.  If I sense any disloyalty, any hesitation, any weakness at all, I will snuff it out. That is all. 
Yeah, I thought you were gonna make that one guy pee his pants.
There are still a few loose ends. The Avatar, and my brother and Uncle.
Many times, I imagined myself here, at the threshold of the palace. But I always thought I would be here as a conqueror...instead, we are the Earth Kings personal guests, here to serve him tea. Destiny is a funny thing.
It sure is Uncle.
So how did it go with the Guru? Did you master the Avatar State?
Aang, are you ok?
I'm great. It went great with the Guru. I completely mastered the Avatar State. Heh heh...heh. Yeah.
What's taking so long? 
Maybe the Earth King overslept.
Something's not right. 
It's tea time.
Azula!
Have you met the Dai Li? They're Earthbenders, but they have a killer instinct that is so Firebender, I just love it!
Did I ever tell you how I got the nickname the "Dragon of the West"? 
I'm not interested in a lengthy anecdote, Uncle.
It's more of a demonstration really.
Come on. You'll be fine.
No. I'm tired of running. It's time I faced Azula!
You're so dramatic. What, are you going to do, challenge me to an Agni Kai?
Yes! I challenge you!
No thanks.
But, in my vision. I felt so sure that she was in trouble. 
See Aang? She's with Suki. They're probably back at our apartment right now, talking about make up or something.
Ok, maybe you're right.
Zuko!
Momo!
There's no one else here.
Katara is in trouble! I knew it!
Oh no.
Wait, someone's at the door.  Actually, I know who it is. It's an old friend of mine.   Glad to see you're okay.
I need your help.
You guys know each other!
I met him in the woods once and knocked him down. Then he gave me tea and very good advice.
May I come in?  Princess Azula is here in Ba Sing Se. 
She must have Katara.
She has captured my nephew as well.
Then we'll work together to fight Azula, and save Katara and Zuko. 
Woah there. You lost me at, "Zuko".
I know how you must feel about my nephew. But believe me when I tell you there is good inside him. 
Good inside of him isn't enough. Why don't you come back when it's outside him too, okay? 
Katara is in trouble. All of Ba Sing Se is in trouble. Working together is our best chance.
I brought someone along who might be able to help us.
My sister! Where are they keeping Katara? 
Why did they throw you in here? Oh wait. Let me guess. It's a trap. So when Aang shows up to rescue me, you can finally have him in your little Fire Nation clutches. 
You're a terrible person, you know that? Always following us, hunting the Avatar, trying to capture the world's last hope for peace! But what do you care? You're the Fire Lord's son. Spreading war and violence and hatred is in your blood. 
You don't know what you're talking about.
I don't?! How dare you! You have no idea what this war has put me through. Me personally . The Fire Nation took my mother away from me.
I'm sorry. That's something we have in common.
Well whaddya know. There is an ancient city down there, but it's deep.
We should split up. Aang, you go with Iroh to look for Katara and the angry jerk...no offense.
None taken.
And I'll go with Toph to warn the Earth King about Azula's coup.
So, Toph thinks you give pretty good advice. And great tea. 
The key to both is proper aging. What's on your mind?
Well, I met with this Guru who was supposed to help me master the Avatar State, and control this great power. But to do it, I had to let go of someone I love, and I just couldn't. 
Perfection and power are overrated. I think you were very wise to choose happiness and love.
What happens if we can't save everyone and beat Azula? Without the Avatar State, what if I am not powerful enough?
I don't know the answer. Sometimes life is like this dark tunnel. You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving... 
You will come to a better place.
There's General How!
The coup is happening right now! We've got to warn the Earth King!
Thank goodness we're in time!
Uh, I'm kinda involved with Suki.
They're not the real Kyoshi Warriors!
Sorry to disappoint you.
Get them all out of my sight.
It's because they haven't made up their minds. They're waiting to see how this is going to end.
I can see your whole history in your eyes. You were born with nothing. So you had to struggle and connive and claw your way to power. But true power...the divine right to rule...is something you're born with. The fact is, they don't know which one of us is going to be sitting on that throne and which one is going to be bowing down. But I know. And you know.   Well?
I'm sorry I yelled at you before.
It doesn't matter.
It's just that for so long now, whenever I would imagine the face of the enemy, it was your face.
My face. I see .
It's ok. I used to think this scar marked me. The mark of the banished prince, cursed to chase the Avatar forever. But lately, I've realized I'm free to determine my own destiny, even if I'll never be free of my mark. 
Maybe you could be free of it. 
What?
I have healing abilities.
It's a scar. It can't be healed.
This is water from the Spirit Oasis at the North Pole. It has special properties, so I have be saving it forsomething important.  I don't know if it would work, but...
Aang, I knew you would come.
Uncle, I don't understand. What are you doing with the Avatar!! 
Saving you, that's what.
Zuko, it's time we talked.  Go help your other friends. We'll catch up with you.
Why Uncle? 
You are not the man you used to be, Zuko. You are stronger and wiser and freer than you have ever been. And now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny. It's time for you to choose. It's time for you to choose good! 
I expected this kind of treachery from Uncle, but Zuko, Prince Zuko...you're a lot of things, but you're not a traitor, are you?
Release him immediately!
Why don't you let him decide, Uncle? I need you Zuko. I've plotted every move of this day. This glorious day in Fire Nation history. And the only way we win is together. At the end of this day, you will have your honor back. You will have your father's love. You will have everything you want. 
Zuko, I am begging you, look into your heart and see what it is that you truly want.
You are free to choose.
We've got to find Sokka and Toph.
See any Dai Li agents near by?
Nope. All clear. 
Let's go!
I thought you had changed!
I have changed.
That is a nice trick.
Just take the bear.
There's too many.
I 'm sorry Katara.
You've got to get out of here! I'll hold them off as long as I can!
We've done it Zuko. It's taken a hundred years, but the Fire Nation has conquered Ba Sing Se.
I betrayed Uncle.
No, he betrayed you. Zuko, when you return home, father will welcome you as a war hero.
But I don't have the Avatar. What if Father doesn't restore my honor?
He doesn't need to Zuko. Today, you restored your own honor.
Aren't airbender stories the best?
Was it realistic? Was that how it was back then?
I laugh at gravity all the time. Haha! Gravity. 
Jingle, jingle!
Sorry!
Aww. Cheapskates!
Hey thanks for the story!
Aw, much obliged little bat thing!
What are you prattling about child? Great grand-pappy saw the air walkers last week!
Hey, we're almost at the Northern Air Temple! This is where they had the championships for sky bison polo.
I'm saying you're an optimist. Same thing basically.
Hey guys, look at this!
Huh! They really are airbenders!
We better find some solid ground before it finds us!
Hey there! You're pretty good.
Yeh, I know. But I can do more than fancy gliding!
Wow! I don't think I can do that! But here's a good one...
What do you think?
Hey! You're a REAL airbender! You must be the Avatar! That's amazing! I, I, I've heard stories about you.
Wow! This glider chair is incredible!
If you think this is good, wait until you see the other stuff my Dad designed.
This place is unbelievable.
Yeh, it's great isn't it?
No, just unbelievable.
Aang used to come here a long time ago. I think he's a little shocked it's so... different.
So better!
I'm sure some parts of the temple are still the same.
It's nice to see even one part of the temple that isn't ruined.
Look out!
This is a sacred temple! You can't treat it this way. I've seen it when the monks were here. I know what it's supposed to be like.
Dad, he's the Avatar. He used to come here a hundred years ago.
Our gliders.
Nature knows where to stop.
You put spark powder in the candle!
Hey Aang, I want to show you something.
I just can't get over it. There's not a single thing that's the same.
You're right. They're kind of keepers of the temples origins.
Hey! It's just like the one in the other Air Temple.
Only an airbender can open it – so inside it's completely untouched, just the way the monks left it. I've always wondered what it was like in there.
Aang?
I completely understand. I just wanted you to know it was here.
Thanks.
These lanterns are terrible! I can't see.
Why would you want to use fireflies for light?
Okay, so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room.
What?
That's the something you're talking about.
Yeh, I suppose it is.
Are you ready?
No!
I can't believe I'm flying!
Just make sure to keep your mouth closed so you don't swallow a bug!
Teo was right about the air! All I had to do was trust it. Let it carry me.
Even though Teo's not an airbender, he really does have the spirit of one.
I've been thinking. If you wanna see what's in that room, I'd be happy to open the door for you.
Great!
I can't believe I'm finally going to see what's inside. 
How could something that's so small you can't even see it make such a big stink!
Yeh!
If we put a whole mess of rotten eggs in the cellar where the gas seeps up...
Then, if there's a leak...
And plug up the hole where the gas is escaping!
You're a genius!
This is a nightmare.
Explain all this! Now!
When are they coming?
You can't give them more weapons.
How can I be proud of you when your inventions are being used for murder?
We're not leaving!
You know better than to keep me waiting.  Give me what you owe us so I can be on my way.  Well?  Is there a problem?
The deal's off!
The Avatar!
This is bad! Very bad!
Aang, what are we gonna do? How can we possibly keep them all away?
I'll tell ya how.  We have something they don't.  Air power! We control the sky. That' something the Fire Nation can't do. We can win!
Thank you. You're a genius!
See, the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it airborne, but once you did, it just kept going.  You could put a hole in the top, but then all the hot air would escape. So the question became, how do you keep a lid on hot air?
A lid is actually the answer. If you control the hot air, you control the war balloon. 
Hmm. That's actually pretty smart.
Okay, we've got four kinds of bombs. Smoke, slime, fire and...
Are we ready?
Yes, but where's Sokka with the war balloon?
Take them out of the sky, now!
We've got'em on the run! We need more slime!
Those things are unstoppable!
I think I know how they work. I remember my Dad tinkering with the counterbalancing system. Something to do with water. Works great, huh?
Water? Can you get me close to one?
No problem!
We're out of bombs!
Come on, Sokka, where's that war balloon?
Hey, why aren't they shooting at us?
Oh no! That was the last one!
Rotten eggs!
There! That's where the gas is escaping!
It's the only bomb we've got!
Look! They're retreating!
Yeh!!!
We're going down!
No! Sokka! Hold on!
Get ready!
You know what? I'm really glad you guys all live here now. It's like the hermit crab , maybe you weren't born here, but you found this empty shell and made it your home. And now you protect each other.
That means a lot coming from you.
Aang, you were right about air power.  As long as we've got the skies we'll have the Fire Nation on the run!
This defeat is the gateway to many victories.
This should give us a good idea of what's around here.
I bet we'll find something to eat here! . The Fire Days Festival.  Fire Nation cultural exhibits...jugglers, benders, magicians. This'd be a great place for me to study some real firebenders!
Hey, a poster of me!
A wanted poster. This is bad.
I think we better keep moving.
I have to learn firebending at some point, and this could be my only chance to watch a master up close.
What!? You want to walk into a Fire Nation town where they're all fired up with all their, you know, fire?
We'll wear disguises and if it looks like trouble, we'll leave.
You guys stay out of sight here while we go to the festival.
Ready disguises!
Let's go.
I think we need some new disguises.
I'll take'em!
Aaahhh! Hot! Hot!
Aang, hold on! Where are we going?
I don't know, but there's a big crowd so it must be good.
Knowing the Fire Nation, it's probably an execution.
I gotta learn that trick!
What do you think you're doing?
I want to get a closer look.
It's better that we don't attract any attention to ourselves.
Awww, she's shy. Leeet's give her some encouragement, folks!
Awww! That could'a been me.
This next trick is called "Taming the Dragon."  You will be my captured princess!
Don't worry, young maiden! I will tame this fiery beast!  It's too strong, I can't hold it!
We gotta help her!
No, we don't want to make a scene!
The rope, it's breaking!
I think it's time to go.
There they are!
I'm calling Appa!
I hope he can really hear that bison whistle!
Appa! Down here!
Nice touch setting off the fireworks.
You seem to really know your explosives.
Was. My name's Chey.
I serve a man. More than a man really, he's a myth, but he's real, a living legend, Jeong Jeong the Deserter. He was a Fire Nation general, or wait, was he an admiral?
He was very highly ranked, we get it.
Yeh! Way up there! But he couldn't take the madness any more. He's the first person ever to leave the army - and live. I'm the second, but you don't get to be a legend for that. That's okay though. Jeong Jeong's a firebending genius. Some say he's mad - but he's not! He's enlightened.
You mean there's a firebender out here who's not with the Fire Lord?  We've gotta go see him! He can train me!
We're not gonna go find some crazy firebender!
That's what you said about going to the festival! Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me!?
Hold on, you know these guys!?
Oh yeh! Lin Yi's an old buddy! Right Lin Yi?
Oh that's okay, we can chat later.
Is that where Jeong Jeong is? I need to talk to him right away.
Don't worry! Everything'll be fine. He's a great man, great man!
So, the Avatar was here and you let slip away?
Yes, sir, but other than that the festival went off without a hitch!  No fights. Theft was way down.
I don't care about your local crime rates! Which way did they go?
What happened? Can I see Jeong Jeong now?
Why won't he see me?
He says you're not ready. Says you haven't mastered waterbending and earthbending yet.
Wait, how does he know that?
He saw the way you walked into camp. He can tell.
I'm going in anyway!
Master, I need to learn firebending.
Ookay, but it's the Avatar's duty to master all of the bending disciplines.
Please, I have to learn. This could be my only chance.
Really? That's great!
But what am I concentrating on?
Are we coming up here so I don't burn anything with my fire blasts?
You brought me up here to breathe?
You're not even look... 
I've been breathing for hours.
I thought about what you said. I promise I'll be more patient.
Oh yeh!
I mean, let us begin.
Master! There is trouble.
What's going on?
I'm sure there's a good reason.
But I'm ready to do so much more.
I did it! I made fire!
Careful!
Now that's firebending!
Aang, you'll hurt yourself!
Katara!  I'm so sorry! 
Iiiit was an accident! I was... Katara, I'm so -
I told you we shouldn't mess around with this! Look what you did! You burned my sister!
You burned my sister!  This is all your fault!
I'm sorry, I didn't...  I'm sorry!
But you're a great master. You have powers I'll never know.
Don't worry, men. My old teacher gave up fighting a long time ago.
Master Jeong Jeong.
Katara! Are you all right?
I'm fine, we've got to get out of here. Where's Aang?
Jeong Jeong tried to tell me that I wasn't ready. I wouldn't listen. I'm never going to firebend again.
You'll have to eventually.
No, never again.
It's okay, Aang. I'm healed.
What? How?
I'll explain later. But right now, we have to get out here. Zhao and his soldiers are attacking!
By the river. They captured Jeong Jeong.
Look at you. You were once so great. I can't believe my former master has become nothing more than a simple savage.
It's Admiral Zhao, now. 
We'll see. Men! Take the deserter!
YOU were Jeong Jeong's student?
Until I got bored.
I see he taught you how to duck and run like a coward. But I doubt he showed you what a firebender is truly capable of!
Whoa! Wild shot!
I'll show you wild!
Stand and fight, Avatar!
Oh, were we fighting? I thought you were just getting warmed up.
I was!
Is that all you got? Man, they'll make anyone an admiral these days!
Ahoy!  I'm Admiral Zhao!
I don't know why, but I thought you'd be better than Zuko.
Sloppy. Very sloppy.
No wonder to run now, you little smart mouth!
You've lost this battle.
Are you crazy? You haven't thrown a single blow!
Jeong Jeong said you had no restraint.
Have a nice walk home!
Wait! Where's Jeong Jeong?
He disappeared. They all did.
Hey, where did everybody go? Very funny guys!
Aang, you're burned.
Let me help you.
Wow! That's good water.
When did you learn how to do that?
Oh... well then thanks for all the first aid over the years. Like when I fell into the grease briar bramble and that time I had two fish hooks in my thumb!
Two?
He tried to get the first fish hook out with another fish hook.
Oh, and the time that big snake bit me! Thanks for healing that up. That was great. Really helpful.
Where's Momo?
Hang on Momo!
All right—you too.
This is gonna take forever.
That works...
These are Fire Nation traps—you can tell from the metalwork. We'd better pack up camp, and get moving.
Ah-ah...no flying this time.
What?
Why wouldn't we fly?
Think about it. Somehow Prince Zuko and the Fire Nation keep finding us. It's because they spot Appa—he's just too noticeable.
What! Appa's not too noticeable!
He's a gigantic fluffy monster with an arrow on his head—it's kinda hard to miss him!
Who made you the boss?
I'm not the boss—I'm the leader.
I'm the oldest and I'm a warrior.  So...I'm the leader!
If anyone's the leader, it's Aang. I mean, he is the Avatar.
Are you kidding—he's just a goofy kid!
He's right.
Why do boys always think someone has to be the leader? I bet you wouldn't be so bossy if you kissed a girl.
I-I've kissed a girl—you...just haven't met her.
Who? Gran-gran? I've met Gran-gran.
No—besides Gran-gran. Look, my instincts tell me we have a better chance of slipping through on foot and a leader has to trust his instincts.
Okay, we'll try it your way Oh Wise Leader.
Who knows—walking might be fun.
Walking stinks! How do people go anywhere without a flying bison?
I don't know Aang. Why don't you ask Sokka's instincts—they seem to know everything.
Ha ha. Very funny.
I'm tired of carrying this pack.
You know who you should ask to carry it for a while? Sokka's Instincts!
That's a great idea! Hey, Sokka's Instincts, would you mind—
Okay, okay—I get it. Look guys, I'm tired too. But the important thing is that--  --we're safe from...the—  --Fire...Nation...
RUN!
We're cut off! 
Sokka, your shirt!
If you let us pass, we promise not to hurt you.
Bluffing?
You? Promise not to hurt us?
Nice work, Sokka! How'd ya do that?
Uh...instinct?
Look!
Down you go.
They're in the trees!
Hey, he was mine!
Gotta be quicker next time.
Hi.
Army? Pfft. There were only, like, twenty guys!
My name is Jet, and these are my Freedom Fighters. Sneers--  --Longshot  --Smellerbee  --The Duke and Pipsqueak. 
You think my name is funny?
It's hilarious.
Um...thanks for saving us Jet. We were lucky you were there.
I should be thanking you. We were waiting to ambush those soldiers all morning—we just needed the right distraction. And then you guys stumbled in.
We were relying on instincts.
You'll get yourself killed doing that.
That's a great score.
And these boxes are filled with jelly candy!
Also good. Let's not get those mixed up.
We'll take the stuff back to the hideout.
You guys have a hideout?
You wanna see it?
Yes we wanna see it!
We're here.
Where...there's nothing here!
Hold this.
Why...what's this do?
Woah!
Aang?
I'll get up on my own.
Grab hold of me Katara.
Nice place you got!
It's beautiful up here!
It's beautiful...and more importantly the Fire Nation can't find us.
They would love to find you. Wouldn't they, Jet?
It's not gonna happen, Smellerbee.
Why does the Fire Nation want to find you?
I guess you could say I've been causing them a little trouble. See, they took over a nearby Earth Kingdom town a few years back.
We've been ambushin' their troops, cutting off their supply lines, and doing anything we can to mess with ‘em.
One day, we'll drive the Fire Nation out of here for good and free that town.
That's so brave.
Don't pay any attention to my brother.
No problem. He probably had a rough day.
So, you all live here?
That's right. Longshot over there?  His town got burned down by the fire Nation. And we found the Duke trying to steal our food. I don't think he ever really had a home.
What about you?
Fire Nation killed my parents. I was only eight years old. That day changed me forever.
Sokka and I lost our mother to the Fire Nation.
I'm so sorry, Katara.
Today, we struck another blow against the Fire Nation swine.
I got a special joy from the look on one soldier's face, when the Duke dropped down on his helmet and rode him like a wild hog monkey.
Now, the Fire Nation thinks they don't have to worry about a couple of kids hiding in the trees.  Maybe they're right.
Or maybe...they are dead wrong.
Hey Jet, nice speech.
Thanks. By the way, I was really impressed with you and Aang. That was some great bending I saw out there today.
Well, he's great. He's the Avatar. I could use some more training. 
Avatar huh? Very nice.
Thanks Jet.
So I might know a way that you and Aang can help in our struggle.
Unfortunately we have to leave tonight. 
Sokka, you're kidding me! I needed you on an important mission tomorrow.
What mission?
What are you doing?
Shh...it amplifies vibrations.
Nothing yet.  Wait! Yes, someone's approaching.
I think there's just one.
Good work, Sokka. Ready your weapon.
What are you doing in our woods, you leech.
Do you like destroying towns? Do you like destroying families? Do you?!
Does the Fire Nation let people go?! Does the Fire Nation have mercy?!
Jet, he's just an old man!
He's Fire Nation! Search him!
But he's not hurting anyone!
Have you forgotten that the Fire Nation killed your mother? Remember why you fight!
We've got his stuff, Jet. 
This doesn't feel right.
It's what has to be done—now let's get outta here.
Come on Sokka!
Sokka! Look what the Duke gave me!
Ow! Quit it!
Hey Sokka. Is Jet back?
Yeah—he's back. But we're leaving.
What?
But I made him this hat.
Your boyfriend Jet's a thug.
What? No, he's not.
He's messed up Katara.
He's not messed up, he's just got a different way of life—a really fun way of life.
He beat and robbed a harmless old man!
I wanna hear Jet's side of the story.
Sokka—you told them what happened but you didn't mention that the guy was Fire Nation?
No, he conveniently left that part out.
Fine! But even if he was Fire Nation, he was a harmless civilian
He was an assassin, Sokka.
See? There's a compartment for poison in the knife. . He was sent to eliminate me—you helped save my life, Sokka.
I knew there was an explanation
I didn't see any knife!
That's because he was concealing it.
See Sokka? I'm sure you just didn't notice the knife.
There was no knife! I'm going back to the hut and packing my things. 
Tell me you guys aren't leaving yet. I really need your help.
What can we do?
The Fire Nation is planning on burning down our forest. If you both use water bending to fill the reservoir, we could fight the fires. But if you leave now, they'll destroy the whole valley.
We can't leave now with the Fire Nation about to burn down a forest!
I'm sorry Katara. Jet's very smooth, but we can't trust him.
You know what I think? You're jealous that he's a better warrior and a better leader!
Katara, I'm not jealous of Jet. It's just that my instinct—
Well my instincts tell me we need to stay here a little longer and help Jet. Come on Aang.
Sorry Sokka.
Let's go.
Now listen—you are not to blow the dam until I give the signal. If the reservoir isn't full, the Fire Nation troops could survive.
But what about the people in the town—won't they get wiped out too?
Look Duke, that's the price of ridding this area of the Fire Nation. : Now don't blow the dam until I give the signal—got it?
Sokka. I'm glad you decided to join us.
I heard your plan to destroy the Earth Kingdom town.
Our plan is to rid the valley of the Fire Nation.
There are people living there Jet—mothers and fathers and children.
We can't win without making some sacrifices.
You lied to Aang and Katara about the forest fire!
Because they don't understand the demands of war. Not like you and I do.
I do understand. I understand that there's nothing you won't do to get what you want.
I was hoping you'd have an open mind, but I can see you've made your choice.
I can't let you warn Katara and Aang.  Take him for a walk--a long walk.
You can't do this!
Cheer up, Sokka. We're gonna win a great victory against the Fire Nation today.
Jet—I'm sorry about how Sokka's been acting. 
No worries—he already apologized. 
Really?  Sokka apologized?
Yeah—I was surprised too. I got the sense that maybe you talked to him or something.
Yeah, I did.
I guess something you said got through to him. Anyhow, he went out on a scouting mission with Pipsqueak and Smellerbee.
I'm glad he cooled off. He's so stubborn sometimes.
All right, we're here. Underground water's trying to escape through these vents. I need you guys to help it along.
...I've never used bending on water I can't see. I don't know...
Katara. You can do this.
I know the Avatar can do this.
Yes! Good job! This river empties into the reservoir--a few more geysers and it'll be full.
Look, there's another steam vent.
Okay. You two keep it up—I'll go check on things at the reservoir. 
When we're done we'll meet you over there.
Actually...probably better if you meet me back at the hideout when you're done.
...I bet that's enough—and I'm not just saying that to be lazy.
Let's catch up with Jet at the reservoir.
I thought we agreed to meet Jet back at the hideout. 
Well, we finished early--I'm sure he'll be happy to see us.
Come on—move along!
How can you stand by and do nothing while Jet wipes out a whole town?
Hey listen Sokka, Jet's a great leader. We follow what he says, and things always turn out okay.
If that's how Jet leads, then he's got a lot to learn.
Hey!
While you two are up there you might want to practice your knot-work. 
Hey Smellerbee—you gonna eat your leechee nuts?  Ooh. 
...What are they doing?
Hey, those are the red barrels he got from the Fire Nation.
Why would they need blasting jelly?
Because Jet's gonna blow up the dam.
What? No--that would destroy the town. Jet wouldn't do that.
I've gotta stop him. 
Yes I would.
Jet—why?
Katara, you would too if you just stopped to think. Think about what the Fire Nation did to your mother—we can't let them do that to anyone else, ever again.
This isn't the answer!
I want you to understand me Katara. I thought your brother would understand, but—
Where's Sokka?
Katara.
I need to get to the dam.
You're not going anywhere without your glider.
I'm not gonna fight you, Jet.
You'll have to if you want your glider back.
Why, Jet? I can't believe I trusted you. You lied to me—you're sick and I trusted you!
What are you doing?
You're too late.
Sokka's still out there—he's our only chance.
Come on, Sokka. I'm sorry I ever doubted you. Please.
Sokka didn't make it in time.
All those people... Jet—you monster!
This was a victory, Katara. Remember that. The Fire Nation is gone and this valley will be safe.
It will be safe—without you.
Sokka!
I warned the villagers of your plan, just in time.
What!
At first they didn't believe me. The Fire Nation soldiers assumed I was a spy. But one man vouched for me—the old man you attacked. He urged them to trust me, and we got everyone out in time.
Sokka, you fool! We could've freed this valley!
Who would be free—everyone would be dead.
You traitor!
No, Jet. You became the traitor when you stopped protecting innocent people.
Katara. Please—help me.
Goodbye Jet.
Yip yip.
We thought you were going to the dam. How come you went to the town instead?
Lemme guess—your instincts told you.
Hey—sometimes they're right.
Um...Sokka? You know we're going the wrong way, right?
...And sometimes they're wrong. 
Hey look! A sword made out of a whale's tooth.
This is a water tribe weapon.  See if you can find anything else.
: No, we found something.
It's burned. 
There was a battle. Water tribe warriors ambushed a group of firebenders. 
The firebenders fought back, but the warriors drove them down this hill...
So then what happened?
I don't know. The trail ends here.
Is this... Dad's boat?
Ahh! See, Prince Zuko, a moment of quiet is good for your mental well being. 
Get back! We're after a stowaway.
There are no stowaways on my ship.
He's paralyzed.
But how did you find him on my ship?
Sokka...
I'm coming with you.
You're not old enough to go to war, Sokka, you know that.
Someday you will.  I'm going to miss you so much.
Who's there?
Sokka?
Bato? 
Bato!
Sokka! Katara!  It is so good to see you two! Oh, you've grown so much.
Where's Dad?
Is he here?
No, he and the other warriors should be in the eastern Earth Kingdom by now.
Brr! This is no place for a reunion. Let's get inside.
After I was wounded, your father carried me to this abbey. The sisters have cared for me ever since.  Superior, these are Hakoda's children. They've been traveling with the Avatar. I found them by my boat.
The sisters craft ointments and perfumes.
Perfume? Maybe we could dump some on Appa? Because he stinks so much! Am I right?
You have your father's wit.
Bato! It looks like home!
Everything's here, even the pelts!
Yeh, nothing's more comforting than dead animal skins.
No way! Stewed sea prunes?
Help yourself.
Dad could eat a whole barrel of these things.
Bato, is it true you and Dad lassoed an arctic hippo?
It was your father's idea. He just dragged me along. Well, the hippo did the dragging.
Hey, I ride animals too! One time there was this giant eel –
Everyone does.
What's that story?
It's a long one, Aang, some other time.
You and Dad had so many hilarious adventures.
Not all of which were hilarious at the time, but everything's funny with hindsight.  Aang, put that down , it's ceremonial and very fragile.
Was it you or Dad that put an octopus on your head and convinced Gran-Gran you were a water spirit?
Your dad wore the octopus, but  I did the spooky voice.
Out of my way! Step aside, filth!
He means no offense! I'm sure you bathe regularly.
I need to talk to you.
Well, if it isn't my new friends, Angry Boy and Uncle Lazy.
Your beast trashed my ship. You have to pay me back.
What happened? Your girlfriend run off on you?
It's not the girl I'm after, it's the bald monk she's traveling with.
Whatever you say.
If you find them, I'll consider the damage to my ship paid for.
Heh! Forget it.
Plus we'll pay your weight in gold.
Make it your weight and we got a deal.
There's something I should tell you kids. I'm expecting a message from your father. 
Really?
When?
Any day now. Your father said he'd send a message when they found the rendezvous point. If you wait here until the message arrives you can come with me and see your father again.
It's been over two years since we've seen Dad! That would be so incredible. Katara?
I do really miss him. It would be great to see Dad.
It's been far too long, hasn't it? I'm not sure when word will arrive, but when it does...
Even if we had time to wait for the message, who knows how far we'd have to travel. We don't have time for a long detour.
I'm sure your father would understand and be proud that his children are helping the Avatar.
I can't believe they would leave me.
I'm looking for Bato of the Water Tribe.
Uh, I know Bato.
It's the map to Sokka and Katara's Dad!
Hey everyone! Sorry I was gone so long.
Hey Aang, I didn't notice you left.
We're looking for someone.
I hope it's not Miyuki.  Miyuki, did you get in trouble with the Fire Nation again?
The Avatar's been through here. Let's keep moving.
This ship is sentimental to me. It was built by my father.
Is this the boat he took you ice-dodging in?
Yeh, it's got the scar to prove it. Huh. How about you, Sokka? You must have some good stories from your first time ice-dodging?
He never got to go. Dad left before he was old enough.
Oh, I forgot, you were too young.
What's ice-dodging?
It's a rite of passage for young water tribe members. When you turn fourteen your Dad takes you... you know what , you're about to find out.
Why are we stopping?
Because the girl must of spent a lot of time here.
Hey, watch it!
Oh look, he likes you.
Ice-dodging is a ceremonial test of wisdom, bravery and trust. In our village it was done by weaving a boat through a field of icebergs.
How are we supposed to ice-dodge without ice?
You will be dodging...those.
Sokka, you steer and call the shots. Lead wisely. Katara, you secure the mainsail. The winds can be brutal, so be brave. Aang, you control the jib, without your steady hand we all go down. Your position is about trust.
For this to be done right I cannot help. You pass or fail on your own.
Aang, ease up on the jib. Katara, steady! Aang, less sail!  Katara, give him room!
Aang! Helm to lee! Helm to lee!
What does that even mean!?
Great job!
There's no way through!
We can make it!
Sokka, you've already proven yourself, maybe we should –
Aang, I'm gonna need air in that sail!  Katara, I want you to bend as much water as you can between us and those rocks!  Now!
The spirits of water bear witness to these marks. For Sokka, the mark of the wise, the same mark your father earned.
For Katara, the mark of the brave. Your courage inspires us.
And for Aang, the mark of the trusted. You are now an honorary member of the water tribe.
I can't.
Of course you can!
Aang, what are you talking about.
Now Sokka, I think you should – 
Katara, are you with me?
Good luck.
Okay. You too.
Guess I should be moving on.
That would be best.
I'm an idiot, Momo.
We're getting close.
That wolf sounds so sad.
It's probably wounded.
No, it's been separated from the pack. I understand that pain. It's how I felt when the water tribe warriors had to leave me behind. They were my family and being apart from them was more painful than my wounds.
Sokka?
Thanks, Bato.
I know where to go from here. . Take this in case you want to find us. I'll leave a message at the rendezvous point.
Looks like we're going alone, guys.
Avatar! You must leave!
Okay, I get it. Everybody wants me gone.
A group of people came to the abbey looking for you.
A fierce looking woman with a horrible monster and a young man with a scar.
Zuko!
The beast was using the scent of a necklace to follow you.
A necklace?  Huh! Katara!
So this is your girlfriend.  No wonder she left. She's way too pretty for you.
Where is he? Where's the Avatar?
How stupid do you think I am?
Pretty stupid.  Run!
What are we supposed to do now?
It's seeking a different scent – perhaps something that the Avatar held.
What's it doing? It's just going around in a circle!
Aang!
I'm starting to get some feeling back!  Ow!
You've got something I want! 
That thing sees with its nose. Let's give him something to look at.
The perfume?
June! Noooo!
Uncle? I didn't see you get hit with the tongue.
Shh!
So, where do we go?
We're getting you to the North Pole.
Yeh, we've lost too much time as it is.
Don't you want to see your father?
Of course we do, Aang. But, you're our family too, and right now, you need us more.
And we need you.
I wish I could give you a little piece of home, Katara. Something to remind you –
I'll be okay.
Still, just a little trinket. Maybe something like...this!
Sure!
Colonel Shinu, please reconsider. Their precision is legendary. The Yu Yan can pin a fly to a tree from a hundred yards away – without killing it. You're wasting their talents using them as mere security guards.
But my search for the Avatar is –
But –
News from Fire Lord Ozai?  It appears I've been promoted to Admiral. My request is now an order. 
This should bring your fever down.
That's nice. I'll tell him.
Haha! Classic Appa.
Not so good. Being out in that storm really did a number on him. 
I couldn't find any ginger root for the tea, but I found a map.
There's an herbalist institute on the top of that mountain. We could probably find a cure for Sokka there.
Aang, he's in no condition to travel. Sokka just needs more rest. I'm sure he'll be better by tomorrow.
Not you too!
Relax, it was just a little cough. I'm fine –
That's how Sokka started yesterday. Now look at him – he thinks he's an earthbender!
A few more hours and you'll be talking nonsense too.  I'm going to find some medicine.
Uh, maybe it's safer if I go on foot.  Keep an eye on'em guys.
What do they want?
The hunt for the Avatar has been given prime importance.  All information regarding the Avatar must be reported directly to Admiral Zhao.
Admiral Zhao is not allowing ships in or out of this area.
Excellent! ake the pot. But, you're all improving. I'm certain you will win if we play again.
Katara... please... water...
Listen carefully, Momo. I need you to take this to the river and fill it with water.
Got it?
That's nice.
Wounded Earth Kingdom troops still come by now and again, brave boys, and thanks to my remedies they always leave in better shape they when they arrive.
That's nice. Are you almost done?
Hold on, I just need to add one last ingredient.  Oh, sandalwood... oh, er, uh, that won't do, banana leaf? Ah, nope, uh, ginger root, uh uh, oh where is that pesky little plant?
Is everything okay? It's been almost an hour and you haven't given the men an order.
I don't care what they do. 
Don't give up hope yet. You can still find the Avatar before Zhao.
Here's what I was looking for! Plum blossom!
Finally!
Thanks for all your help!
Ahaha! This isn't a cure, it's Miyuki's dinner.
Plum blossom is her favorite.
What about my friends?
Well, all they need is some frozen wood frogs. There's plenty of them down in the valley swamp.
What am I supposed to do with frozen frogs?
Why, suck on them of course!
The frog's skin excretes a substance that'll cure your friends, but make sure you get plenty. Once those little critters thaw out, they're useless!
You're insane aren't you?
Thaaat's right.  Well, don't stand there all day.  Go!
Uhh, I think you dropped this.
A frog!
So this is the great Avatar? Master of all the elements. I don't know how you've managed to elude the Fire Nation for a hundred years, but your little game of hide and seek is over.
I've never hidden from you. Untie me and I'll fight you right now!
Uhh, no. Tell me, how does it feel to be the only airbender left?  Do you miss your people?  Oh, don't worry, you won't be killed like they were.  See, if you die you'll just be reborn and the Fire Nation will have to being its search for the Avatar all over again. So, I'll keep you alive – but just barely.
Blow all the wind you want! Your situation is futile. There is no escaping this fortress – and no one is coming to rescue you.
Water...
Momo should be back any minute.
Ugh! No, Momo, water. Wa-ter!  Aang, what in the world is taking you so long?
All clear.
All clear. Go on in.
We are the sons and daughters of fire! The superior element! Until today, only one thing stood in our path to victory. The Avatar! I am here to tell you that he is now my prisoner!  This is the year Sozen's comet returns to grant us its power!  This is the year the Fire Nation breaks through the walls of Ba-Sing-Se and burns the city to the ground!
What? No! Don't leave frogs! My friends are sick and they need you! Please go back to being frozen!
Who are you? What's going on? Are you here to rescue me?  I'll take that as a "yes."
My frogs! Come back! And stop thawing out!  Wait! My friends need to suck on those frogs!
I want a full transcription of my speech sent to the Fire Lord, along with glowing testimonials from all of the ranking officers present, and – 
Sir, should I hold off sending that speech to the Fire Lord?
There, on the wall!
Stay close to me!
Here, take this. Jump on my back!
Gimme the next one!
Admiral, what are you doing?
Let them out, now!
How could you let them go?
A situation like this requires... precision.
Do you have a clear shot?
Knock out the thief. I'll deliver him to the Fire Lord along with the Avatar.
Quick! Recover the Avatar!
Where have you been, Prince Zuko? You missed music night! Lieutenant Jee sang a stirring love song.
Suck on these. They'll make you feel better.
No, I don't think I did.
Mmmm! This is tasty! Mmm!
Great, you're back! What's for dinner?
We've got a few options. First, round nuts and some kind of oval shaped nuts, and some rock shaped nuts that... might just be rocks. Dig in!
Seriously, what else ya got?
What was that!?
It's coming from over there!
Shouldn't we run away from huge booms – not toward them?
An earthbender!
Let's go meet him!
He looks dangerous, so we better approach cautiously.
Hello there, I'm Katara! What's your name?
Nice to meet you!
We just wanted to say “hi”.
Hey, that guy's gotta be running somewhere, maybe we're near a village and I bet that village has a market!
Hey! I worked hard to get those nuts!  Yeh, I hate'em too.
Great hat. I'll trade you some nuts for it.
Hey!
Hi, mom.
Where have you been, Haru? You're late! Get started on your chores.
Hey, you're that kid! Why did you run away before?
Uh, you must have me confused with some other kid.
No she doesn't, we saw you earthbending.
They're crazy, mom, I mean, look at how they're dressed!
You know how dangerous that is! You know what would happen if they caught you earthbending!
Fire Nation! Act natural!
What do you want? I've already paid you this week.
The tax just doubled. Wouldn't want an accident, would we?
Fire is sometimes so hard to control.
You can keep the copper ones.
Nice guy. How long has the Fire Nation been here?
Five years. Fire Lord Ozai uses our town's coal mines to fuel his ships.
They're thugs; they steal from us, and everyone here is too much of a coward to do anything about it.
Quiet, Haru. Don't talk like that.
But, Haru's an earthbender, he can help.
Earthbending is forbidden. It's caused nothing but misery for this village. He must never use his abilities.
How can you say that? Haru has a gift. Asking him not to earthbend is like asking me not to waterbend. It's a part of who we are.
You don't understand.
I understand that Haru can help you fight back. What can the Fire Nation do to you that they haven't done already?
They could take Haru away! Like they took his father.
My mom said you can sleep here tonight, but you should leave in the morning.
Thanks. I'll make sure Appa doesn't eat all your hay.
I'm sorry about what I said earlier. I didn't know about your father.
That's ok. It's funny, the way you were talking back in the store, it reminded me of him.
thanks.
My father was very courageous. When the Fire Nation invaded, he and the other earthbenders were outnumbered ten to one, but they fought back anyway.
He sounds like a great man.
After the attack, they rounded up my father every other earthbender and took them away. We haven't seen them since.
So, that's why you hide your earthbending?
Yeh. The problem is that the only way I can feel close to my father now is when I practice my bending. He taught me everything I know.
See this necklace? My mother gave it to me.
It's beautiful.
I lost my mother in a Fire Nation raid. This necklace is all I have left of her.
It's not enough, is it?
No.
The mine!
: It's not working, we have to get help.
There's no time – pull harder.
Haru, there's a way you can help him.
I can't.
Please, there's no one around to see you, it's the only way.
Haru, you did it!
It was so brave of Haru to use his earthbending to help that old man.
You must have really inspired him.
I guess so.
Everyone should get some sleep. We're leaving at dawn.
Dawn? Can't we sleep in for once?
Absolutely not! This village is crawling with Fire Nation troops. If they discover you're here, Aang, we'll be eating fireballs for breakfast. Good night.
Good night.
They took him! They took Haru away!
What?
The old man turned him in to the Fire Nation. It's all my fault, I forced him into earthbending.
Slow down, Katara, when did this happen?
Haru's mother said they came for him at midnight.
We don't need to track him. The Fire Nation is going to take me right to Haru.
...and why would they do that?
I thought you were crazy at first, Katara, but this might work. There are ventilation shafts throughout these mines, all Aang has to do is send an air current from that vent to this one right here. The boulder levitates and – tada! Fake earthbending.
Aang. Did you get all that?
Sure, I got it.
Do you remember your cue?
Yeh, yeh, just relax. You're taking all the fun out of this.
By “this” do you mean intentionally getting captured by an army of ruthless firebenders?
Exactly! That's fun stuff.
Here they come! Get in your places!
What did you call me?
A giant-eared cretin! Look at those things.  Do herds of animals use them for shade?
You better back off!  Seriously – back off.
I will not back off! I bet elephants get together and make fun of how large your ears are!
That's it – you're going down!
I'll show you who's boss – earthbending style!
I said, “earthbending style!”
No, you idiot! It's the girl!
Momo, you have some big ears!
She'll be fine, Aang, Katara knows what she's doing.
Earthbenders, it is my pleasure to welcome you aboard my modest shipyard. I am your warden. I prefer to think of you not as prisoners, but as honored guests, and I hope you come to think of me as your humble and caring host. You will succeed here if you simply abide –
What are you doing here?
It's my fault you were captured. I came to rescue you.
So, you got yourself arrested?
It was the only way to find you.
Katara, this is my father, Tyro. Dad, this is Katara.
It's not as bad as it looks.
Tyro, the prisoners are complaining there aren't enough blankets to go around.
I'll talk to the guards. In the meantime, make sure the elderly are taken care of. The rest of us will simply have to hope for warmer weather.
If you don't mind me asking, what's your escape plan?
You know, the plan to get everyone off the rig? What is it? Mutiny? Sabotage?
The plan? The plan is to survive - wait out this war. Hope that one day some of us can get back home and forget this ever happened.
How can you say that? You sound like you've already given up.
Katara, I admire your courage and I envy your youth, but people's lives are at stake here. The Warden is a ruthless man, and he won't stand for any rebellion. I'm sorry, but we're powerless.
Earthbenders! You don't know me, but I know of you. Every child of my water tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave Earth Kingdom and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders.  Some of you may think that the Fire Nation has made you powerless. Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend, but they can't take away your courage and it is your courage they should truly fear! Because it runs deeper than any mine you've been forced to dig, any ocean that keeps you far from home. It is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are, hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away. The time to fight back is now! I can tell you the Avatar has returned! So remember your courage, earthbenders, let us fight for our freedom!
Your 12 hours are up, where's Haru? We've got to get out of here.
I can't.
We don't have much time, there are guards everywhere. Get on.
Katara, what's wrong?
What do you mean you're not leaving!?
We can't abandon these people. There has to be a way to help them.
Maybe she's right. What do you say, Sokka?
I say you're both crazy!  Last chance, we need to leave – now!
No.
Look!
Tell me exactly what you saw.
Well, Sir, it looked like a flying bison.
What?
Which was it? A buffalo or a bison?
Uh, I'm not sure what the difference is, but that's not really the point is it, Sir?
You! Wake up the Captain. Search the entire rig!
Sir?
What!?
That...was the Captain you just threw overboard, so...
Then wake up someone I haven't thrown overboard and search the rig! There's something going on here and I don't like it.
We don't have much time. What are we gonna do?
I wish I knew how to make a hurricane.  The Warden would run away and we'd steal his keys!
Wouldn't he just take his keys with him?
I'm just tossing ideas around.
I tired talking the earthbenders into fighting back, but it didn't work. If there was just a way to help them help themselves.
For that they'd need some kind of earth, or some rock... something they can bend.
It's almost dawn, we're running out of time! Are you sure this is gonna work?
It should. These vents reminded me of our little trick back at the village. We're gonna do the same thing, but on a much bigger scale. 
There's a huge deposit of coal at the base of the silo, and the whole system is ventilated. Aang closed off all the vents except one. When he does his airbending, the coal only has one place to go – right back here.
There's the intruder!
Katara stop! You can't win this fight!
Listen to him well, child. You're one mistake away from dying where you stand.
Here's your chance, earthbenders!  Take it! Your fate is in your own hands!
Hahaha! Foolish girl! You thought a few inspirational words and some coal would change these people? Look at these blank, hopeless faces.  There spirits were broken a long time ago. Oh? But you still believe in them?  How sweet. They're a waste of your energy, little girl. You've failed.
Show no mercy!
For the Earth Kingdom, attack!
Get to the ship! We'll hold them off!
Do not let them escape!
Guys, throw me some coal!
No, please! I can't swim!
Don't worry, I hear cowards float.
I want to thank you for saving me. For saving us.
It wasn't the coal, Katara, it was you.
So, I guess you're going home now?
Yes, to take back my village.  To take back ALL of our villages! The Fire Nation will regret the day they set foot on our land!
Come with us.
I can't. Your mission is to take back your home. Ours is to get Aang to the North Pole.
That's him, isn't it? The Avatar. Katara, thank you for bringing my father back to me. I never thought I'd see him again. I only wish there was some way...
I know.  My mother's necklace! It's gone!
Maybe you should give it a try.
You're hilarious.
I'll try it! Yehhhh!
Turns out clouds are made of water!
Hey, what is that?
It's like a scar.
Listen, it's so quiet. There's no life anywhere.
Aang, are you ok?
Fire Nation! Those evil savages make me sick! They have no respect for – 
Shh!
Why would anyone do this? How could I let this happen?
Aang, you didn't let this happen. It has nothing to do with you.
Yes it does. It's the Avatar's job to protect nature. But, I don't know how to do my job.
That's why we're going to the North Pole to find you a teacher. 
Yeh, a waterbending teacher, but there's no one who can teach me how to be the Avatar. Monk Gyatso said that Avatar Roku would help me.
The Avatar before you? He died over a hundred years ago, how are you supposed to talk to him?
I don't know.
Uncle? We need to move on, we're closing in on the Avatar's trail and I don't want to lose him!
You look tired, Prince Zuko. Why don't you join me in these hot springs and soak away your troubles.
You should take your teacher's advice and relax a little. The temperature's just right. I heated it myself.
Enough! We need to leave now! Get out of the water!
On second thought, why don't you take another few minutes, but be back at the ship in half an hour or I'm leaving without you.
Hey Aang, are you ready to be cheered up?
No.
Ow!
Hey, how was that cheering me up?
Hehe, cheered me up.
Ow! Yeh, I probably deserved that.
These acorns are everywhere, Aang. That means the forest will grow back. Every one of these will be a tall oak tree someday, and all the birds and animals that lived here will come back. 
Hey, who are you?
So the rumors of your return are true.  It is the greatest honor of a lifetime to be in your presence.
Why is it attacking you?
What happens then?
Hei-Bai is already causing devastation and destruction. Once the solstice is here there is no telling what will happen.
So, what do you want me to do exactly?
Hey, ‘great bridge guy', can I talk to you over here for a second?
Aang, you seem a little unsure about all this.
Yeh, that might be because I don't know anything at all about the spirit world.  It's not like there's someone to teach me this stuff!
So, can you help these people?
I have to try, don't I? Maybe whatever I have to do will just... come to me.
I think you can do it, Aang.
Yehhh, we're all gonna get eaten by a spirit monster.
Uh? Who's there?
A meadow vole! I should have known. You startled me, little one.  Ehh, seems I've dozed off and missed my nephew's deadline, but it was a very sweet nap.
He's a Fire Nation soldier.
He's no ordinary soldier. This is the Fire Lord's brother, the Dragon of the West, the once great General Iroh, but now, he's our prisoner.
Hello? Spirit, can you hear me? This is the Avatar speaking. I'm... here to try to help stuff.
This isn't right. We can't sit here and cower while Aang waits for some monster to show up.
He still shouldn't have to face this alone.
Okay. Well, I guess that's settled then.
You must be the Hei-Bai spirit.  My name is...
My name is Aang! I'm the Avatar and I would like to help! Hey, wait up!
Uh...
The Avatar's methods are...  unusual.
It doesn't seem too interested in what he's saying. Maybe we should go help him?
Aang will figure out the right thing to do, Sokka.
Please, would you stop destroying things and listen? 
I'm just trying to do my job as spirit bridge. Excuse me, would you please turn around? I command you to turn around now!
That's it! He needs help! 
Sokka wait!
Hei-Bai! Over here!
Sokka, go back!
We'll fight him together, Aang.
I don't wanna fight him unless I – huh!
Sokka!
Uncle! Uncle, where are you?
Sir, maybe he thought you left without him?
Something's not right here.  That pile of rocks...
It looks like there's been a landslide, sir.
Land doesn't slide uphill. Those rocks didn't move naturally. My uncle's been captured by earthbenders!
Aang, over here!
Help!
Hang on, Sokka!
Sokka!  I failed.
Where are you taking me?
We're taking you to face justice.
Right. But where, specifically?
A place you're quite familiar with, actually. You once laid siege to it for 600 days, but it would not yield to you.
It was greater than you were, apparently.
I know.
Katara, Katara I lost him.
What? No, I'm right here! Grrr!!!
I'm in the spirit world!
Yup, that's Uncle Iroh.
Appa! Hey buddy, I'm right here. But, I guess you can't see me either.
It's ok, Appa. I'm sure they're on their way back. I bet they even found you a bunch of moon peaches for a treat.
What am I supposed to do?
Sokka?
That's definitely not Sokka!
What? I can't airbend in the spirit world!
You don't know where Sokka is, do you?
You're Avatar Roku's animal guide! Like Appa is to me. I need to save my friend and I don't know how. Is there some way for me to talk to Roku?
I'll be back Katara.  Take me to Roku!
What's the problem?
Nothing. Actually, there is a bit of a problem. My old joints are feeling sore and achy and these shackles are too loose.
Too loose?
That's right. The cuffs are loose and they jangle around and bump my wrists. It would help me if you would tighten them so they wouldn't shake around so much.
Very well. Corporal, tighten the prisoner's hand cuffs.
Hey, what are you doing!? Ahhhh!!! 
I don't understand. This is just a statue of Roku.
Is that what Roku wants to talk to me about? A comet? When can I talk to him?
It's a calendar, and the light will reach Roku on the solstice!  So, that's when I'll be able to speak to Roku?  But I can't wait that long. I need to save Sokka now.
He is too dangerous, Captain. We can't just carry him to the capital. We have to do something now.
I agree. He must be dealt with immediately and severely.
It's no use, Appa. I don't see them anywhere. Our best hope is to go back to the village and wait.
The Avatar!
You're back! Where's Sokka?
These dangerous hands must be crushed.
Excellent form, Prince Zuko.
You taught me well.
Surrender yourselves, it's five against two. You're clearly outnumbered.
Uh, that's true, but you are clearly outmatched!
Now would you please put on some clothes!
Aang, what are you doing? Run!
You're the spirit of this forest. Now I understand. You're upset and angry because your home was burned down. When I saw the forest had burned I was sad and upset. But my friend gave me hope that the forest would grow back.
Sokka!
What happened?
You were trapped in the Spirit world for 24 hours. How are you feeling?
Thank you, Avatar. If there only were a way to repay you for what you've done.
You could give us some supplies and some money.
What? We need stuff.
I'm so proud of you, Aang. You figured out what to do all on your own.
Actually, I did have a little help. And there's something else. 
What is it?
I need to talk to Roku and I think I've found a way to contact his spirit.
That's great!
Creepy, but great.
There's a temple on a crescent shaped island, and if I go there on the solstice I'll be able to speak with him.
But, the solstice is tomorrow.
Yeh, and there's one more problem. The island is in the Fire Nation.
The Earth Kingdom city of Omashu!
I used to always come here to visit my friend, Bumi.
Wow. We don't have cities like this in the South Pole.
Well, let's go slow pokes! The real fun is inside the city!
Wait, Aang! It could be dangerous if people find out you're the Avatar.
You need a disguise.
So, what am I supposed to do? Grow a mustache?
Ohh, this is so itchy!  How do you live in this stuff? 
Great! Now you look just like my grandfather.
Technically, Aang is 112 years old.
You guys are gonna love Omashu. The people here are the friendliest in the world.
Just keep smiling...
My business is my business, young man, and none of yours! I've got half a mind to bend you over my knee and paddle your backside!
Name's Bonzu Pipinpadaloxicopolis, the Third, and these are my grandkids.
We will.
Good idea! 
This is the Omashu delivery system. Miles and miles of tubes and chutes. Earthbending brings the packages up and gravity brings them down. 
Great, so they get their mail on time.
They do get their mail on time, but my friend Bumi found a better use for these chutes...
Look around you, what do you see?
Umm... the mail system?
A package sending system?
The world's greatest super slide!
Bumi, you're a mad genius!
One ride, then we're off to the North Pole, Airbender's honor.
This sounded like fun at first, but now that I'm here, I'm starting to have second thoughts!
I'm on it! I'm on it!
Men, you'll be going off to combat soon. It's important that you be prepared for anything.
Aang, do something! Use your airbending!
Yeh! Good idea! That'll make us go even faster!
Sorry!
Your majesty, these juveniles were arrested for vandalism, traveling under false pretenses and malicious destruction of cabbages.
Silence! Only the King can pass down judgment. What is your judgment, Sire?
Huh?
Thanks, but I don't eat meat.
I'm from... Kangaroo Island.
What? It was pretty funny.
Okay! You caught me. I'm the Avatar, doing my Avatar thing, keeping the world safe. Everything checks out , no firebenders here. So, good work everybody.  Love each other, respect all life and don't run with your spears. We'll see you next time!
You can't keep us here. Let us leave.
We're in serious trouble. This guy is nuts.
My liege, do you mean the good chamber, or the bad chamber?
Wait, which one are we talking about?
This is a prison cell? But it's so nice.
He did say it was newly refurbished.
Nice or not, we're still prisoners.
I wonder what these challenges are gonna be.
We're not sticking around to find out. There's gotta be some way outta here.
If you think we're gonna fit through there then you're crazier then that king.
We can't, but Momo can.
Momo, I need you to find Appa and bust us outta here!
Go on, boy, get Appa!
Eh, how was Appa supposed to save us anyway?
Well, no point in arguing about it now.  Get some rest, Aang. Looks like you'll need it for tomorrow.
Sokka! Katara!  Where are my friends?
The King will free them if you complete your challenges.
And if I fail?
He didn't say. Your staff please?
I... guess it's fine.
Really?
I don't have time for your crazy games! Gimme my friends back! We're leaving!
Ah! It's already creeping!
There, enjoy your lunch! I want my friends back, now!
Okay, found him!
Come here, Flopsy!
Flopsy, wait! Flopsy! Flopsy!
Flopsy! 
Guys, are you ok?
Other than the crystal slowly encasing my entire body, doing great.
I... choose... you! 
Can I fight the guy with the axe instead?
Huh?
That's not fair! You said you would release my friends if I finished your tests.
Oh come on!
How am I supposed to know his name?
Think about the challenges, maybe it's some kind of riddle.
I got it!
Yeh?
He's an earthbender, right? Rocky!  You know, because of all the rocks?
We're gonna keep trying, but that is a good backup.
Okay, so back to the challenges. I got a key from the waterfall. I saved his pet and I had a duel.
And what did you learn?
Well, everything was different than I expected.
Well, they weren't straightforward. To solve each test, I had to think differently than I usually would.  I know his name!
I solved the question the same way I solved the challenges. As you said a long time ago, I had to open my brain to the possibilities.  Bumi, you're a mad genius! 
Uh, over here!
Little help?
So this crazy king is your old friend, Bumi?
Why did you do all this instead of just telling Aang who you were?
Thank you for your wisdom. But before we leave, I have a challenge for you!
Yay! Aang's back!
Aang didn't do anything. It was an accident.
Yeh, we were on the ship and there was this booby trap and well...  ...we “boobied” right into it.
Don't blame Katara! I brought her there.  It's my fault.
Aha! The traitor confesses! Warriors, away from the enemy!  The foreigner is banned from our village!
No! I'm keeping my promise to Dad. I'm protecting you from threats like him!
Fun? We can't fight firebenders with fun!
Get out of our village. Now!
Grandmother, please, don't let Sokka do this.
Then I'm banished too!
C'mon, Aang, let's go!
To find a waterbender! Aang is taking me to the North Pole!
Katara!  Would you really choose him over your tribe? Your own family?
Katara, I don't want to come between you and your family.
So, you're leaving the South Pole? This is goodbye?
Thanks for penguin sledding with me.
Where will you go?
It was nice meeting everyone.
Let's see your bison fly now, air boy.
Come on, Appa, you can do it! Yip! Yip!
Yeh, I thought so.
Come on, boy.
All right! Ready our defenses! The Fire Nation could be on our shores any moment now!
Yeh, I liked her too.
The village!  Appa, wait here!
Ohhh, man!
Sokka, get out of the way!
Where are you hiding him?
He'd be about this age? Master of all elements?
I know you're hiding him!
Hey Katara. Hey Sokka.
Looking for me?
Aang?
No way.
I've spent years preparing for this encounter. Training. Meditating. You're just a child!
Well, you're just a teenager.
If I go with you, will you promise to leave everyone alone?
No, Aang! Don't do this!
Don't worry, Katara, it'll be okay.  Take care of Appa for me until I get back.
Head a course to the Fire Nation. I'm going home.
We have to go after that ship, Sokka. Aang saved our tribe; now we have to save him.
Katara, I—
Why can't you realize that he's on our side? If we don't help him, no one will. I know you don't like Aang, but we owe him and I—
Katara! Are you gonna talk all day or are you comin' with me?
Get in. We're going to save your boyfriend.
He's not my—
Whatever.
Yeah... okay, Gran.
Appa!
You just love taking me out of my comfort zone, don't ya?
This staff will make an excellent gift for my father. I suppose you wouldn't know of fathers, being raised by monks. Take the Avatar to the prison hold. And  take this to my quarters.
Hey, you mind taking this to his quarters for me?
So... I guess you never fought an airbender before. I bet I can take you both with my hands tied behind my back.
Please, Appa, we need your help. Aang needs your help.
Up. Ascend. Elevate.
Sokka doesn't believe you can fly, but I do, Appa.  Come on. Don't you wanna save Aang?
What was it that kid said? Yee-ha? Hup hup? Wahoo? Uh... yip yip?
He's flying! He's flying! Katara, he's—!  I mean, big deal, he's flying.
Thanks anyway!
My staff!
Looks like I underestimated you.
What is that?
Appa!
Now that was some waterbending!
Well, I couldn't let you have all the glory.
I dropped my staff.
Got it!
Ha! That's from the Water Tribe!
Katara!
Hurry up, Sokka!
Yip yip! Yip yip!
Shoot them down!
Good news for the Fire Lord. The nation's greatest threat is just a little kid.
That kid, Uncle, just did this.  I won't underestimate him again. Dig this ship out and follow them!  As soon as you're done with that.
How did you do that? With the water? It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar?
Because... I never wanted to be.
But Aang, the world's been waiting for the Avatar to return and finally put an end to this war.
According to legend, you need to first master water, then earth, then fire, right?
That's what the monks told me.
Well, if we go to the North Pole you can master waterbending.
And Sokka, I'm sure you'll get to knock some firebender heads on the way.
Then we're in this together.
What's there?
Here  we'll ride the hopping llamas. Then waaaay over here  we'll surf on the backs of giant koi fish. Then back over here we'll ride the hog-monkeys. They don't like people riding them, but that's what makes it fun!
The only reason you should be interrupting me is if you have news about the Avatar. 
Well, there is news, Prince Zuko, but you might not like it. Don't get too upset. 
Uncle, you taught me that keeping a level head is a sign of a great leader. Now whatever you have to say, I'm sure that I can take it. 
Okay, then... we have no idea where he is. 
WHAT?!
You really should open a window in here.
Give me the map!
There have been multiple sightings of the Avatar, but he is impossible to track down.
How am I gonna find him, Uncle? 
He is clearly a master of evasive maneuvering.
You have no idea where you're going, do you?
Weeelll, I know it's near water...
I guess we're getting close then.
Momo, marbles please.
Hey Katara! Check out this airbending trick!
That's great, Aang.
You didn't even look.
That's great!
But I'm not doing it now.
Stop bugging her, airhead. You need to give girls space when they do their sewing.
What does me being a girl have to do with sewing?
Simple: girls are better at fixing pants than guys, and guys are better at hunting and fighting and stuff like that. It's just the natural order of things.
All done with your pants! And look what a great job I did!
Wait! I was just kidding! I can't wear these!  Katara, PLEASE!
Don't worry, Sokka. Where we're going, you won't need any pants!
We just made a pit stop yesterday. Shouldn't we get a little more flying done before we camp out?
He's right. At this rate we won't get to the North Pole until spring.
But Appa's tired already, aren't you boy? I said, aren't you boy? 
Yeah, that was real convincing. Still, hard to argue with a ten ton magical monster.
LOOK!  That's why we're here... ... elephant koi. And I'm going to ride it. Katara, you've gotta watch me!  COLD!
Woo!
Yeeaaaah! Woohoo! (Aang is laughing, ecstatic as he rides the giant koi fish. A couple of other fish follow behind, leaping in and out of the water.
He looks pretty good out there.
Are you kidding? The fish is doing all the work.
No, Appa! Don't eat that! 
Aww, man...
There's something in the water!
What's wrong?
Aang's in trouble.  Aang!
Get out of there!
Come back here! AANG!
AANG!
Aaahhh!
What was that thing?
I don't know.
Well, let's not stick around and find out. Time to hit the road.
Oof!
Ugh!
Uhh...
Oof... Or we could stay a while...
You three have some explaining to do.
And if you don't answer all our questions, we're throwing you back in the water with the unagi.
Show yourselves, cowards!
Who are you? Where are the men who ambushed us?
There were no men. We ambushed you. Now tell us, who are you and what are you doing here?
Wait a second, there's no way that a bunch of girls took us down.
A bunch of girls, huh? The unagi's gonna eat well tonight.
No, don't hurt him! He didn't mean it. My brother is just an idiot sometimes.
It's my fault. I'm sorry we came here. I wanted to ride the elephant koi.
How do we know you're not Fire Nation spies? Kyoshi stayed out of the war so far. And we intend to keep it that way!
This island is named for Kyoshi? I know Kyoshi!
Ha! How could you possibly know her? Avatar Kyoshi was born here four hundred years ago. She's been dead for centuries.
I know her because I'm the Avatar.
That's impossible! The last Avatar was an airbender who disappeared a hundred years ago.
That's me!
Throw the imposter to the unagi!
Aang... do some airbending...
It's true... you are the Avatar!
Now... check this out! 
HUH? 
The Avatar's on Kyoshi Island?  Uncle, ready the rhinos. He's not getting away from me this time.
Are you going to finish that?
I was going to save it for later! 
All right! Dessert for breakfast!  These people sure know how to treat an Avatar!
Mmm... Katara you've got to try these! 
Well, maybe just a bite... 
Sokka, what's your problem? EAT!
Not hungry.
But you're always hungry!
He's just upset because a bunch of girls kicked his butt yesterday.
They snuck up on me!
Right. And then they kicked your butt.
Sneak attacks don't count!  Tie me up with ropes! I'll show them a thing or two. I'm not scared of any girls.  Who do they think they are anyway?  Mmm... this is tasty.
What's he so angry about? It's great here. They're giving us the royal treatment.
Hey, don't get too comfortable. It's risky for us to stay in one place for very long.
I'm sure we'll be fine. Besides, did you see how happy I'm making this town?  They're even cleaning up that statue in my honor!
Well, it's nice to see you excited about being the Avatar. I just hope it doesn't all go to your head.
Come on, you know me better than that. I'm just a simple monk.
Painting the Avatar... that's easy enough...
Oh... there's another one... I'll make an adjustment here, and...
There's more... what...
Sorry ladies! Didn't mean to interrupt your dance lesson.  I was just looking for somewhere to get a little workout? 
Well, you're in the right place.
Sorry about yesterday. I didn't know that you were friends with the Avatar.
It's all right. I mean, normally I'd hold a grudge, but seeing as you guys are a bunch of girls, I'll make an exception. 
I should hope so. A big strong man like you? We wouldn't stand a chance.
True. But don't feel bad. After all, I'm the best warrior in my village.
Wow! Best warrior, huh? In your whole village? Maybe you'd be kind enough to give us a little demonstration.
Oh... well... I mean... I...
Come on, girls! Wouldn't you like him to show us some moves?
Well, if that's what you want, I'd be happy to. All right, you stand over there.  This may be a little tough, but try to block me.
Heh heh... good. Of course, I was going easy on you.
Of course.
Let's see if you can handle this!
That does it!
Anything else you want to teach us?
There she is, girls. Me in a past life.
Ooohhh... 
You were pretty!
Excuse me for a second, ladies.
Oh, good! Can you help me carry this back to the room? It's a little heavy.
Actually, I can't right now.
What do you mean you can't?
I promised the girls that I'd give them a ride on Appa. Why don't
Watching you show off for a bunch of girls does not sound like fun.
Well, neither does carrying your basket.
It's not my basket. These supplies are for our trip. I told you, we have to leave Kyoshi soon.
I don't want to leave Kyoshi yet. I can't put my finger on it, but there's something I really like about this place.
What's taking you so long, Aangy?
Aangy...
Just a second, Koko!
'Simple monk,' huh? I thought you promised me that this Avatar stuff wouldn't go to your head.
It didn't. You know what I think? You just don't want to come because you're jealous.
Jealous? Of what?
Jealous that we're having so much fun without you.
That's ridiculous.
It is a little ridiculous, but I understand.
Uh... hey, Suki.
Hoping for another dance lesson?
No... I... well, let me explain.
Spit it out! What do you want?
I would be honored if you would teach me.
Even if I'm a girl?
I'm sorry if I insulted you earlier. I was wrong.
We normally don't teach outsiders, let alone boys.
Please make an exception. I won't let you down.
All right. But you have to follow all of our traditions.
Of course!
And I mean ALL of them.
Do I really have to wear this? It feels a little... girly.
It's a warrior's uniform. You should be proud.  The silk threads symbolizes the brave blood that flows through our veins. The gold insignia represents the honor of the warrior's heart.
Bravery and honor.
Hey Sokka! Nice dress!
Katara, remember how the unagi almost got me yesterday?
Yeah.
Well, I'm gonna go ride it now. It's gonna be REAL dangerous.
Good for you.
You're not going to stop me?
Nope. Have fun.
I will.
Great.
I know it's great.
I'm glad you know.
I'm glad you're glad.
Good!
Fine!
You're not going to master it in one day. Even I'm not that good.
I think I'm starting to get it.
It's not about strength. Our technique is about using your opponents' force against them. Loosen up. Think of the fan as an extension of your arm.  Wait for an opening and then... 
Hmm...
I fell on purpose to make you feel better!
I got you! Admit I got you! 
Okay, it was a lucky shot. Let's see if you can do it again.
What's taking so long?
I'm sure it will be here any second!  What about this? 
Where's the unagi? It's getting late.
Where're you going? Don't leave!
Sorry, Aang! Maybe next time.
Katara! You came!
I wanted to make sure you were safe. You really had me worried.
Back there you acted like you didn't care.
I'm sorry.
Me too. I did let all that attention go to my head. I was being a jerk.
Well, get out of the water before you catch a cold, you big jerk!
On my way!
Hang on, Aang!
Zuko!
I want the Avatar alive.
Wake up, Aang! 
Katara... don't ride the unagi. Not fun.
Not bad.
Firebenders have landed on our shores! Girls, come quickly!
Hey, I'm not a... oh, whatever!
Come out, Avatar! You can't hide from me forever!  Find him.
I guess training's over.
Nice try, Avatar! But these little girls can't save you.
Hey! Over here!
Finally!
Get inside.
Look what I brought to this place. 
It's not your fault.
Yes, it is. These people got their town destroyed trying to protect me.
Then let's get out of here. Zuko will leave Kyoshi to follow us. I know it feels wrong to run, but I think it's the only way.
I'll call Appa.
There's no time to say goodbye.
What about, "I'm sorry"?
For what?
I treated you like a girl when I should have treated you like a warrior.
I am a warrior.  But I'm a girl, too.  Now get out of here! We'll hold them off.
Appa, yip yip!
Back to the ship! Don't lose sight of them!
I know it's hard, but you did the right thing. Zuko would have destroyed the whole place if we had stayed. They're going to be okay, Aang. 
What are you doing?!
Thank you, Avatar.
I know, I know. That was stupid and dangerous.
Yes, it was.
Wait 'til you see it, Katara. The Air Temple is one of the most beautiful places in the world.
Aang, I know you're excited, but it's been a hundred years since you've been home.
That's why I'm so excited!
It's just that a lot can change in all that time.
I know, but I need to see it for myself.
Wake up, Sokka! Air Temple here we come!
Sleep now... temple later...
Sokka! Wake up!  There's a prickle snake in your sleeping bag!
Aaahhh! Get it off! Get it off! Aaahhh! 
Great! You're awake. Let's go.
Uncle, I want the repairs made as quickly as possible. I don't want to stay too long and risk losing his trail.
You mean the Avatar?
Don't mention his name on these docks! Once word gets out that he's alive every firebender will be out looking for him and I don't want anyone getting in the way.
Getting in the way of what, Prince Zuko?
Captain Zhao.
It's Commander now. And General Iroh--  --great hero of our nation.
Retired general.
The Fire Lord's brother and son are welcome guests any time. What brings you to my harbor?
Our ship is being repaired. 
That's quite a bit of damage.
Yes... you wouldn't believe what happened.  Uncle! Tell Commander Zhao what happened.
Yes, I will do that. It was incredible.  What... did we crash or something?
Uh, yes! Right into an Earth Kingdom ship.
Really? You must regale me with all the thrilling details.  Join me for a drink?
Sorry, but we have to go.
Prince Zuko, show Commander Zhao your respect.  We would be honored to join you. Do you have any ginseng tea? It's my favorite.
Hey, stomach, be quiet, all right? I'm trying to find us some food. 
Hey! Who ate all my blubbered seal jerky?
Oh, that was food? I used it to start the campfire last night. Sorry.
You WHAT? Awww, no wonder the flames smelled so good.
The Batola mountain range! We're almost there!
Aang? Before we get to the temple, I want to talk to you about the airbenders.
What about 'em?
Well, I just want you to be prepared for what you might see. The Fire Nation is ruthless. They killed my mother and they could have done the same to your people.
Just because no one has seen an airbender doesn't mean the Fire Nation killed them all.  They probably escaped.
I know it's hard to accept.
You don't understand, Katara. The only way to get to an airbender temple is on a flying bison, and I doubt the Fire Nation has any flying bison. Right, Appa?
Yip yip! 
There it is... the Southern Air Temple.
Aang, it's amazing!
We're home, buddy. We're home.
And by year's end, the Earth Kingdom capital will be under our rule. 
The Fire Lord will finally claim victory in this war.
If my father thinks the rest of the world will follow him willingly, then he is a fool. 
Two years at sea have done little to temper your tongue.  So, how is your search for the Avatar going?
My fault entirely. 
We haven't found him yet.
Did you really expect to? The Avatar died a hundred years ago--  --along with the rest of the airbenders. 
Unless you found some evidence that the Avatar is alive.
No. Nothing.
Prince Zuko, the Avatar is the only one who can stop the Fire Nation from winning this war.  If you have an ounce--  --of loyalty left, you'll tell me what you've found.
I haven't found anything. It's like you said. The Avatar probably died a long time ago. Come on, Uncle, we're going.
Commander Zhao, we interrogated the crew as you instructed. They confirmed Prince Zuko had the Avatar in custody, but let him escape.
Now, remind me... 
... how exactly was your ship damaged? 
So where do I get something to eat? 
You're lucky enough to be one of the first outsiders to ever visit an airbender temple and all you can think about is food? 
I'm just a simple guy with simple needs.
So that's where my friends and I would play airball!
And... over there would be where the bison would sleep... and... 
What's wrong?
This place used to be full of monks and lemurs and bison. Now there's just a bunch of weeds. 
I can't believe how much things have changed.
So, uh, this airball game? How do you play? 
Hahaha! Aang seven, Sokka zero! 
Making him feel better is putting me in a world of hurt.
Katara, check this out.
Fire Nation.
We should tell him.
Aang, there's something you need to see.
Okay!
What is it?
Uh... just a new waterbending move I learned.
Nice one. But enough practicing. We have a whole temple to see! 
You know, you can't protect him forever.
Katara, firebenders were here. You can't pretend they weren't.
I can for Aang's sake. 
If he finds out that the Fire Nation invaded his home, he'll be devastated.
Hey guys! 
I want you to meet somebody.
Who's that?
Monk Gyatso, the greatest airbender in the world. He taught me everything I know. 
But the true secret...
... is in the gooey center!
Hmm...
My ancient cake making technique isn't the only thing on your mind, is it, Aang?
This whole Avatar thing... maybe the monks made a mistake.
The only mistake they made was telling you before you turned sixteen. But we can't concern ourselves with what was. We must act on what is.
But Gyatso, how do I know if I'm ready for this?
Your questions will be answered when you are old enough to enter the Air Temple sanctuary.  Inside you will meet someone who will guide you on your journey.
Who is it?
When you are ready he will reveal himself to you. 
Now, are you going to help me with these cakes, or not?
All right.
One... two... three!
Your aim has improved greatly my young pupil.
You must miss him.
Yeah. 
Where are you going?
The Air Temple Sanctuary. There's someone I'm ready to meet. 
But Aang... no one could have survived in there for a hundred years.
It's not impossible. I survived in the iceberg for that long.
Good point.
Katara, whoever's in there might help me figure out this Avatar thing!
And whoever's in there might have a medley of delicious, cured meats!
I don't suppose you have a key?
The key, Sokka, is airbending.
Hello? Anyone home? 
So, a twelve-year-old boy bested you and your firebenders?  You're more pathetic than I thought.
I underestimated him once, but it will not happen again.
No, it will not, because you won't have a second chance.
Commander Zhao, I've been hunting the Avatar for two years and I...
And you failed! 
Capturing the Avatar is too important to leave in a teenager's hands. He's mine now. 
Keep them here.
More tea please?
Statues?! That's it? Where's the meat? 
Who are all these people?
I'm not sure, but it feels like I know them somehow. Look!  That one's an airbender!
And this one's a waterbender. They're lined up in a pattern. Air, water, earth and fire.
That's the Avatar cycle.
Of course! They're Avatars. All these people are your past lives, Aang.
Wow! There's so many!
Past lives? Katara, you really believe in that stuff?
It's true. When the Avatar dies he's reincarnated into the next nation in the cycle.
Aang, snap out of it!
Huh?
Who is that?
That's Avatar Roku, the Avatar before me.
You were a firebender? No wonder I didn't trust you when we first met.
There's no writing. How do you know his name?
I'm not sure... I just know it somehow.
You just couldn't get any weirder!
Firebender. Nobody make a sound.
You're making a sound!
That firebender won't know what hit 'em.
Lemur!
Dinner...
Don't listen to him! You're going to be my new pet.
Not if I get him first!
Wait! Come back!
I wanna eat you!
Oof! 
Hey! No Fair!
My search party is ready. 
Once I'm out to sea, my guards will escort you back to your ship and you'll be free to go.
Why? Are you worried I'm going to try and stop you?
You? Stop me? Impossible.
Don't underestimate me, Zhao. I will capture the Avatar before you. 
Prince Zuko, that's enough!
You can't compete with me. I have hundreds of warships under my command, and you... you're just a banished prince. No home. No allies. Your own father doesn't even want you.
You're wrong. Once I deliver the Avatar to my father he will welcome me home with honor and restore my rightful place on the throne.
If your father really wanted you home, he'd have let you return by now, Avatar or no Avatar, but in his eyes you are a failure and a disgrace to the Fire Nation.
That's not true.
You have the scar to prove it.
Maybe you'd like one to match!
Is that a challenge?
An agni kai. At sunset.
Very well. It's a shame your father won't be here to watch me humiliate you. I guess your uncle will do.
Prince Zuko, have you forgotten what happened last time you dueled a master?
I will never forget. 
Hey! Come back! 
Come on out, little lemur. That hungry guy won't bother you anymore.
Firebenders? They were here?
Gyatso... 
Hey Aang, you find my dinner yet? 
Aang, I wasn't really going to eat the lemur, okay?  Oh, man... come on, Aang, everything will be all right. Let's get out of here.
Aang!
Aang! Come on, snap out of it!
Aaahhh!
What happened?
He found out firebenders killed Gyatso.
Oh no, it's his avatar spirit! He must have triggered it! I'm gonna try and calm him down.
Well, do it before he blows us off the mountain! 
Remember your firebending basics, Prince Zuko. They are your greatest weapons.
I refuse to let him win. 
This will be over quickly. 
Basics, Zuko! Break his root!
Do it! 
That's it? Your father raised a coward.
Next time you get in my way, I promise I won't hold back.
No, Prince Zuko. Do not taint your victory. 
So this is how the great Commander Zhao acts in defeat.  Disgraceful. 
Even in exile my nephew is more honorable than you.  Thanks again for the tea. It was delicious.
Did you really mean that, Uncle?
Of course. I told you ginseng tea is my favorite.
Aang, I know you're upset... 
... and I know how hard it is to lose the people you love. I went through the same thing when I lost my mom. Monk Gyatso and the other airbenders may be gone, but you still have a family. Sokka and I, we're your family now.
Katara and I aren't going to let anything happen to you. Promise.
I'm sorry.
It's okay. It wasn't your fault.
But you were right. And if firebenders found this temple that means they found the other ones, too. I really am the last airbender. 
Everything's packed. You ready to go?
How is Roku supposed to help me if I can't talk to him?
Maybe you'll find a way.
Looks like you made a new friend, Sokka.
Can't talk. Must eat.
Hey little guy.
You, me, and Appa.  We're all that's left of this place. We have to stick together. Katara, Sokka... 
... say hello to the newest member of our family. 
What are you going to name him?
Momo.
It's not getting away from me this time. Watch and learn, Katara. This is how you catch a fish.
Sokka, look!
Shhh. Katara, you're gonna scare it away. Mmmm... I can already smell it cookin'!
Hey!
It's not magic. It's waterbending, and it's-
Yeah, yeah, an ancient art unique to our culture, blah blah blah. Look, I'm just saying that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself.
You're calling me weird? I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself every time I see my reflection in the water.
Watch out! Go left! Go left!
You call that left?
You don't like my steering. Well, maybe you should have waterbended us out of the ice.
So it's my fault?
I knew I should have left you home. Leave it to a girl to screw things up.
You are the most sexist, immature, nut brained...
Ugh, I'm embarrassed to be related to you! Ever since Mom died I've been doing all the work around camp while you've been off playing soldier!
I even wash all the clothes! Have you ever smelled your dirty socks? Let me tell you, NOT PLEASANT!
Katara! Settle down!
No, that's it. I'm done helping you. From now on, you're on your own!
Okay, you've gone from weird to freakish, Katara.
You mean I did that?
Yup. Congratulations.
He's alive! We have to help.
Katara! Get back here! We don't know what that thing is!
Finally.  Uncle, do you realize what this means?
I won't get to finish my game?
It means my search - it's about to come to an end.
That light came from an incredibly powerful source. It has to be him!
Or it's just the celestial lights. We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko. I don't want you to get too excited over nothing. Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming jasmine tea?
Stop it!
What?
What is it?
Uh... sure. I guess.
Ahh!
What's going on here?
You tell us! How'd you get in the ice?  And why aren't you frozen?
Appa! Are you all right? Wake up, buddy.
Haha! You're okay!
What is that thing?
This is Appa, my flying bison.
Right. And this is Katara, my flying sister.
Ewww! Aahh!!!
Don't worry. It'll wash out.
Ugh!
So, do you guys live around here?
Don't answer that! Did you see that crazy bolt of light? He was probably trying to signal the Fire Navy.
Oh, yeah, I'm sure he's a spy for the Fire Navy. You can tell by that evil look in his eye.
The paranoid one is my brother, Sokka. You never told us your name.
I'm A... aaaahhhh... ahhhhhh.... aaah aaah aaah AAAAAAACHOOOO!
I'm Aang. 
You just sneezed... and flew ten feet in the air.
Really? It felt higher that that.
Sure am.
Giant light beams... flying bison... airbenders... I think I've got Midnight Sun Madness. I'm going home to where stuff makes sense.
Well, if you guys are stuck Appa and I can give you a lift.
We'd love a ride! Thanks! 
Oh, no... I am not getting on that fluffy snot monster.
Are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home? You know... before you freeze to death?
Okay. First time flyers, hold on tight! Appa, yip yip!
Wow. That was truly amazing.
Appa's just tired. A little rest and he'll be soaring through the sky. You'll see.
Why are you smiling at me like that?
Oh... I was smiling?
I'm going to bed now.  Yep. A man needs his rest. Prince Zuko, you need some sleep. Even if you're right and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him. Your father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all tried and failed.
Because their honor didn't hinge on the Avatar's capture. Mine does. This coward's hundred years in hiding are over.
Hey.
Hey. Whatcha thinkin' about?
I guess I was wondering – your being an airbender and all – if you had any idea what happened to the Avatar.
Okay. Just curious. Goodnight.
Sleep tight.
Aaahhh!
Whaaaa!
Aang, this is the entire village. Entire village, Aang.
Uh... why are they all looking at me like that? Did Appa sneeze on me?
'Extinct'?
Aang, this is my grandmother.
It's not for stabbing.  It's for airbending.
Not magic, airbending. It lets me control the air currents around my glider and fly.
You know, last time I checked, humans can't fly.
Check again!
Whoa... it's flying... it's amazing!
That was amazing.
Great. You're an airbender, Katara's a waterbender, together you can just waste time all day long.
You're a waterbender!
Well... sort of. Not yet.
I told you! He's the real thing, Gran Gran! I finally found a bender to teach me.
But he's special. I can tell. I sense he's filled with much wisdom.
Sthee? Now my tongue ith thuck to my sthaff.
Again.
Ha! Heeya!
No! Power in firebending comes from the breath. Not the muscles. The breath becomes energy in the body. The energy extends past your limbs and becomes fire.  Get it right this time.
Enough. I've been drilling this sequence all day. Teach me the next set. I'm more than ready.
No, you are impatient. You have yet to master your basics.  Drill it again!
Grrrr... huh!  The sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender. He must be over a hundred years old by now. He's had a century to master the four elements. I'll need more than basic firebending to defeat him. You WILL teach me the advanced set!
Very well. But first I must finish my roast duck.  Num num... num...
Now men, it's important that you show no fear when you face a firebender. In the Water Tribe, we fight to the last man standing. For without courage, how can we call ourselves men?
Listen! Until your fathers return from the war, they're counting on you to be the men of this tribe. And that means no potty breaks.
Have you seen Aang? Gran Gran said he disappeared over an hour ago.
Hahaha!
Ugh! Katara, get him out of here. This lesson is for warriors only.
Stop! Stop it right now!  What's wrong with you? We don't have time for fun and games with a war going on.
What war?  What are you talking about?
You're kidding, right?
PENGUIN!
He's kidding, right?
Aang?
Haha! Hey, come on little guy. Wanna go sledding?
Oof! Heh heh, I have a way with animals.  Yarp! Yarp yarp! Yarp! Yarp yarp! Yarp!
Hahaha... Aang, I'll help you catch a penguin if you teach me waterbending.
You got a deal! Just one little problem. I'm an airbender, not a waterbender. Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you?
This isn't right. A waterbender needs to master water. What about the North Pole? There's another Water Tribe up there, right? Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you.
Maybe. But we haven't had contact with our sister tribe in a long time. It's not exactly 'turn right at the second glacier.' It's on the other side of the world.
But you forget: I have a flying bison. Appa and I can personally fly you to the North Pole. Katara, we're gonna find you a master!
Well, you think about it. But in the meantime, can you teach me to catch one of these penguins?
I haven't done this since I was a kid!
You still are a kid!
Whoa... what is that?
Aang, stop! We're not allowed to go near it. The ship could be booby trapped.
If you wanna be a bender, you have to let go of fear.
This ship has haunted my tribe since Gran Gran was a little girl. It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks.
Okay, back up. I have friends all over the world, even in the Fire Nation. I've never seen any war.
Aang, how long were you in that iceberg?
I don't know... a few days, maybe?
I think it was more like a hundred years!
What? That's impossible. Do I look like a hundred-twelve year old man to you?
Think about it. The war is a century old. You don't know about it because, somehow, you were in there that whole time. It's the only explanation.
A hundred years! I can't believe it.
I did get to meet you.
Aang? Let's head back. This place is creepy.
Huh?
What's that you said about booby traps?
Uh oh.
Hold on tight!
...as well as his hiding place.
GRRRRRRR
Look, I'm sorry, but Katara and Sokka aren't coming to the Fire Nation with us. If they got hurt, I'd never forgive myself.  So get your big butt off the ground and let's go!
I think his big butt is trying to tell you something.
Please don't go, Aang. The world can't afford to lose you to the Fire Nation. Neither can I.
But I have to talk to Avatar Roku to find out what my vision means. I need to get to the Fire Temple before the sun sets on the Solstice. That's today. 
We're not letting you go into the Fire Nation, Aang.
At least not without your friends. We got your back.
EWWWWW
It's a long journey to the Crescent Island.  You'll have to fly fast to have any chance of making it befor/ie sundown. Good luck.
Thank you, for your...
Having trouble sleeping?  Seen the Avatar lately?
Come on, boy! We've got a long way to go! Faster! 
I have no choice, Uncle.
You give him too much credit. My brother is not the understanding type.
There they are! Helmsman, full steam ahead!
Aang, we got trouble.
Yeah, and its gaining fast!
On my mark.........Fire!
Fire ball!
I'm on it! 
Can't you make Appa go any faster?
A blockade!
If we fly north we can go around the Fire Nation ships and avoid the blockade. It's the only way.
There's no time.
This is exactly why I didn't want you to come. Its too dangerous.
And that's exactly why we're here.
Let's run this blockade.
Appa! Yip! Yip!
He's not turning around.
Please Prince Zuko, if the Fire Nation captures you, there is nothing I can do. Do not follow the Avatar.
The Avatar...and the banished Prince. This must be my lucky day.
Commander Zhao, what are your orders?
Shoot the Bison down.
But there's a Fire Navy ship out there, Sir, one of our own. What if it's hit?
So be it.  It belongs to a traitor.  Ignite!  Launch!!!
Appa! Are you ok?
Launch!
Ready......
Fire!
We made it!!!
Where do you think the Avatar is headed, Sit?
We're on a collision course!
We can make it!
The boarding party is ready to apprehend Prince Zuko, Sir.
Wait. Cut the engines. Let them pass.
Sir?
There it is! The island Roku's dragon took me to!
You did it buddy. Nice flying.
I don't see any guards.
The Fire Nation must have abandoned the temple when Avatar Roku died.
Its almost sundown. We'd better hurry.
Wait......I think I heard something.
Great! I am the Avatar.
I'll hold them off. Run!
Follow me!
Do you know where you're going?
Nope!  Wrong way!
Come back!
I don't want to fight you. I am a friend.
Firebenders aren't our friends.
I know why you're here, Avatar.
Yes.  You wish to speak to Avatar Roku. I can take you to him.
How?
Time is running out. Quickly!
What's he up to, Uncle? Why didn't Commander Zhao arrest me?
Because he wants to follow you. He knows you'll lead him to the prize you're both after...the Avatar.
If Zhao wants to follow our trail of smoke, then that's exactly what I'll let him do.
Avatar Roku once called this temple his home. He formed these secret passages out of the magma.
Did you know Avatar Roku?
No. But my grandfather knew him. Many generations of Fire Sages guarded this temple long before me. We all have a strong spiritual connection to this place.
Is that how you knew I was coming?
A few weeks ago, an amazing thing occurred. The statue of Avatar Roku, its eyes...began to glow!
That's when we were at the Air Temple. Avatar Roku's eyes were glowing there too! 
At that moment, we knew you had returned to the world.
If this is the Avatar's temple, why did the Sages attack me?
Things have changed. In the past, the Sages were loyal only to the Avatar. When Roku died, the Sages eagerly awaited for the next Avatar to return. But he never came.
They lost hope the Avatar would ever return. When Fire Lord Sozen began the war, my grandfather and the other Sages were forced to follow him.  I never wanted to serve the Fire Lord. When I learned you were coming, I knew I would have to betray the other Sages.
We'll follow these stairs to the sanctuary.  Once you're inside, wait for the light to hit Avatar Roku's statue. Only then will you be able to speak with him.
NO!
Shyu, what's wrong?
The sanctuary doors, they're closed.
Can't you just open them with firebending? Like you opened that other door?
No. Only a fully realized Avatar is powerful enough to open this door alone. Otherwise the Sages must open the doors together with five simultaneous fire blasts.
Five fire blasts, huh?  I think I can help you out.
Uncle, keep heading north. Zhao will follow the smoke trail while I use it as a cover.
Hmmmm
This is a little trick I picked up from my father. I seal the lamp oil inside an animal skin casing, Shyu lights the oil soaked twine and tada! Fake firebending!
You've really outdone yourself this time, Sokka.
This might actually work.
The Sages will hear the explosions, so as soon as they go off, you rush in.
Definitely.
They're still locked.
It didn't work.
Why won't it open! Aargh!
I don't get it. That blast looked as strong as any firebending I've seen.
Sokka! You're a genius!
Wait, how is Sokka genius? His plan didn't even work.
Come on Aang, let her dream.
You're right. Sokka's plan didn't work...but it looks like it did.
Did the definition of “genius” change in the last hundred years? 
Hurry! The Avatar has entered the sanctuary.
I don't know. But look at the scorch marks and down there!
Now, Aang!
Aang! Now's your chance!
The Avatar's coming with me!
Close the doors! Quickly!
Go!
He made it!
Why isn't it working? It's sealed shut!
Why isn't anything happening? I don't know what I'm doing! All I know is airbending! Please, Avatar Roku, talk to me!
It's good to see you, Aang. What took you so long?
Why did you help the Avatar?
Because it was once the Sages' duty. It is still our duty. 
What a moving and heartfelt performance. I'm certain the Fire Lord will understand when you explain why you betrayed him.
And Prince Zuko, it was a noble effort. But your little smoke screen didn't work. Two traitors, in one day, the Fire Lord will be pleased.
You're too late, Zhao. The Avatar's inside and the doors are sealed.
No matter. Sooner or later, he has to come out.
I have something very important to tell you, Aang. That is why, when you were in the spirit world, I sent my dragon to find you.
Is it about that vision? The one with the comet?
Yes.
What does it mean?
One hundred years ago, Fire Lord Sozen used that comet to begin the war. He and his firebending army harnessed its incredible power and dealt a deadly first strike against the other nations.
So the comet made them stronger?
Yes. Stronger than you could even imagine.
But that happened a hundred years ago. What does the comet have to do with the war now? 
Listen carefully.  Sozen's comet will return by the end of the summer. And Fire Lord Ozai will use its power to finish the war once and for all.  If he succeeds, even the Avatar won't be able to restore balance to the world. Aang, you must defeat the Fire Lord before the comet arrives.
But I haven't even started learning waterbending, not to mention earth and fire.
Mastering the elements takes years of discipline and practice. But if the world is to survive, you must do it by summer's end.
When those doors open, unleash all your firebending power.
How's Aang going to make it out of this?
How're we going to make it out of this?
What if I can't master all the elements in time? What if I fail?
I know you can do it Aang, for you have done it before. The solstice is ending. We must go our separate ways...for now.
But I won't be able to come back to the temple. What if I have questions? How will I talk to you? 
I am a part of you. When you need to talk to me again, you will find a way.  A great danger awaits you at the temple.  I can help you face the threat.  But only if you are ready.
I'm ready.
Ready...
No! Aang!
Fire!
Avatar Roku!
Avatar Roku's going to destroy the temple! We have to get out of here!
Not without Aang!
We got your back.
Thanks. Where's Shyu?
I don't know.
Save your stories for the Fire Lord. As far as I'm concerned, you're all guilty! Take them to the prison hold!
We need you, Aang.
I need you too.
Be careful guys! Guys?
Gyatso?
Why did you disappear?
I didn't mean to.
It's nothing, I just had a bad dream. Go back to sleep.
Don't have to tell me twice.
Are you all right, Aang?
I'm okay.
You seem to be having a lot of nightmares lately, you wanna tell me about it?
I think I just need some rest.
Look at those clear skies, buddy! Should be some smooth flying.
What happened in your dream?
Food eats people! 
Also, Momo could talk.  You said some very unkind things.
There is a storm coming. A big one.
The storm is approaching from the north. I suggest we alter our course and head southwest.
We know the Avatar is traveling northward, so we will do the same.
Prince Zuko, consider the safety of the crew.
The safety of the crew doesn't matter! 
Finding the Avatar is far more important than any individual's safety. 
He doesn't mean that, he's just all worked up.
Ah, it's good! It's perfect, I'm telling you!
I don't know if I like the sound of that swishing.
Swishing means it's ripe! It's the ripe juices swishing around, eh?
I think it's true, Katara, swishing means it's ripe.
You could get a job, smart guy.
Are you kidding? Shelter from what?
Enough! We are all a bit tired from being at sea so long. I'm sure after a bowl of noodles everyone will feel much better.
Sokka, maybe this isn't such a good idea. Look at the sky.
I said I was gonna do this job. I can't back out just because of some bad weather.
Aang is the bravest person I know! He has done nothing but help people and save lives since I met him. It's not his fault he disappeared, right Aang? Aang? What's wrong?
You're a horrible old man!
Hey, they left without saying goodbye!
I know! This one time I was...
I'm sorry for running away.
It's ok. That fisherman was way out of line.
Actually, he wasn't.
What do you mean?
I don't wanna talk about it.
It has to do with your dream, doesn't it?
Talk to me.
Well, it's kind of a long story.
I'm gonna try to get a little fire going.
I'll never forget the day the monks told me I was the Avatar.
I was playing with some other kids just outside the south wall. I was trying to teach them how to do the air scooter...
First, you form a ball. Then you gotta get on quick.
Quick, get on!
I made it up.
How do you know it's me?
Those were some of my favorite toys when I was little! 
I just chose them because they seemed fun. 
I fear that war may be upon us, young Avatar.
Try to understand, my nephew is a complicated young man. He has been through much...
Prince Zuko, what's wrong?
I want to go into the war chamber, but the guard won't let me pass! 
You're not missing anything, trust me. These meetings are dreadfully boring.
If I'm gonna rule this nation one day, don't you think I need to start learning as much as I can?
Very well. But you must promise not to speak. These old folks are a bit sensitive, you know.
The Earth Kingdom defenses are concentrated here. 
A dangerous battalion of their strongest earthbenders and fiercest warriors, so I am recommending the 41st division.
Zuko was right, you see, but it was not his place to speak out, and there were... dire consequences.
So you were upset that you were the Avatar? Why wouldn't you be excited about it?
Well, I didn't know how to feel about it. All I knew is that after I found out, everything began changing...
Hey, not bad! You guys have been practicing!
Great!
What do you mean?
After Zuko's outburst in the meeting, the Fire Lord became very angry with him. He said that Prince Zuko's challenge of the general was an act of complete disrespect, and there was only one way to resolve this...
That's right. Zuko looked upon the old general he had insulted and declared that he was not afraid. But Zuko misunderstood. When he turned to face his opponent, he was surprised to see it was not the General. Zuko had spoken out against a general's plan, but by doing so in the Fire Lord's war room, it was the Fire Lord whom he had disrespected. Zuko would have to duel his own father.
Then, just when I was starting to feel better, something worse happened.
Gyatso, I know you mean well, but you are letting your affection for the boy cloud your judgment.
But what we need is what's best for the world.  You and Aang must be separated. The Avatar will be sent away to the Eastern Air Temple to complete his training.
That's awful, Aang. I don't know what to say.
How could they do that to me! They wanted to take away everything I knew and everyone I loved!
Whoa! Hot cinders!
You have a right to be angry after the monks sent you away like that.
Well, that's not exactly what happened...
I never saw Gyatso again.
Next thing I knew, I was waking up in your arms after you found me in the iceberg.
You ran away.
You don't know what would've –
The world needed me and I wasn't there to help.
Aang...
The fisherman was right! I did turn my back on the world.
You're being too hard on yourself. Even if you did run away, I think it was meant to be. If you had stayed you would have been killed along with all the other airbenders.
You don't know that. 
I know it's meant to be this way. The world needs you now. You give people hope.
When Prince Zuko saw that it was his father who had come to duel him, he begged for mercy...
Please, father, I only had the fire nation's best interest at heart! I'm sorry I spoke out of turn!
I won't fight you.
I looked away.
It was no accident. After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by refusing to fight, Zuko had shown shameful weakness. As punishment he was banished and sent to capture the Avatar. Only then could he return with his honor.
Things will never return to normal. But the important thing is, the Avatar gives Zuko hope.
What do you mean? Where's Sokka?
I'm going with you.
Where were we hit?
Look!
The helmsman!
Where are they?
Come on, Appa!
The Avatar!
Then we must head directly into the eye of the storm.
I'm too young to die!
Hang on to the rope!
Uncle, I am sorry.
He doesn't have to apologize.
Actually, I don't eat meat.
Katara, I think you were right before. I'm done dwelling on the past. 
Really?
I can't make guesses about how things would have turned out if I hadn't run away. I'm here now and I'm going to make the most of it.
Do you hear that? It's stopped raining.
Appa!
Look!
He is taunting us.  You are so gonna be dinner!  Hey! Where's the fishing line?
Oh, I didn't think you would need it, Sokka. 
Aahh, it's all tangled!
Not tangled – woven.  I made you a necklace, Katara.  I thought since you lost your other one...
I don't see why I can't do both. 
Stop taunting me! 
You mean all of you or just your neck? I mean, uh, both look great.
Someone's being attacked by a platypus bear!
Make noise, it'll run off!
No, play dead, he'll lose interest!
Run down hill, then climb a tree!
No, punch him in the bill!
And then run in zigzags!
Whoa there!
Mmm! Lunch!  Lucky for you we came along.
Aunt who?
Wow, it must be. That explains why you were so calm.
But the fortuneteller was wrong! You didn't have a safe journey, you were almost killed!
Maybe we should go see Aunt Wu and learn our fortunes. It could be fun.
Oh come on, fortunetelling is nonsense.
What do ya know, an umbrella!
That proves it. 
I guess you're not really getting wet then.
Of course she predicted it was gonna rain. The sky's been gray all day.
Just admit you might be wrong and you can come under the umbrella.
Look, I'm going to predict the future now  – “It's going to keep drizzling.”  See!
Not everyone has the gift, Sokka.
Aunt Wu is expecting you.
Really?
My name is Meng and I'm Aunt Wu's assistant.
I'll try a curd puff.
Aang.
That rhymes with Meng! And you've got some pretty big ears, don't you?
Oh, don't be modest. They're huge! 
Well Aang, it is very nice to meet you. Very nice.
Likewise.
I can't believe we're here in the house of nonsense.
Try to keep an open mind, Sokka. There are things in this world that just can't be explained. Wouldn't it be nice to have some insight into your future?
It would be nice to have some bean curd puffs. 
I guess that's me.
Not bad. Not bad. Mmmm! 
Boring stuff, I'm sure. Love. Who she's going to marry. How many babies she's gonna have.
Actually, I have this special seaweed lotion. I could get you some if you want.  So, do you see anything interesting in my love line? 
Tell me more!
Looks like someone had a pretty good bathroom break.
Yeh, when I was in there...
I don't even wanna know!
But, you didn't read my palms or anything!
Wow, that's a big crack. 
Yes!
Really!?  Thank you, Aunt Wu! 
Well, now you got to see for yourselves that fortunetelling is just a big, stupid hoax.
You're just saying that because you're going to make yourself unhappy your whole life.
Ow!  That doesn't prove anything!
Why, what did she tell you?
Do you even hear yourself? 
The cloud reading will tell us if Mount Makapu will remain dormant for another year or if it will erupt.
Sure, I guess.  Hey Katara, don't you think that cloud looks like a flower?
Shh!!
Since I got you here, uh, there's something I want to tell you. I like you, but more than normal. 
Never mind.
Hi, Aunt Wu. Sorry to bother you.
About this man I'm supposed to marry ...is he gonna be handsome?  Oh, I hope he's tall!
Yes, please!
I can't believe all these saps.  Someone really needs to scream some sense at them.
They seem happy, Sokka.
Not for long. I'm gonna prove Aunt Wu's predictions are nonsense.  Hey, you. I bet Aunt Wu told you to wear those red shoes, didn't she?
Uh-huh. And how many times have you worn those shoes since you got that fortune?
Wow, thanks Aunt Wu.  Oh, wait, one more thing. How warmly should I dress tomorrow?
I don't care what Aunt Wu told you, you have to take a bath sometime!
So, Sokka, you know some stuff about ladies, right?
Well, there's this girl...
I think I know who you mean.
You do? And you're ok with it?
She does!?
Oh yeh, she's crazy about ya. All ya have to do now is not mess it up.
Well, how do I do that?
The number one mistake nice guys like you make: being too nice.
Yup. If you want to keep her interested you have to act aloof, like you don't really care one way or the other.
Hey Aang, I was wondering...
See ya later.
Okay, okay, but, one more thing.
Should I eat a mango or a papaya for breakfast tomorrow?
Ohhh, I hate papaya.
Oh, hey Katara. I didn't see you there.
Ugh. Papaya please.
Uh-huh. Would you like some?
You know me.  I don't really care what I eat.
Ok then. See you later.
Maybe aloof isn't my style.
Excuse me. Where can a guy find one of those things?
Not just any flower – a panda lilly. I've seen it in action and boy does it work.
But my heart is telling me to get this flower, and Aunt Wu said if I trusted my heart I would be with the one I love.
What? Don't tell me you believe in that stuff too.
Well, Aunt Wu hasn't been wrong yet. Why should she be wrong about love?  There, on the rim!
Oh no! Aunt Wu was wrong.
Those people all think they're safe. We've got to warn'em.
There's no time to walk.  Grab on. 
Aaahhh!
Hi, Katara.
Can you believe she won't let me in? And after all the business I've given her?
But, she doesn't even charge.
I know, but still.
Well, we have other things to worry about. Aunt Wu was wrong about the volcano.
Sokka, you tried to convince me she was wrong before. It's going to take an awful lot to change my min –
Oh, no!
Everyone! That volcano is gonna blow any second. Aunt Wu was wrong!
If you won't listen to him, maybe you'll listen to me. I want to believe Aunt Wu and her predictions as much as you do, but my brother and Aang saw the lava with their own eyes.
Please listen to us! You are all in danger! And we have to get out of here. You can't rely on Aunt Wu's prediction. You have to take fate into your own hands.
They just won't listen to reason. 
But they will listen to Aunt Wu.
I know, that's the problem.
Well, it's about to become the solution. We're taking fate in our own ha Oh look! nds. First, I need to borrow Aunt Wu's cloud reading book.
Oh! I didn't see you there.
You don't like me. Do you? 
Of course I like you.
But not the way I like you.
Oh. I guess not.
It's ok. It's just really hard when you like someone, but they don't think of you that way.
She's beautiful, by the way.
That water tribe girl. I can see why you like her so much.  She's sweet, she's a bender, and her hair seems so manageable. 
Don't worry. You're gonna meet a great guy who's gonna completely fall for you. I know it. 
Thanks.  Wait! Don't you want this? 
How did you know?
Clouds are made of water and air so between the two of us we ought to be able to bend them into any shape we want.
Aunt Wu, look! Something is happening in the clouds.
We can still save the village if we act fast. Sokka has a plan.
Lava is gonna flow downhill to this spot. If we can dig a deep enough trench we can channel all the lava away from the village to the river.
If any of you are earthebenders come with me.
Everybody else grab a shovel ... come on, we've gotta hurry!
Dig faster! Dig faster!
Everyone needs to evacuate! We'll come for you when it's safe!
It's too much! It's gonna overflow!
Man, sometimes I forget what powerful bender  that kid is.
Wait, what did you just say?
Nothing, just that Aang is one powerful bender.
I suppose he is...
No offense, but I hope this taught everyone a lesson about not relying too much on fortunetelling.
Can I ask you something?
You didn't really see love in my fortune, did you? You just told me what I wanted to hear.
Goodbye everyone! It was so nice to meet you! Take care, Meng.
Would you sit down? If we hit a bump you'll go flying off! What's bugging you anyway?
It's what Avatar Roku said. I'm supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives.
Well, let's see, you've pretty much mastered airbending and that only took you 112 years... I'm sure you can master three more elements by next summer.
Calm down. It's going to be okay. If you want, I can try and teach you some of the stuff I know.
You'd do that?
We'll need to find a good source of water first.
Maybe we can find a puddle for you to splash in.
Nice puddle.
Yehhh! Don't start without me, boy!
Remember the reason we're here.
Oh right, time to practice waterbending. 
Great. So what am I supposed to do?
You could... clean the gunk out of Appa's toes?
So, while you guys are playing in the water, I'm supposed to be hard at work picking the mud out of a giant bison's feet?
Someone's changing our course!
What's the meaning of this mutiny? No one told you to change course!
Actually, someone did. I assure you it is a matter of utmost importance, Prince Zuko.
Is it something to do with the Avatar?
Even more urgent. It seems... I've lost my lotus tile.
Lotus tile?
For my Pai Sho game. Most people think the lotus tile insignificant, but it is essential for the unusual strategy that I employ.
See, you, like most people, underestimate its value. Just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call. Hopefully they'll have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life!
I'm lucky to have such an understanding nephew.
Yeh, don't get too happy. You gotta do me next.
This is a pretty basic move, but it still took me months to perfect, so don't be frustrated if you don't get it right away. Just push and pull the water like this... 
The key is getting the wrist movement right.
That's almost right, if you keep practicing, I'm sure eventually – 
Hey, I'm bending it already!
Wow, I can't believe you got that so quickly.  It took me two months to learn that move.
Well, you had to figure it out on your own. I'm lucky enough to have a great teacher.
Thanks.
So, what's next.
This is a more difficult move. I call it "streaming the water."
It's harder than it looks so don't be disappointed if...
Nice work, though the over-the-head flare was unnecessary.
Sorry. Well, don't stop now, keep'em coming!
Well, I kinda know this one other move, but it's pretty hard. I haven't even totally figured it out yet. The idea is to create a big, powerful wave...
So, like this?
Aang!
Looks like I got the hang of that move! What else ya got?
Yeh, I'll say!  You just practiced our supplies down the river!
Uhhh... sorry. I'm sure we can find somewhere to replace all this stuff.
We've got exactly three copper pieces left from the money that King Bumi gave us. Let's spend it wisely.
Uhh, make that two copper pieces, Sokka. I couldn't say no to this whistle!
It doesn't even work.  See, even Momo thinks it's a piece of junk.
No offense, Aang, but I'll hold the money from now on.
Sure! What are curios?
Look at this, Aang! It's a waterbending scroll. Check out these crazy moves!
Waaait a minute...sea-loving traders...with suspiciously acquired merchandise...and pet reptile birds...You guys are pirates!
So, how much for the, uh, "traded" scroll?
I know how to deal with these guys, Katara, pirates love to haggle. . Watch and learn. Aang walks over the Pirate Captain.) What say to the price of... one copper piece!
Okay – two copper pieces!
Aang, can we get out of here, I feel like we're getting weird looks.
What was that all about, Katara.
Yeh, I was just starting to browse through their boomerang collection.
Well, well, look who's come to their senses. Told ya the haggling would pay off.
I...I don't think these pirates are here to trade with us!
No thanks!
Hold on tight!
Aang, I thought we were running away from the pirates!
Just hang on!
I used to kinda look up to pirates, but those guys are terrible.
No way.
Isn't it great?
Sokka, where do you think they got it? They stole it from a waterbender.
It doesn't matter. You put all of our lives in danger just so you could learn some stupid, fancy splashes!
These are real waterbending forms. You know how crucial it is for Aang to learn waterbending.
Well, what's done is done. We have it. We might as well learn from it.
I've checked all the shops on this pier. Not a lotus tile in the entire marketplace.
Quite the contrary. I always say the only thing better than finding something you were looking for, is finding something you weren't looking for at a great bargain!
You bought a sumki horn?
For music night on the ship. Now, if we only had some woodwinds.
This place looks promising!
Ooo! That is handsome! Wouldn't it look magnificent in the galley?
I just want to try this one move first and then it's all yours. 
"The single water whip"... looks doable.
What's so funny?
I'm sorry, but you deserve that.  You've been duped. She's only interested in teaching herself.
You just gotta shift your weight through the stances...  There. See, the key to bending is...
It's okay, Katara
What about Momo? He's the real victim here.
We don't need to stop. They stole a waterbending scroll, right?
Then they'll be on the water.
Okay, Katara, shift your weight through the stances......ugh!
No, let go of me!
I'll save you from the pirates.
Tell me where he is and I won't hurt you or your brother.
Go jump in the river!
My mother's necklace! How did you get that?
I didn't steal it, if that's what you're wondering. Tell me where he is.
No!
Huh? Where did she go?  I don't believe it.
She took the scroll! She's obsessed with that thing. It's just a matter of time before she gets us all in deep –
Oh, what? I'm not good enough to kidnap?
Nice work.
Aang, this is all my fault.
No, Katara it isn't.
Yeh, it kind of is.
Give me the boy.
You're really gonna hand over the Avatar for a stupid piece of parchment!?
Shut your mouth, you water tribe peasant!
You'll regret breaking a deal with me!
Aang, are you there?
I'm over here, follow my voice!
I'm right here!
Uhh, never mind! I'll find you!
Run!
Katara! You're okay!
Help me get this boat back in the water so we can get out of here!
We need a team of rhinos to budge this ship.
A team of rhinos... or two waterbenders.
Everybody in!
Are you so busy fighting you cannot see your own ship has set sail?
We have no time for your proverbs, Uncle!
Haha!
Hey! That's my boat! 
Sokka! Can't you make it go any faster?
I don't know how. This thing wasn't made by the water tribe.
Hey, you did the water whip!
I couldn't have done it without your help!
Will you two quit congratulating each other and help me out!
Oh, no!
We can stop the boat! Aang, together, push and pull the water!
It's working! It's slowing down!
We're doing it!
I knew a bison whistle would come in handy. Thanks, Appa.
Yeh, we owe ya one.
My boat!
Aang, I still owe you an apology.  You were just so good at waterbending without really trying. I got so competitive that I put us all in danger. I'm sorry.
That's okay, Katara.
Besides, who needs that stupid scroll anyway.
Is that really how you feel?
The scroll!
First, what did you learn?
Stealing is wrong.  Unless it's from pirates!
Haha! Good one, Katara.
Um...aren't you forgetting the TARP?
Right...got it.
Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp on TOP of the tent. You know, so we don't get RAINED on.
Ordinarily you'd be right, but seeing how it's the dry season, you're not. Besides, that tarp makes a pretty warm blanket.
But what if it DOES rain?
But what if it doesn't? Then I would have put the tarp up for nothing.
Ur...arg! You're infuriating!
Katara, why don't you worry about gathering the firewood because that kindling's looking PRETTY sorry.
Well if you don't like my firewood...  have it!
Fine by me! If you're not going to do your job  ...urg!
Okay, I got the grub if you guys got the...  Hey, where's the campfire? And what happened to the tent?
Why don't you ask Miss Know It All? Queen of the Twigs!
Oh yeah?  Well you're Mister Lazy Bum, King of the  ...Tents!
Okay, listen guys. Harsh words won't solve problems, action will. Why don't you just switch jobs?
Sounds good.
Whatever.
You see that? Settling feuds and making peace. All in a days work for the Avatar.
Come on Momo, that's fair.  Appa's got FIVE stomachs.
Here it is, guys, the Great Divide.
Wow! I could just stare at it forever.
Okay. I've seen enough.
How can you not be fascinated, Sokka? This is the largest canyon in the entire world.
Then I'm sure we'll be able to see it very clearly from the air while we fly away.
Hey! If you're looking for the Canyon Guide, I was here first!
Ooooo...canyon guide. Sounds informative.
Believe me, he's more than a tour guide, he's an earthbender. And the only way in and out of the canyon is with his help. And he's takin' MY tribe across next!
Calm down, we know you're next.
You wouldn't be calm if the Fire Nation destroyed YOUR home and forced YOU to flee.  My whole tribe has to walk thousands of miles to the capital city of Ba Sing Se!
You're a refugee.
Humph. Tell me somethin' I don't know.
Is that your tribe?
It most certainly is NOT. 
That's the Zhang tribe. A bunch of low-life thieves. They've been the enemies of my tribe for 100 years.  Hey Zhangs! I'm savin' a spot for my tribe so don't even THINK of stealing it!
Yes! But they sent me ahead of them to hold a spot.
Heh! Of course you didn't. That's the ignorance I'd expect from a messy Zhang! So unorganized and ill prepared for a journey.
Um...  one of them I think.
I was here first! My party's on their way!
Wait! Here they come!
We've got old people who are weary from traveling.
Well Aang, ready to put your peace making skills to the test?
I... don't know. A fight over chores is one thing. These people have been feuding for 100 years.
Everyone, listen up!  This is the Avatar! And if you give him a chance, I'm sure he can come up with a compromise that will make everyone happy.
Uh...you could share the earthbender and travel together?
Alright! Here's the deal!  We're all going down together and Appa here will fly your sick and elderly across. Does that seem fair?
Sorry Appa. You'll have to do this on your own. 
This feuding tribe stuff is serious business. Are you sure it's a good idea getting involved in this?
To tell the truth, I'm not sure.  But when have I ever been?
He's the Avatar, Sokka. Making peace between people is his job.
His job's gonna make us cross this whole thing on foot, isn't it?
Appas's gonna take good care of you until we get there.  See ya on the other side, buddy. Yip, yip!
Nice bending!
Why'd you do that?
We gotta help him!
Okay...now you gotta help me!
What was that?
Your arms...they're broken.
...we're trapped in this canyon.
I thought the whole point of ditching our food was so we wouldn't have to deal with things like... canyon crawlers...
Look. Sticking together is the only way to...
Any ideas?
ENOUGH!  I thought I could help you guys get along, but I guess that's not going to happen. 
We should split up. Gan Jins on this side...and Zhangs on that side. We'll travel in two separate lines.
Sokka, you go with the Zhangs. And Katara, you go with the Gan Jins. See if you can figure out why they hate each other so much.
So, you guys aren't going to put up your tarps?
Exactly!
Finally, someone gets it.
You really think it'll rain?
So it was you guys who had food!
Well, I guess it's okay if everyone's doing it.  So, why does your tribe hate the Zhang so much?
Would I!?
Mm hmm!
Mmmm!
That's just terrible.  You gonna finish that?
Sure would be nice to be around one of those campfires, telling stories and laughing.  It's okay, Momo, we'll be out of here soon enough and then we can eat our weight in leechy nuts!
Nah, I'll wait for the leechy nuts.
I wish I could help these people get along, but it just seems impossible. Anyhow, I guess our biggest problem is getting out of here.
Katara, Sokka, will these people cooperate long enough to get out of the canyon?
I don't think so, Aang, the Zhang's really wronged the Gan Jins. They ambushed Jin We and stole the sacred orb.
What are you talking about?
Yeh, Katara, what are you talking about? We Jin didn't steal the orb, he was returning it to their village gate and was wrongfully punished by the Gan Jin.
Not punished enough if you ask me!
Okay! Okay! I get it! Now I need your help. Let's get everyone together at the base of the canyon wall.
Please everyone! As soon as we get out of here we can eat, and then go our separate ways, but I need you all to put your heads together and figure out a way up this cliff.
Guys! FOCUS! How many times do I have to say it? Harsh words won't solve problems, ACTION will!
You know, I take it back! Harsh words aren't so bad!
Is that... food?  Everyone smuggled food down here!?  UNBELIEVABLE! You guys put our lives in danger because you couldn't go without a snack for a day!? You are all...AWFUL!
So hungry...  is that...egg custard in that tart?
Oh no! That's a lot of canyon crawlers!
We barely survived one!
Sokka, wait! I don't care about this stupid feud! I just want us to get out of here alive.
Me too. I only took their side because they fed me.
Everybody! Watch me!  Do what I do!
Everyone! Get off!
Wait a second! Jin Wei? Wei Jin? I know those guys!
No!  I mean I really knew them. I may not look it, but I'm 112 years old. I was there a hundred years ago on the day you're talking about...
There seems to be a lot of confusion about what happened. First of all, Jin Wei and Wei Jin weren't enemies, they were brothers , twins in fact  and they were eight  and most importantly, they were just playing a game! . The sacred orb from the legend  ...that was the ball. And the eastern and western gates were the goal posts . Jin Wei had the ball and was running toward the goal when he fell and fumbled it. Win Jei didn't steal the ball, he picked it up and started running it back toward the other goal. But he stepped out of bounds , so the official put him in the penalty box, not for twenty long years, but for two short minutes. 
There was no stealing and no putting anyone in prison. Just a game. 
Nope, just a regular ball.
What about our tribe's redemption ritual?
That's what the game was called, Redemption. As soon as someone got the ball from one goal to the other everyone would yell, "redemption!"  Don't get me wrong, Wei Jin was kind of a slob and Jin Wei was a little stuffy, that much is true, but they respected each others differences enough to share the same playing field.
Good to see ya, boy! Did you miss me?
Well, you know, I try.
That's some luck you knew Jin Wei and Wei Jin.
You could call it luck.  Or, you could call it... lying!
What!?
I made the whole thing up.
You did not!  That is so wrong.
Now where's that custard tart?  I'm starving!
Uncle, why did you bring your troops down from the North?
Now that you've opened the Southern portal, we need to protect it from people who would do the spirits harm.           
I can protect it.       
I need you for something more important. There is another portal in the North. Once you open it, spirits and man will be able to move freely between the North and the South in a matter of seconds.     
But the solstice is over, how am I going to open it?      
The spiritual energy is much stronger in the North. And now that you've opened the Southern portal, your energy is stronger as well.            Korra: With both portals open, our tribes will be united again.
The world will be united again.
Ahh, I haven't felt this at peace since--      
Wahoo! 
And it's over. 
Good morning, universe!       
Bumi, please... Cover yourself.         
Well, lookee here. "Vacation Tenzin" has finally decided to join us.       
Yes, he has.  It's so nice to get to spend more time with my family. Isn't that right, my little Rohan?  And I've really enjoyed having you two around. Reminds me of all those great vacations we took as kids with Dad.
Uh, I think your memory is a little foggy. Bumi and I weren't on those great vacations. It was always just you and Dad.
No, that can't be right. What about the time he took us to Kyoshi Island to ride the elephant-koi?
Nope. We weren't there.
Hmm. Oh, remember Ember Island? Those amazing sand palaces we built on the beach?     
You mean you built. We never saw the place.
I could've sworn-
Morning, kids.        
Where's your sister?     
Ikki, about this tall, talks real fast. I'm sure you know her.     
Jinora, were you and Meelo teasing your sister again?      
I don't know.  Maybe.  Yes.             
Honestly, I don't know why you kids can't just get along! 
It's all right, dear. Ikki couldn't have gone far.  I'll find her.         
Commander Bumi reporting for duty! Search-and-rescue missions are my specialty.           
What do you say we all go together?       
Sure. I could use the help.      
When I get back, we'll come up with a plan to take down that shark-squid once and for all.           
Thank you for coming, everyone. I know these last few days have been very troubling.       
Troubling?  Troubling is when I get that itchy rash that won't go away and Zhu Li's not around to scratch it. This is shocking.  Nay, sickening!  But these kale cookies? Opposite.  Remind me to get the recipe later.
What's your point, Varrick?  
My point is, Unalaq's already booted our chieftains out of their palace. How long before he starts telling us what kind of cookies we can eat? 
Rhetorical question, Zhu Li, you gotta keep up. Not to mention I've got a cargo ship full of halibut that's rotting, thanks to this harbor lockdown. Who wants to buy a ship full of stinking fish!?  Seriously, it's not rhetorical. I need to sell these fish.
Chief Unalaq is here to help the South. He wants to show us how to restore balance with the spirits so they'll stop attacking.      
The only spirit I'm interested in restoring is our spirit of independene! Am I right, people? 
All Unalaq is trying to do is make our tribes unified again.
No, he wants control of our wealth. My wealth. And I like my wealth. If Unalaq doesn't pull his forces out, then we have no choice but to fight for our freedom!  
You want to start a war? Are you crazy?         
Unalaq started this, not us. I'm sorry. Maybe you could speak with your uncle. Tell him how frustrated we all are. He'll listen to what the Avatar has to say. Do it for me?
I'll do it for the tribe.
I cannot stop eating these things.  Look, we all know where this conflict is heading. We need to start preparing for war.
I will hate to leave this quaint tribe.          
Is that true, Eska?      
Of course not, Desna. I will not miss it at all. I hold immense dislike for the South.  Bolin! Laugh at my humorous quip.      
Yes, dear.  So... so funny.
You know, I'll be really sad when you have to leave. It's been really great getting to know you. Really.               
But you will be coming with me to the North. There we will live the rest of our lives together in icy bliss. Foolish Bolin.         
Mako! I'm so happy to see you!    
Uh, you all right, bro?       
No! No, I'm not all right! I can't take anymore. Listen, I don't want to live in icy bliss with Eska! Don't make me! Oh, please, please don't make me. 
Uh, hey, if you're that unhappy, just break up with her.     
Break up with her? You can do that?        
Yeah. Guys do it all the time.    
How?             
Just tell her you're not that into her anymore.     
Oh, no, no, I don't think she'd like that.        
Ending a relationship is kind of like pulling off a bloodsucking leech. You just gotta rip it off and get it over with. You'll feel a lot better afterwards. Trust me.
Thanks, Mako. Whew. I'm lucky you're so good at breaking girls' hearts. Korra better watch out.  Ooh, no, it's just a- Uh, you kn- Uh, never mind.         
Our next training session isn't until tomorrow.      
I'm sorry to interrupt. It's about our conversation this morning.          
Yes?             
I understand why you brought your troops here, but I'm afraid it's sending the wrong message.          
Your father has been talking to you.             
Not just him, Varrick too. There was a meeting at my parents' house. A lot of Southerners feel like their tribe is being invaded.           
I am their chief. I'm uniting, not invading.          
I know, but I'm just afraid if something doesn't change, there could be a civil war.          
If the water tribes were at war, the other nations would take sides. The dark spirits would thrive off this negative energy, and the world would be thrown into a battle between spirits and man. That would be catastrophic.
How do we stop it?
We? No, Korra. This is a war only the Avatar can prevent.
I'm usually the one starting fights. I don't know how to stop them from happening.         
As the Avatar, you must remain neutral in this conflict. You will naturally want to help your people, but showing favoritism will not help our tribes find unity.
Maybe Tenzin was right. Maybe I'm not ready to be the Avatar.
Tenzin lacked faith in you.  But I have no doubt you will become the most admired Avatar the world has ever known.
Thank you, Uncle.       
Stop!             
Everyone, calm down. You're all part of the same tribe. Start acting like it.      
I'm not taking anyone's side.  Hey!              
Everyone, walk away from this. They're not worth our trouble. Go back to your homes. 
Korra, I- Korra!
Ikki! Ikki! Ikki? Ikki, where are you?             
Over here, dad!  Just kidding, it's me!       
There's no sign of her anywhere.        
Why would Ikki run off like this?  Ah, it's probably my fault.   
Probably.        
Excuse me?          
I'm guessing you've been so busy with your "duty" to Republic City that you forgot about your duty to your kids.          
Duty. 
What are you, five years old?         
Kya, you're right. I haven't been spending enough time with them I wish I could be as good a father as Dad was to us.           
Tenzin, your problem is you're exactly like Dad. He was so focused on saving the world and doing his duty - don't laugh - that he never had time for us.             
Dad was under a lot of pressure.          
He always had time for you though,  his precious little airbender. 
Dad loved us all equally. Besides, it all happened a long time ago. Why are we even talking about this?           
Because you seem to have some grandiose delusion that we had a perfect, happy-go-lucky childhood. Guess what? We didn't.              
We need to keep moving if we want to find Ikki before dark. 
See what he's doing there, Bumi? Classic airbender technique; Cutting and running when things get tough!     
Ugh.             
Yeah, did Dad teach you that move? 
How was your day, sweetie?  
Oh, fabulous. My tribe's about to go to war and I'm supposed to stop it, but will anyone listen to me? No! And I didn't ask for my father's help. Can't he just let me be the Avatar?
Uh... do you want advice, or am I just supposed to listen? I'm still not clear on that.
Ugh. I'm sorry. My Dad just gets me all worked up.
How about you take a break from all this Avatar stuff and we go out for a quiet dinner? Just the two of us.       
Isn't this fun, huh? We never get to spend enough time together, just the... five of us. So fun.
Excuse us while we retrieve more sustenance.
You guys gotta save me.       
I thought you were breaking up with her. What happened to ripping off the leech?       
I tried! But anytime I bring up the subject, she threatens to freeze me in a block of ice and feed me to dolphin-piranhas!      
So it was more like you tugged at the leech.    
Yes, over and over and over, but it won't come off. Why didn't you warn me your cousin had the power to reach into my heart and crush my soul with her bare hands?
Uh... 'cos I thought it was pretty obvious?
No, no, not to me, it wasn't. I'm very bad at reading people. You should know that by now. Oh, man. Oh... Do something, Avatar!      
You know, this reminds me of a search-and-rescue mission I commanded years ago, in the mountains outside of Ba Sing Se.         
Here we go.           
For five days, we scoured that beast of a mountain, fighting our way through blizzards, sandstorms, and three typhoons. Finally, we found the men huddled in a cave, seconds from death.  With no time to lose, I piled all twelve of those poor souls on my back and single-handedly carried them down the mountain to safety.
And how exactly is that supposed to help us find Ikki!? 
It was supposed to inspire you. Clearly, you know nothing about being a leader of men. That's probably why the Avatar fired you.
I'm sick of your far-fetched tales. Three typhoons?         
Well, I may have thrown in an extra typhoon or two for dramatic effect, but-      
Quit arguing and bring that lantern over here. I found footprints!       
Come on!           
No, follow me! This will get us down fifty times faster.        
Bumi, it's pitch black and the rocks are slippery. You're gonna hurt yourself.   
Come on, you wimps! If I can do it, it should be no problem for a couple of benders.    
Fine.                  
You were right, Bumi! That was faster!        
At least fifty times faster, by my calculations.          
Oh, Tenzin's the funny guy now.          
If you need an airlift down, just say the word.          
Bah, I don't need your help. I've got everything under control. Ahh!              
Bumi!
Did Dad send you to talk to me?         
Your father doesn't know I'm here. Korra, what's going on between you two?
Ask Dad.              
I've tried, but he won't talk about it. Honey, it breaks my heart to see our family being torn apart like this.   
You want to know what's been going on? I found out Dad's been lying to me my whole life. Unalaq told me everything; How Dad and Tenzin kept me trapped down here while I trained. How dad got banished from the North.
So, the truth is out.     
You knew. And you never said anything.  
We were trying to keep our family together, to give you a normal childhood.       
I never wanted a normal childhood. All I ever wanted to be was the Avatar but everyone keeps holding me back, even my own parents! Unalaq's the only one who believes in me.
That's not true, Korra.       
No? Then why is everyone in the South turning against me, when all I'm trying to do is help them?          
The problems between the North and the South started long before you were born. You can't expect to undo them in a day.               
So I should just sit back and let the water tribes go to war?              
No, but this situation might be out of your control. Varrick's been plotting rebellion against Unalaq. He asked your father to join, and-       Korra:  Dad is part of a rebellion?  
I don't know, but I don't want you getting caught in the middle of it.      
It's too late, Mom. I'm already in the middle of it.      
Korra!            
Uncle!  Oh, no. Uncle?                        
Dad?
Dad, don't do this.
No. Leave Unalaq and go. I'll tell him I tried to stop you but you escaped. We can still avoid a war.         
We're all part of the same tribe! I don't want to hurt you.                
Dad, stop!  
Why did you do this, Dad?  What? Who are you? Where's my father?          
He wouldn't help us. He's a traitor, just like you.                
Thank you for saving my life.            
I'm just glad I got here in time.       
Find Varrick. I want him to freeze in prison with the rest of these traitors.
Wait, you can't just lock them away. That will only make the South angrier.          
You want them to go free?   
No... but let them stand trial for what they did. Every Water Tribe citizen deserves that right.      
Very well. I will respect the Avatar's wishes in this matter.     
Thank you, Uncle.       
I told you those rocks were slippery. You're lucky you didn't kill yourself.       
You done with the lecture, Mom?     
Oh, grow up. You haven't changed one bit since we were kids. You're still trying to prove you can do everything a bender can. Well, you can't. Deal with it.
And you're not our mother, you don't get to tell me what I can and can't do. Deal with that. Ugh!
Good luck healing yourself with your special non-bending powers.       
Hey back me up here, Tenzin.             
Kya's right. You're the oldest of us, but you always acted like the youngest. I had to become the responsible one.
You think you're the responsible one? Where were you after Dad died and Mom was all alone? Because I was the only one who packed up and moved my whole life to be with her.         
Sure, after years of flitting around the world, trying to find yourself. It was time for you to settle down somewhere. You two have no idea how it feels to have the future of an entire culture on your shoulders.
Oh, boo-hoo. Must've been real hard for you, flying around the world with Dad, riding elephant-koi all day.
Oh, so that's what this is all about.          
That's what it's always been about. You think you're some savior who has to carry on Dad's legacy.          
Who else is going to do it?  
How about all of us?     
We never should have come on this vacation.           
I couldn't agree more.    
Well, I didn't want you to come in the first place.  I can't be around you two right now. Go back to the temple and see if Ikki returned. I'll keep looking out here.
Fine.             
Fine.             
Fine.
Is it okay if I come in?      
Of course. We heard what happened, are you okay?          
I'm so glad you weren't there. I don't know what I would have done.     
I had no idea how far Varrick was willing to go. My brother and I have our differences but I would never attack him.  
I'm sorry for thinking you had anything to do with the rebels, and for all the pain I've caused you and Mom.    
I'm the one who should apologize. After I saw The Southern Lights return, I was so proud of you. I never should have held you back.     Senna: When your father and I found each other, all we wanted was to live a simple life and raise a family. But then we discovered you were the Avatar, and simple was over. We knew one day the world would need you, and you wouldn't need us anymore.            
Mom, Dad, of course I still need you.   
We weren't expecting you.
Tonraq, Senna, you are under arrest and will stand trial.      
Trial? For what?          
For conspiring to assassinate me.
You're early.
What can I say? I'm pumped up to learn that Unalaq spirit fighting.
I'm not here to teach you to fight spirits. I'm here to help you begin your spiritual training. We're going to one of the most remote places in the world, the long neglected spiritual center of your tribe: The South Pole.
You're gonna train me at the South Pole?
We will do more than just train. By neglecting the spirits, the people of the South have brought darkness upon themselves and now it threatens to destroy our tribe. We must set things right. The Southern Water Tribe depends on you.
A dangerous trip to the South Pole? Count me in.
There it is, The Southern Air Temple. Isn't it magnificent?
Good to see you again, Abbot Shung.
No, thank you. I'm fine.
Oh... Okay.
That's... sweet? You- you didn't have to.
No! That gift is mine.
You don't even like to read.
Naah.
Yep, those are the world's next generation of airbenders.
Ugh. Phew. Excuse me, a little help here?
We're Tenzin's brother and sister.
We're not airbenders.
I thought you said Bolin was coming.
He said he'd be here, but I can't worry about it, I have to make sure you have everything you need for a safe trip.
Thanks Captain Expedition, but I'll be fine.
Tonraq, what do you want?
I heard you're taking Korra to the South Pole. I'm coming.
Absolutely not. You're a distraction to Korra and a hindrance to what needs to be done.
My daughter is not going without me. She needs someone to watch after her.
Dad, why do you always think you know what's best for me?
Because he's misguided. The sad truth is it's men like your father who have put the Spirit World out of balance. He's ignored my warnings in the past and hasn't learned since.
What happened in the past?
It doesn't matter. What matters is The Everstorm.
The Everstorm?
It's a massive blizzard that's battered the South Pole for decades.  I'm coming, unless you think you can stop me.
Guys! Hey, wait for meee! Check it out, I'm traveling in style.  Whoa! Okay, I'm sorry... Still getting used to that throttle.
Uh, where'd you get the ride?
Varrick. He's awesome. He also gave me this fancy snowsuit. It's inflatable with an internal heater, emergency beacon, and food ration pouch. I mean, if I get lost, I can survive in this thing for like... like a month.  Who wants some freeze-dried cucumber-quats? Nobody? Did I interrupt a conversation? 
No, the conversation is over. Dad, come if you want. Just don't interfere with my training.
Does this sidecar have the capacity for two passengers?
Sure does. But uh, who's gonna drive?
Well, what do you know? Looks like-
Go away, Mako.
So once we get to the South Pole, then what happens?
You will open  an ancient spirit portal.
I'm sorry, what now?
At the South Pole, there is a portal that connects our world to the Spirit World but it has long been closed.
And that's why the evil spirits are attacking?
There are no "evil spirits". There is light and dark in them all.  But when they're unbalanced, the darkness takes over. If you can open the portal in time, balance will be restored.
What do you mean "in time"?
There's a reason the Glacier Spirits Festival ends on the Winter Solstice. That's when the Spirit World and the physical world are close together. Only then can the Avatar open the portal.
The Winter Solstice is tomorrow.
Exactly. And we can't afford to wait another year.
Easy, Naga.
What are those?
Dark spirits.
Let's keep moving, we have to find a safe place to set up camp.
Uncle, why do you think the dark spirits are following us?
Can we not talk about dark spirits, please? 
My brother doesn't like ghost stories.
Don't worry. I will protect you, my feeble turtle-duck.
Thank you.
Sadly, this isn't a ghost story. This is real.
The spirits are angry because he's here.  Haven't you ever wondered how your father ended up in the South Pole? Why he's never taken you to visit his homeland in the North?
Unalaq, this is not the time.
You're right. You should have told her a long time ago.
Told me what?
I left the North Pole because... I was banished.
You were banished from the North? Why?
Because I almost destroyed the entire tribe.  20 years ago, I was a general in the Northern Water Tribe, sworn to protect my people.
I drove them out of the city and deep into the frozen tundra.
We tracked them deep into an ancient forest.  Many believed this forest was the home to spirits. And the barbarians retreated there because they thought we wouldn't attack on such hallowed grounds.  They thought wrong.
We captured the barbarians, but in the process we destroyed the forest.  I didn't realize the consequences of what I had done.
By destroying the forest, I unknowingly let loose angry spirits.
They threatened  to destroy everything. The entire city.
Unalaq was able to guide the spirits back to the forest. But by then, the damage had been done.  For being the cause of so much devastation, my father banished me from the Northern Water Tribe in shame.  That's when I came to the South and started a new life.
Whoaaa. So you were supposed to be chief, then he became chief. No wonder you guys don't like each other.  Ow! What? Isn't that what happened?
I can't believe you kept this from me.
I was protecting you from the shame I brought on the family.
Why do you keep hiding things from me and then telling me it's for my own protection? I'm tired of you protecting me! 
Korra.
Wow. The statue room.
That's right, Jinora. The most sacred place in the entire Southern Air Temple. Here you will find statues of every Avatar who ever lived.  Where are your brother and sister?
You can't catch me. I'm the greatest air-scooter-er of all time. Oof!
Meelo!
Korra, you have every right to be mad at me but I don't want you to make the same mistake I made. I should have never gone into that forest. And we shouldn't be going to the South Pole now. Spirits and the physical world should remain separate.
Dad, it's my job to be the bridge between the spirits and the physical world and I finally have a chance to live up to my potential.
You don't even know if what Unalaq says is true.
You want proof? Look to the sky. Where I'm from, the spirits are at peace and they light up the dark.
The Northern Lights.
Yes. There used to be lights in the South as well but during the hundred year war, the South was thrown out of balance and the lights disappeared. When the war ended, the North helped to rebuild you physically as a nation but we have not rebuilt you spiritually. Now the spirits no longer dance in your skies. Instead, they rampage in the Everstorm.
I think we're here.
Is that what I think it is?
We must keep moving.
Oh man. I really don't like this.
Bolin, just stay calm. There's no reason to- Panic!
Aah!
Korra, look out!
Oh, it's in the engine!
Is everyone okay?
I can't stop it!
I'll save you.
I'm a raft!
Uh... can someone please deflate me?  Thank you.
Oh great, there goes our equipment. Now what are we supposed to do?
There's only one thing to do. We have to turn back.
No. The solstice is tonight, we're so close.
This mission is too dangerous, we're leaving.
No Dad, you're leaving.
Don't worry, sir. I'll keep an eye on Korra for you.
Thank you, Mako.
Let's open this portal and lead your father and the entire Southern Water Tribe in the right direction. We don't have much time.
Then what are we waiting for?
So what exactly were you and my dad talking about?
Nothing. He was just worried about you, that's all.
You know, sometimes I wonder whose side you're on.
There aren't any sides. We all just want to help however we can. You have to trust that we're here for you.
We've arrived.
Trees frozen in ice.
It's just like the sacred forest Tonraq destroyed in the North.
So what do I do?
You must find your way to the heart of the forest where the dormant spirit portal lies. From here, you're on your own.
Wait a second, there's no way she's going alone.
Yeah, if she goes, we go too. 
The Avatar must go alone.
But I don't have any connection with the spirits. In fact, it seems like they hate me.
You have to believe in yourself like I believe in you.  What is it?
I guess I'm just so used to people telling me how to do things that I forgot what it was like to have someone trust in me.
Korra, all the past Avatars live on inside of you. Let them guide you. Let them help you find the light in the dark.
Wait here. I'll be okay.
Good luck.
The spirit portal. Amazing.
What Avatar is this?
The light in the dark.
Why isn't it opening?
Come on, portal. Open!
The spirits dancing in the sky.
I can't believe it.
It's beautiful.
She did it.
Hey Korra, you're back! Hey, Korra's back! Wha- huh?
Why are you initiating physical contact with another woman?
Everything you said was true.
Avatar Korra, you have taken the first step in bringing balance back to the South and soon, the whole world.
You never cease to amaze me.
Thanks. By the way, I'm really sorry for being a total pain. Things were really stressful and confusing. It's hard being the Avatar.  Mako: It's harder being the Avatar's boyfriend.
What are all your Northern troops doing here?
Opening the spirit portal was only the first step in getting the Southern Water Tribe back on its righteous path. There's more difficult work to be done before our two tribes are truly united.
You're finally here!  Welcome to Air Temple Island!  Your new home! 
Yes, welcome to my domain! 
Well aren't you sweet,  little monk child?
What's that fuzzy creature? 
That is a Fire Ferret.  An arboreal mammal common  to the bamboo forests of the central Earth Kingdom.
He's cuuute! 
Yip yip! Fly, sky bison, fly! 
Thanks for sending the air acolytes to help us with the move.
Yes, they've been amazing!  Such tireless workers.
Oh, I thought you were only bringing a few  things? 
Trust me,  it could have been worse.
No problem. Everyone here wants you guys to feel welcome.
You're pretty,  can I have some of your hair?
Looks like  I have some competition.
And now for the grand tour!  The flying bison sleep in those caves down there,  and that's the temple Grandpa Aang built,  and that's the greenhouse where we grow the vegetables we eat! 
I have a couple questions.  Is this an all vegetarian island?  Is that where you train airbending?  Do we have to wear Air Acolyte clothes?  Do we each get our own sky bison?  And  final question, how many trees  are on this island? 
Yes, yes, no, no, ten thousand five hundred and fifty-two.
So where are we going to be staying? 
You're a boy, boys have to stay on the boys' side. 
I'd  be happy to show you to the men's dormitory. 
I'm a boy! 
Meelo, why don't you go with the boys too?
We shall meet again soon, beautiful woman. 
Ikki and I will take you to your room this way.
Asami,  did you know Korra likes Mako?
Oh, uh, no, I wasn't completely aware of that.
Hey!
Run along, Ikki! 
So...  here's your room!  I know this is a little rustic compared to what you're used to...
I think it's really charming.  And the best part about it? Nothing here reminds me of my father. Thank you for your hospitality.
Ikki, I swear,  if you don't leave us alone I'm gonna-  Uh, Tenzin! Come right in! 
Good day, ladies. Asami, welcome to the island. 
Thank you for having me.
It was an honour, serving under chief Bei Fong for so many years,  and I wish her a speedy recovery. It is with great humility that I take her place as the new chief of police.  Republic City is facing a threat like none the world has ever seen, but there is one man who has been effective against Amon's revolution.  Councilman Tarrlok!  That is why,  for all matters involving the Equalists,  I will report directly to him.  The police department  will lend any and all available resources  to the councilman and his task force, until we  quell this insurgency! 
What is that weasel-snake Tarrlok up to now?
Tarrlok,  I don't know what you did to get Chief Saikhan in your pocket, but I highly doubt it was legal. 
Oh, Tenzin. Always the conspiracy theorist. Did you ever consider Saikhan simply recognizes my talents  and wants what is best for this city?  Well, Avatar Korra, long time no see. Now that your little Pro-Bending distractions are over, I look forward  to your return to my task force.
Huh, forget it! There's no way I'm rejoining your vanity project.
That is unfortunate to hear. But I'm sure you'll come to your senses as you have in the past.
Don't hold your breath, bub. Y'know,  Tenzin's been right about you all along. You played me,  you played Bei Fong, and now you're playing   the new Chief of Police too.  Well I've got news for you,  you need me, but I  don't need you. I'm the Avatar.
You're not, in fact,  the Avatar.  You are merely a half-baked Avatar in training. Which reminds me, how is your  airbending going?  Made any significant progress with that?  I...  didn't think so. If you will not be part of my task force,  then you had best stay out of my way.
I don't understand what's wrong with me!  I've memorized nearly all the practice forms but I still can't produce a single measly puff of air! I'm a failure.
No you're not.  You just need to work through this airbending block.
Amazing advice, I'll get right on that!
I wasn't finished yet. You see, Aang not only had his bending teachers but  also his past lives to call upon for guidance.  Have you ever made contact with your past lives?
No, of course I haven't! Didn't you get the memo from the White Lotus? I'm a spiritual failure too.
You may have made a connection without realizing it.  Perhaps, something you mistook as a dream?
Maybe... I had a few weird hallucinations...  but I hardly even remember them.
And did you see any of the previous avatars in these visions?
I saw Aang... it seemed like he was in trouble. What do you think it means?
Hm. I don't know.  But I urge you to meditate on these visions.  I believe Aang's spirit must be trying to tell you something.
Korra?  You out here? 
Kooorrraaa!  There you are.  Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Come on, what's wrong? You can tell us.
How am I  supposed to save the city when I can't even learn airbending? I'm the worst avatar ever! I just feel...alone.
No that's nonsense, you are amazing! 
Yeah, and remember, Aang hadn't mastered all of the elements when he was battling the Fire Nation. He was just a little kid!
And he wasn't alone!  He had his friends to help him. Look,  the arena might be shut down, but we're still a team,  the new Team Avatar! 
We got your back Korra,  and we can save the city, together! 
Yeah, let's do it!
Yeah, let's do it!  What are we doing? 
Get ready, Republic City.  You  are about to be patrolled by Team Avatar. 
Asami, you always know how to accessorize your outfits.
I figure one way to fight Equalists is to use an Equalist weapon. 
All right.  Let's ride. 
Naga away! 
All right, scratch that. Any other ideas?
Hm,  I think I have the answer. 
You think this'll do?
I like the new Team Avatar style.
My dad had police scanners installed in all of his cars. I guess now I know why.
Whoa. 
Chi-blockers! 
That's them! 
Let's get 'em!
Korra, Bolin! Give me a ramp!  Now! 
Help me out, we've gotta make this turn!  They don't know we made the turn. Okay, get ready...
Avatar Korra, what do you think you're doing?
Oh, hey, Tarrlok! Nice of you to show up, finally.  Here, we captured the escaped convicts for you.
What you did was tear up the city and impede the real authorities in their pursuit of these criminals.
Hm, that's funny, I didn't see your little task force or the cops the whole time! If it wasn't for Team Avatar, they would have gotten away.
This is your last warning! Stay out of my way. 
Republic City stands as a beacon of freedom. But the Equalists are using that freedom to tear it down.  The law I have proposed would make it illegal for anyone to be a member of the Equalists, or even be associated with them. It also puts into effect a curfew, ensuring all nonbenders are in their own homes by nightfall.
This is going too far, Tarrlok!  You can't punish all nonbenders for the actions of a few! 
That kind of cowardice will cause our city to fall into Amon's hands. We must pass this law. All in favour?
I call front! 
After you.
What a gentleman,  thanks!
Why is the power out? 
Wait a second, these people aren't armed or dangerous.
Sure doesn't look that way.
All nonbenders, return to your homes immediately!
Disperse, or you will all be arrested!
Mommy, look! It's the Avatar!
Everyone please stay calm. I'm gonna put a stop to this! 
Tarrlok!  You need to turn the power back on and leave these people alone!
Avatar Korra, you and your playmates have no business here!
We're not going anywhere! You don't have the right to treat these innocent people like criminals. 
This is an Equalist rally.  There's nothing innocent about it.
They're not Equalists. They're just normal people who want their rights back.
They are the enemy!  Round up all these Equalists!
Stop!
Hey, let me go! 
You're under arrest! 
What? You can't do that! 
Actually I can. She's a nonbender out past curfew and her father is a known Equalist conspirator.
Let her go! 
Arrest him, and his brother! 
Tarrlok!
Unless you want to join your friends in prison, I suggest you put those down and go back to the Air Temple.
Korra, listen to him! It's not worth it.
We'll be all right!
Don't worry, I'll call Tenzin! He can get you out!
So sad to see your little Team Avatar  broken up. You had a good run.
This isn't over, Tarrlok!
Oh, I believe it is. Take them away!
Hey! Ugh!
I came as fast as I could. Are your friends all right?
I don't know, these knuckleheads won't tell me anything!
I'll take care of this.  Saikhan, a word please.
Councilman Tenzin. I'm pretty swamped at the moment. Can this wait? 
No it cannot. Three of Avatar Korra's friends were wrongly arrested tonight. I'd like you to release them immediately.
They're not going anywhere. They were interfering with police business.
Your so-called police business was rounding up innocent people and claiming they were Equalists! They should be released too!
All Equalist suspects are being detained indefinitely. They will be freed if and when the task force deems they are no longer a threat.
Those people are titled to due process under the law!
You'll have to take that up with Councilman Tarrlok.
Oh I plan to. At the council meeting, first thing in the morning.
You're officially the worst Chief of Police ever!
Calm down, Korra, I'll get this sorted out, we just need to be patient.  But you really are the worst!  Ever! 
Wake up Naga. Let's go.  Wait for me here, girl.  Don't worry, I'll be all right.  You and I need to talk.
Are any of the other council members here?
Then you should do the same.
Leave us.  You obviously have something on your mind. Spit it out.
Don't you see? You're doing exactly what Amon says is wrong with benders! You're using your power to oppress and intimidate people! 
And you don't?
Of... of course not! 
Isn't that what you came here to do? Intimidate me into releasing your friends?  See, that's what I admire about you, Korra. Your willingness to go to extremes in order to get what you want. It is a quality we both share.
You and I are nothing alike! 
Look, I'll make you a deal. You fall in line, and do what I say, and I'll release your friends.
That's why you arrested them? To get to me?
I need your answer.
No. You might be able to manipulate Chief Saikhan into following you, but it won't work on me.
You will regret that decision.
You need to be stopped! You're just as bad as Amon! 
I've tried to work with you, Korra. But you've made it impossible.
Still think I'm a half-baked Avatar?  What are you gonna do now? You're all out of water, pal!
You're in my way, Avatar, and you need to be removed!
You're... you're a... bloodbender?
Very observant. 
Itís... not a full moon how... how are you doing this?
There are a lot of things you don't know about me.
Where are you taking me?
Somewhere where no one will find you. Say goodbye to Republic City, Avatar Korra! You'll never see it again.
You can't do this! Let me out!
Although the Hundred Year War has long passed, we are not living in a time of peace. These revolutionaries who call themselves "Equalists" are not interested in equality at all. They just want to wage war against benders. Chief Bei Fong was supposed to protect Republic City, but she was powerless to stop Amon's attack on the arena. She has failed us all. If we are to survive these dire times, our law enforcement needs new leadership.
I still don't believe they're shutting this place down. 
Yeah, we had some good memories here, didn't we?
Guys, great news.  You don't have to go back on the streets. I talked to Tenzin and made all the arrangements. You can come live on Air Temple Island with me.
Oh, we'd love to, but-
Asami already invited us to live in her dad's giant mansion!  From here on out , it's going to be the lap of luxury for us.
Hey, Korra.  I was hoping you'd stop by. 
I was just leaving. So... I guess I'll see you guys around... some time.
Why not tomorrow? I'd love to have you come visit the estate.
I don't know. I have some Avatar stuff to do.
Come on, Korra. We all deserve a little rest and relaxation after all this craziness. We could swim in Asami's pool. It'll be fun!
All right, Pabu.
Great, we'll see you tomorrow.
Looks like our intel was good.
There's enough evidence here to bury Cabbage Corp for an eternity.
This is an outrage, I'm innocent!
Yeah, yeah. That's what they all say.
Is it true that Cabbage Corp is conspiring with the Equalists?
The evidence points in that direction, but the investigation is ongoing. For the time being we have frozen Mr. Gan-Lan's assets and are closing Cabbage Corp.
No, not my Cabbage Corp!
Hey, Korra. 
Tahno?  Listen. I know we're not exactly "best friends," but I'm sorry Amon took your bending.
I've been to the best healers in the city. Whatever Amon did to me, it's permanent.  You gotta get him for me.
Mr. Sato, if you remember anything else about what you saw during Amon's attack, be sure to let us know.
I'm happy to help any way I can. I want these Equalists to pay for what they've done.
We're ready for you now.
See you around, Avatar.
Earthbending bomb! 
Avatar Korra has arrived.
Hey, Korra.
Glad you made it.
Welcome to paradise. 
Looks like you guys settled right in.
Pretty much, except someone forgot to ask her father if we could stay here.
Yeah, but I smoothed it over with him. It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.
This is the greatest place in the world. Watch this.  Fetch me my towel, good sir.
Yes, Master... Bolin. 
"Master Bolin."  I love this guy. Now pat me dry.
As you wish. 
Don't forget Master Pabu.
Wouldn't dream of it, Sir.
So, what do you have planned for us today?  Let me guess: shopping, makeovers?
Ooh, Ooh! I vote makeovers! 
I have something a little more exciting in mind.
Pretty cool, huh?
Way cooler than a makeover.
This is where Future Industries test drives their Satomobiles. Ever been behind the wheel?
The only thing I know how to drive is a polar bear dog
You want me to take you for a spin?
Let's do it.
Woohoo!
That was amazing! I didn't think we'd make it.
Well, you can't be afraid to mix it up sometimes.
I gotta admit I had you pegged wrong. I thought you were kind of prissy.  No offense.
It's all right. People usually assume that I'm daddy's helpless little girl, but I can handle myself. I mean, I've been in self defense classes since I was this high.  My dad made sure I would always be able to protect myself.
Smart guy.
Emergency! Emergency, coming through! Beep, beep! 
Uh, is there another bathroom I can use?
We have a ladies' powder room upstairs. First door on your right.  You can freshen up in there.
Thanks.
No, no, I assure you. Everything is going exactly as planned.  Mhhm, yes. Luckily the Cabbage Corp investigation has bought us enough time.  Trust me. By the end of the week, we'll be ready to strike.
You're leaving? But I-I thought-
Sorry, I forgot I'm supposed to airsit, I mean babybend, I-I mean babysit the airbender kids. See you later.
So you think Mr. Sato manufactured those gloves for the Equalists, then framed Cabbage Corp?
That's a bold accusation, but what proof do you have?
Well I don't exactly have proof, but I know what I heard. Sato's up to something.
He does have the means... and he has a motive.
That's right.
A motive? What is it?
Twelve years ago, the Agni Kai Triad robbed Sato's mansion.  A firebender killed Sato's wife during the break-in.
That's terrible.
It was tragic. It's possible he's been harboring anti-bending sentiment all this time.
Maybe we should look at Mr. Sato a little more closely.
What's going on? Why are they asking Hiroshi more questions?
I overheard him on the phone yesterday. Asami, I don't know how to tell you this, but I think your father might be involved with the Equalists.
What? I don't believe this. 
You spied on Hiroshi? What's your problem?
Mr. Sato, we just have a few follow-up questions for you.
My father is innocent. Just because we're not benders doesn't mean we support those awful Equalists!
Equalists? Is that what this is about? I can assure you I have nothing to do with those radicals.
Yeah, you don't know what you're talking about, Korra.
I overheard you on the phone. You said the Cabbage Corp investigation bought you time and you're getting ready to strike. Explain that.
This is all just a misunderstanding. Resulting from the young Avatar's overactive imagination. My number one competitor was knocked out of the game. It's providing me an opportunity to strike the market with a new line of Satomobiles. It's just business, nothing nefarious.
In order to put all suspicions to rest, might we have a look into your factories and warehouses?
If you feel it's necessary, you're welcome to search all of Future Industries.
Is it possible presidents of Cabbage Corp and Future Industries both have Equalist ties?  Or did Hiroshi Sato frame his long time rival, Lau Gan-Lan? Or did Chief Bei Fong just plain arrest the wrong man?  So far the investigation has yielded no evidence to incriminate Sato. 
I can't believe we didn't find anything.
It would appear Hiroshi is innocent.
Okay. You did your search. Now you can all leave.
So, I hope you're convinced now.
No, I'm not. I don't care how cooperative Hiroshi is being, I know he's lying.
Why are you doing this?  Are you that jealous of me and Asami?
What? Don't be ridiculous. That has nothing to do with it.
If you don't drop this, consider our friendship over.
I'm sorry.  Hiroshi is not the man you think he is.
I think you guys should hear this.  "If you want to find the truth, meet me under the north end of the Silk Road Bridge at midnight."
Psst! Over here.  Listen. I joined the Equalists because I believed in what Amon said.  I thought he could make life better for us non-benders. But I didn't sign up for this, this war.
What do you have on Hiroshi Sato?
He manufactured those gloves for the Equalists.
I knew it.
And there are rumors he's working on something even bigger. Some new kind of weapon.
We searched all of Future Industries and found nothing.
That's because he has a secret factory.
Where?
It's right underneath the Sato mansion.
Raiding the Sato mansion is a risky move with Tarrlok breathing down your neck. If we're wrong-
I know. I can kiss my job goodbye. But protecting Republic City is all I care about. We can't let Amon get his hands on this new weapon.
What are you doing here? 
We have reason to believe there is a factory hidden beneath the mansion.
I think I would have noticed if there were a factory underneath my house!  The lies you people come up with just to persecute my father.
Where is your father?
In his workshop, behind the house.
Dad? Hello?
Chief, the estate's been secured. No one has left the workshop since we arrived.
Perhaps we just couldn't see him leaving.  There's a tunnel beneath the workshop, running deep into the mountain side.
What?  There's no tunnel.
Do you think your dad knows about this tunnel?
I don't understand. There must be an explanation
Maybe you don't know everything about your father. I'm sorry.
Officers, into the tunnel. Be cautious.  Uh-uh. You three stay up here. Officer Song, keep an eye on them.
Not your average backyard workshop.
And I'm guessing those are the new weapons.
Hiroshi was lying all right, but where is he?
What was that?
We need to get down there and see what's going on.
Absolutely not. You're staying put until the chief comes back.
All right, we'll stay put. But can we wait outside or something? It's so dusty in this workshop. 
No. We're waiting right here.
Okay, but don't blame me if I start snee... if I start snee... if I start...
What's your problem, bub?
I'm about to-
Sorry, pal. We know you were just doing your job.
Yeah.  Just stay put until the chief come back.  That sounds very familiar, doesn't it? Why? Because you said it.
Asami, you should stay here. We'll check it out.
I have to find out the truth about my father.
I understand. That's why I'm going down; to find out for you. Please.
All right.  Be careful.
I'm afraid you won't be able to metalbend that wall, Chief Bei Fong.  It's solid platinum. My mechatanks are platinum as well.  Not even your renowned mother could bend a metal so pure.
Hiroshi, I knew you were a lying. no-good Equalist. Come out here and-
And do what, young Avatar? Face the wrath of your bending? No. I think I'll from inside here, where my odds are a little more... equal. 
That source was a set-up. You lured us down here.
Guilty as charged.
Korra!
Well, I'd say that was a near flawless test run.  Load everyone into the transports and deliver them to Amon!
Oh no.
Korra was right! We gotta do something, quick!
Not so fast, boys.
Hello, Mr. Sato. Wow. What a really, swell, scary, factory you have here under your giant mansion.
Sponsoring our team, supporting the Avatar. It was all just a big cover.
Yes. And the most difficult part was watching my daughter...  traipse around with a Firebending streetrat like you!
Dad, stop!  Why?
Sweetie, I wanted to keep you out of this for as long as I could,  but now that you know the truth, please, forgive me. These people, these benders... They took away your mother, the love of my life. They've ruined the world! But with Amon we can fix it, and build a perfect world together.  We can help people like us everywhere.  Join me, Asami.
No.
I love you, Dad.
Let's get out of here!
My metalbenders are on their way to Amon, and it's all my fault. Tarrlok's right, I failed as Chief. First thing in the morning, I'm handing in my resignation.
No! You can't give up like this.
I'm not giving up.  I'm going to find my officers and take Amon down. But I'm going to do it my way, outside the law.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you, but Asami's dad being an Equalist is not an easy thing to believe, even now.
I know. I'm sorry this whole thing happened.
So, does your offer to live at the Air Temple still stand?
Of course it does. And Asami's welcome too.
Thank you so much.
After everything she's been through, she's going to need you, Mako.
Yes! Whoo-hoo!
Man, I got a good feeling about tonight. I don't care if we are the underdogs, we can take those pompous Wolfbats. 
It's gonna be our toughest match ever, but I think you're right.
Introducing your new champs, the fantastic Fireee Ferrets!
Good morning, citizens of Republic City. This is Amon. I hope you all enjoyed last night's probending match, because it will be the last. It's time for this city to stop worshipping bending athletes as if they were heroes. I am calling on the council to shut down the bending arena and cancel the finals.  Or else, there will be severe consequences.
That guy's got some nerve.
You think the council will give in?
I'm not waiting to find out. We need to get to City Hall. 
Korra, you shouldn't be here. This is a closed meeting.
As the Avatar and a probending player, I have a right to be heard. You can't cancel the finals. 
I know winning the championship means a lot to you but as far as I'm concerned, we need to shut the arena down. 
What about the rest of you? Tarrlok, there's no way you're backing down from Amon, right? 
Actually, Tenzin and I agree for once. 
The council is unanimous. We're closing the arena.
No!
You can't!
I... I don't understand. I thought you of all people, would take a stand against Amon. 
While I am still committed to bringing that lunatic to justice, I will not put innocent lives at stake just so you and your friends can play. A game. 
Probending might only be a game to you, but think of what it means to the city. Right now the arena is the one place where benders and non-benders gather together in... in peace. To watch benders-
Beat each other up! In peace! It's an inspiration to everyone! 
I appreciate your naÔve idealism, but you're ignoring the reality of the situation.
The reality is, if you close the arena, you let Amon win. 
Yes! Exactly what she said. Yes.
I'm sorry but our decision has been made. This meeting is adjourned. 
I can't believe I'm saying this but I agree with the Avatar.
You do?
Yeah... you do?
I expected this kind of cut and run response from Tenzin,  but the rest of you? Come on, show a little more backbone. It's time that the benders of this city displayed some strength and unity against these Equalists.
We must prevent the conflict between benders and non-benders from escalating into all out war!  The council is not changing its position. 
Now, just a moment, Tenzin. Let us hear what our esteemed Chief of Police has in mind.
If you keep the arena open, my metalbenders and I will provide extra security during the championship match. There's no matter force to deal with the chi blockers. Our armor is impervious to their attacks. 
Are you saying that you will personally take responsibility for the safety of the spectators in the arena?
I guarantee it.
It is hard to argue with Chief Beifong's track record. If she is confident, her elite officers can protect the arena, then she has my support. I am changing my vote.  Who else is with me?  The arena stays open. Good luck in the finals!
Alright!
Yeah!
Thank you!
And... good luck to you, Chief Beifong.
A word please, Lin.  Tarrlok's playing you and I don't want to see you get hurt. 
I know what I'm doing and the risks that come with it. 
In that case, I'm going to be by your side during the match.
You don't need to babysit me. 
It's for Korra. I want to make sure she's safe.
Do what you want. It's not like I've never been able to stop you before. 
E...excuse me Chief Beifong, I wanted to thank you for your help.  It... really... means a lot... Ugh! What is her deal? Even when she's on my side, she's against me. 
I have known Lin since we were children. She's always been... challenging. 
What did your father do to make her hate the Avatar so much?
My father and Lin got along famously. I'm afraid her issues are with me.
gasp Wait a second, it all makes sense now! You and Beifong, Beifong and you! You two were a couple!
What?! How...  Where did you get that idea?!
Hah!  Your wife! 
Criminy. I'll have to have a word with her.
So... Pema stole you from Beifong. I'm surprised our esteemed Chief of Police didn't throw her in jail.
Well, she tried. Anyway, Pema didn't steal me, Lin and I have been growing apart for some time. We both had different goals in life-  Why am I even telling you this?! It all happened a long time ago and we've moved past it.
Hmm... Apparently Beifong hasn't. 
What do you m- Of course she has! Anyway, this is none of your business! 
See you at home, Mr. Heartbreaker. 
We just got word. The council defied your threat. They're keeping the arena open. 
Perfect. Everything is going according to plan.
How is the security sweep going? 
Fine.
They've checked underneath the stands?
Yes.
And you have enough officers to cover all points of entry?
I have the skies, the bay and every nook and cranny of this place covered. Now leave me alone and let me do my job. 
Lin, with so much on the line, it would be nice if we could help each other out. At least for one night.
Like old times? 
Like old times.
Okay. I'll try to be less abrasive than usual.
I would appreciate that.
Now I know there's a big crowd but don't be nervous. You're gonna do great, I believe in you. 
You're on, Pabu. 
Yes! Nailed it!  He's so talented.
Pfft. They've got nothing on us, buddy.  Anybody can howl. Whoo. Hmph, whatever.
I'm gonna knock Tahno's stupid hair off his stupid head.
Nice shot!
What's the big idea, ref? That was a hosing foul!
Oh come on, refs! There was some funny business in that last play. 
Wouldn't have guessed that you knew the rules of probending. 
Ahem, I've been brushing up. That Wolfbat blatantly bent a disc outside of his zone. 
What's wrong with these refs?! 
They've been paid off. It's the only explanation. Someone wants us to lose.
If the Wolfbats are gonna fight dirty, then so should we. 
No, we can't! The refs have it out for us. If we're gonna win this thing, it has to be fair and square. 
Ugh, that's no fun but alright.
The Fire Ferrets win the coin toss! Which element do you choose?
I'm taking this one. Let's go! You and me pretty boy. 
Thought you'd never asked.
Come on little girl, give me your best shot.
Hmph. Chump. 
Nice one!
That's the stuff, you are my herooo! Whoah!
We might actually win this thing!
Let's send them to a watery grave!
I can't believe your sweet tempered father was reincarnated into that girl. She's tough as nails. 
Reminds me of someone else I knew at that age. You two might get along if you only gave her a chance.
Hmph.
Knockout!
Oh, come on! Those were illegal head shots! Open your eyes, ref!
I barely broke a sweat. Anybody else want to scrap with the champs? 
Look out!
What?!
What's going on here, ref?
I don't know!
Alright, you want a piece of the Wolfbats? Here it comes! 
Wait, please don't do this! I'll give you the championship pot, I... I'll give you everything just please don't take my bending!
I believe I have your attention, benders of Republic City. So once again, the Wolfbats are your probending champions. It seems fitting that you celebrate three bullies who cheated their way to victory.  Because every day you threaten and abuse your fellow non-bending citizens, just like the Wolfbats did to their opponents tonight.  Those men were supposedly the best in the bending world and yet it only took a few moments for me to cleanse them of their impurity. Let this be a warning to all of you benders out there, if any of you stand in my way, you will meet the same fate.  Now, to my followers, for years the Equalists have been forced to hide in the shadows but now, we have the numbers and the strength to create a new Republic City! I'm happy to tell you the time for change has finally come.
How are we gonna get out of here?
Very soon the current tyrannical bending regime...
Pabu! Listen up, buddy.
Stop fooling around!
I'm not, I'm trying to save us!
...will no longer need to walk afraid...
See? Pabu is not a one trick poodlepony.
...It's time to take back our city. For centuries, benders possessed an unnatural advantaged over ordinary people.  But thankfully, modern technology has provided us with a way to even out the playing field.  Now anyone can hold the power of a chi blocker in their hand. My followers and I will not rest until the entire city achieves equality. And once that goal is achieved, we will equalize the rest of the world. The revolution has begun!
Tenzin! 
It's okay Pabu, just a little explosion.  Keep chewing, you're almost through it.  Yes! Great job, buddy!
I'm going after Amon!
Be careful!
Ughhh!!!
Ahhh!!!
You alright? 
I'm fine, thanks to you.
Don't mention it, kid.  Looks like we lost this one.
I'm so glad you're okay! 
Me too!
I can't believe Amon did this. I played right into his hand. 
He played us all. Republic City is at war.
It's been great having you in so many back to back practices Korra.
Feels good to be back. Although Tarrlok isn't too happy about my leave of absence. 
Hey, you joined the fire ferrets before you joined his task force. 
Okay, come on, team huddle time.  Uhm, it's our first match of the tournament tonight. I know the three of us haven't been a team for very long, but even so, the fire ferrets have never been this good. Are we ready?
Not quite.  You'll need these. 
Hey Asami.
Good morning sweetie.
These new uniforms look great.
You look great champ.
Well teammates, I'll see you before the match tonight. Asami and I have a lunch date. 
Albright, okay, we'll chat with you guys later, you know, see you when we see you.  Sooo, Korra, there they go, here we are, all alone in the gym. Just you and me, two alone people. Together. Alone. 
Uh, I gotta head back to the air temple to train with Tenzin. See ya!
Work with me here Pabu! You wanna look spic and span in your new uniform, don't you?  So, what do you think of Korra in a girlfriend sort of way?
She's great, but I think it makes more sense for me to go for Asami. 
I was talking about a girlfriend for me. Leave some ladies for the rest of us. 
I know, that's what I thought you meant. 
Well?
I dunno Bo, it doesn't seem like a good idea for you to date Korra. 
You just said she was great two seconds ago. 
Yeah, Korra's a great athlete, an Avatar and stuff. But I dunno if she's really girlfriend material. She's more like a pal.
Bro, you're nuts. Korra and I are perfect for each other. She's strong, I'm strong. She's fun, I'm fun. She's beautiful, I'm gorgeous!  Okay, I don't care what you think, I'm gonna ask Korra out. 
Look, it just isn't smart to date a teammate, especially during the tournament. Keep your head out of the clouds and your priorities straight, okay?
Yeah, yeah I know. Guh. You know what I'm talking about Pabu. I'm talkin' about real love.
So, how's it going with the tall, dreamy firebender boy? You've been spending a lot of time together lately. 
Oooh, yeah! Tell us all about the magical romance. 
What? Listen to you two. I'm not interested in Mako or any romantic stuff. Besides, he's all into that prissy, beautiful elegant rich girl...But let's just pretend for a second that I am interested in him, what would I do?
Oooh! I just read a historical saga where the heroine fell in love with the enemy general son who's supposed to marry the princess. You should do what she did.
Tell me!
She rode a dragon into battle and burned down the entire country. Then she jumped into a volcano.  It was so romantic. 
Uhh...
No, no, no! The best way to win a boy's heart is to brew a love potion of rainbows and sunsets that makes true lovers sprout wings and fly to a magical castle in the sky where they get married and eat clouds with spoons and use stars as ice cubes in their moonlight punch,  forever and ever and ever!
The volcano is starting to make more sense to me now. 
Oh, hey Pema... Uh, how long where you standing there?
Long enough. But trust me, I know what you're going through. Years ago I was in the exact same situation with Tenzin. 
Daddy was in love with someone else before you?
That's right. 
So what did you do?
Well, for the longest time I did nothing. I was so shy and scared of rejection, but watching my soul mate spend his life with the wrong woman became too painful. So I hung my chin out there and I confessed my love to Tenzin. And the rest is history. 
Woohooo!
Yes!
That's what I'm talking about.  Thank you! Thank you!
Wow, we were really connecting out there in that ring. 
Yeah! You know, I feel like the two of us have been connecting really well out of the ring too. 
Uh, sure. 
So I was thinking we should spend some time together.
We've been spending lots of time together. 
I mean outside of the gym, and not while searching for kidnapped family members or fighting chi-blockers. 
I don't know. Asami and I are... 
Look, I really like you and I think we were meant for each other.
Korra, I'm really sorry but I just don't feel the same way about you. 
Forget I ever said anything.
Congratulations guys! You were so amazing out there.
So, Korra, I was thinkin'; you and me, we could go get some dinner together. Sort of a date situation. 
Oh, that's really sweet but I don't think so. I don't feel very date-worthy.
Are you kidding me? You're the smartest, funniest, toughest, buffest, talentedest, incrediblest girl in the world!
You really feel that way about me?
I felt that way since the moment I saw you! Trust me, I know we're going to have so much fun together.
You know what? I could use some fun. Okay, sure. 
Yes! Who's the luckiest guy in the world? Right here, Bolin!
So, how do ya like it?
Mmm. It's delicious! And totally authentic. Man, I didn't realize how much I missed Watertribe grub. 
That's great, 'cause this is my favorite joint. See? You love Watertribe food, I love Watertribe food. Just another reason we are so great together. 
They are good noodles.  Hey, who's that creepy guy over there that keeps glaring at us. 
That's Tahno and the Wolfbats. The reigning champs three years running. Don't make eye contact.  Uh-oh, here he comes. Now don't mess with this guy. He's a nasty dude.
Well, well, well, if it isn't the Fire Ferrets, probending's saddest excuse for a team. Tell me, how do a couple of armatures like you luck your way into the tournament? Especially you, Avatar.  You know, if you'd like to learn how a real pro bends, I could give you some private lessons. 
You want to go toe to toe with me, pretty boy?
Go for it. I'll give you the first shot.
Korra, don't. He's just trying to bait you. You hit him, we're out of the tournament. 
I've never seen someone harass Tahno like that. You are one of a kind Korra. 
What kind of game are you playing?
Uh, probending. We've got a quarter-final match. 
No, I mean with Bolin. You got him all in a tizzy and I know you're only using him to get back at me. 
I am not. We're just having fun together. What do you care anyway?
I'm looking out for my little brother. I don't want to see his heart get broken. 
Wait a second. You're not worried about him, you're jealous. You do have feelings for me. 
What? Jealous? Pfft, don't be ridiculous. 
Admit it, you like me. 
No, I'm with Asami. 
Yeah, but when you're with her you're thinking about me aren't you?
Get over yourself!
I'm just being honest. 
You're crazy!
You're a liar!
Hey Makoo-ooo, oh. 
You were supposed to defend while I attacked!
I had an opening so I took it!
What is up with you two? Alright, whatever, just pull it together guys.
The Fire Ferrets win the coin toss. Which element do you choose?
I got this. 
I know you usually handle these but frankly your head's not in the game. I'm gonna take this one.  We choose earth. 
We need to talk. Look, sometimes you can be so infuriating. 
Save your breath. You've already made it clear how you feel about me. 
No, I haven't. What I'm trying to say is, as much as you drive me crazy, I also think you're pretty amazing. 
So, you do like me?
Yes, but-  I like Asami too. I dunno, things are complicated. Been feeling really confused and I-
Bolin, this isn't what you think!  Great, look what you did!
You're blaming me?
You kissed me
You kissed me back!
Ugh!
Well played, Korra. 
'Morning Narook. My brother here?  Thanks.  Come on, wake up. Takin' you home bro. 
Don't call me that. You're not my brother. You're a brother betrayer. The only one I can trust anymore is Pabu. Pabu loves me. 
You're a mess and we've got the biggest match of our lives tonight. Let's go. 
No! I'm not going anywhere with you, you traitor. 
Guess we'll have to do this the hard way. 
Why?
I told you dating a teammate what a bad idea. 
You're a bad idea. Put me down! Put me down.
Hey! Watch it!
I'll unnecessary rough you up!
Well, I guess there's always next year. 
Come on, we still have a chance, even if it is a slim one. 
The way we're playing, we don't even deserve to be in the finals. 
Look, if we don't pull together and work as a team we'll never forgive ourselves. 
Lets just get this over with, the sooner the better. 
Ow!
Bolin!
Are you okay? How's your shoulder?
Aagh, it's messed up pretty bad. But I think I'll be alright. Bolin and Mako walk over to the lift and ride it up. There's a short moment of silence) Are we...gonna be alright?
Of course we are. We're brothers. We'll get through this mess. I'm sorry. 
Me too. Girls. 
Seriously. 
Shoulder, shoulder!
Sorry. 
That was pretty much the coolest thing I've ever seen. 
Thanks for not giving up on us. We never would've made it this far without you. I owe you, big time. 
You're welcome. So, I know things are confusing right now, but I hope we can still be friends. 
Definitely.
Oh. Ooh. You boys smell something in here?  Wait, I know what that is and that's the scent of losers. 
I hope we see you in the finals. Then we'll see who the losers really are. 
Yeah, I'm peein' my pants over here.
Grrrr
Great job! What a comeback Korra. I've never seen a hat trick like that. 
Thanks. But if it hadn't been for you and your father we wouldn't have had the chance to play. So thank you. 
Uh, if everyone's done with the thank you party, need some medical attention over here. 
Ooh, let me help. 
Ow! Gah, haven't you hurt me enough woman?
Relax! I'm a healer. I learned from Katara, the best there is. 
No no no no, oh. That's the stuff. 
Bolin, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. I didn't mean to let things get so out of hand. 
Aah, I'll be alright. We had fun together, didn't we?
I had a great time, honestly. You are one of a kind Bolin. 
Please, go on. I enjoy praise.
What? How is it over already?
Earth. Fire. Air. Water.  Only the Avatar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world. 
-and in the final round, the Buzzard Wasps won with a decisive knockout.  What do you say we go to the arena tonight, catch a few pro-bending matches?
That sport is a mockery of the noble tradition of bending.
Come on Tenzin. I've dreamed about seeing a pro-bending match since I was a kid, and now I'm just a ferry ride away from the arena. 
Korra, you're not here to watch that drivel, you're here to finish your Avatar training. So for the time being I want you to remain on the island.
Is that why you're keeping the White Lotus sentries around, to watch my every move?
Yes. In order to learn Airbending I believe you require a calm, quiet environment, free from any distractions.
Alright, you're the master.
So, my mother informed me that you've never been able to Airbend before.
Yeah, but I don't know why, the other elements came so easily to me. But every single time I've tried Airbending...  Nothing.
It's perfectly alright, we just need to be patient.  Often the element that's most difficult for the Avatar to master is the one most opposite to the Avatar's personality. For Aang it was Earthbending.
Yeah, well, I'm about as opposite an Airbender as you can get.
Let's begin your first lesson.
Korra's gonna Airbend, Korra's gonna Airbend!
What is that contraption?
A time honored tool that teaches the most fundamental aspect of Airbending. Jinora, would you like to explain this exercise? 
The goal is to weave your way through the gates and make it to the other side without touching them.
Seems easy enough.
Jinora forgot to say you have to make it through while the gates are spinning.
The key is to be like the leaf. Flow with the movement of the gates. Jinora will demonstrate.  Airbending is all about spiral movements. When you meet resistance, you must be able to switch direction at a momentís notice.
Let's do this.
Don't force your way through!
Dance, dance like the wind!
Be the leaf!
Airbend.  What is wrong with me? Airbend.  Ugh, maybe I'm just not cut out to be an Airbender, huh, Naga?
Korra, come down here, please.
You shut it off at the best part!
I thought I made myself clear, I don't want you listening to this distracting nonsense.
But it's their radio, and technically you said I couldn't watch a match, you didn't say anything about listening to one.
You...  You know what I meant. Anyway, shouldn't you... shouldn't you be in bed by now?
I think I'm doing it wrong.
There's nothing to do. Let your mind and your spirit be free, for air is the element of freedom.
Yeah, you're telling me to embrace freedom but you won't even let me listen to the radio. And forget about leaving this island.
Please, Korra. Look at Meelo, he is able to meditate peacefully.
Actually I think he's asleep.
What?  Well at least he has the relaxing part down.
Whatever. None of this Airbending stuff makes any sense to me.
I know you're frustrated but these teachings will sink in over time. Then one day they'll just click.
Yeah, it's not sinking in yet.  I'm gonna go get a glass of lychee juice.
Korra, the meditations not over yet.
Daddy, can I have some lychee justice too? 
No.
Ohhhhh.
Hey! What are you doing in my gym? 
Uh, I was just looking for a bathroom and I got lost.
Ah, the old ëI had to peeí excuse.  You know, I'm sick and tired of you kids sneaking in and not paying. I'm taking you in to security.
No, wait!
There you are! I've been looking everywhere for you. It's all right, Toza, she's with me.
Yeah, I'm with him.
So, you see, we're together.
Well, not ëtogetherí together. More like friends.
Right, friends. No, no, I didn't mean to imply-
Oh, you implied it.
Ah, I don't care what you are. I've got work to do. 
Right this way, miss.
And thank you sir.  Seriously, thanks.
What do you think? Best seats in the house, huh?
Whoa! Unbelievable! This place is even more amazing than I imagined.
Name's Bolin by the way.
Korra.
Psst, Bolin.
Yeah?
I told you.  You have to stop bringing in your crazy fangirls in here before the matches. Get her out of here.
Ah, come on Mako. All right, look, I kinda promised her she could stay. But man I've got a good feeling there's something special about her. I know it.
Mako? Wow, I heard you play on the radio. 
Come on, Bolin, we're up.
Or I could meet him later.
Yeah, sorry about that, my brother just gets real... focused before the match. Okay, I've gotta go. Wish me luck. Not that I'll need it.
Good luck. Knock em' out.
Come on Ferrets!
Come on Hasook, get you're act together.
Oh, no!
Ohhh!
Woohoo, yes! One more win and we're in the championship tournament.  So, what'd you think Korra?  Bolin's got some moves, huh?
What did I think?  What did I think?  That was amazing!
You did more harm than good out there. You almost cost us the match.
We won didn't we? 
Barely.
Get off my case, pal. 
Useless.
You guys were incredible out there. Especially you, Mr. Hat Trick. 
Oh, you're still here?
Oh, you're still a jerk?
Oooh, ha ha.
Anyway.  I've been immersed in Bending my entire life but I never learned how to move like that. It's like there's a whole new style here. Think you could show me a few tricks?
Absolutely.
Right now? Come on Bolin.
Just ignore him.  Yeah, I could show you the basics. I'm just not sure how my Earthbending would translate to your Waterbending. But we'll figure it out.
Won't be a problem.  I'm actually an Earthbender.
I'm sorry, no, no. I didn't mean to assume. Cause I, ya know, I was just figuring, with your Water Tribe getup... that you are... a water tribe... gal.
No, you're right I'm a Waterbender...  and a Firebender. 
Mmmhmm. I'm very confused right now. 
You're the Avatar,  and I'm an idiot.
Both are true.
No... way.  The Avatar!
Alright, let's see what you got.
That was great. Good power. But in a real match you'd be a sitting turtle duck.  Not so upright and flatfooted.  Stay light on your toes, right up until the moment when you need to dig in and strike. Then...  Pop, pop.
Okay. Let me try it again.
Wow, nice adjustment! You're a natural at this.
Not bad.
What's it take to impress this guy?
What? I said not bad.  You know what, it's getting late. I think I'm gonna turn in. You kids have fun.  Nice to meet you, "Avatar Korra."
Yeah, been a real pleasure.
See you upstairs bro.
Upstairs? You guys live here?
Yup. In the attic. It's nothing fancy, but we have some great views. So, back to bending, why don't you throw that combo one more time?
Patience, Korra.
That was a 2,000 year old historical treasure.  What... what is wrong with you?
There's nothing wrong with me. I've been practicing just like you taught me, but it isn't sinking in, okay? It hasn't clicked like you said it would. 
Korra, this isn't something you can force. If you would only listen to me.
I have been! But you know what I think? Maybe the problem isn't me. Maybe the reason I haven't learned Airbending yet is because you're a terrible teacher. 
Ughh.
Yeah, you're a terrible teacher daddy.  Wahh, ahh, ahhhh!
Okay, everyone here?  Wait, where's Korra?
Honestly Pema, I am  at my witsí end with that girl. IÖI don't know how to get through to her. 
Dear, the best thing you can do right now is to give Korra some space. 
You must promise me that your teenage years won't be like this. 
I will make no such promises.
I didn't miss your match, did I? You guys look like you lost already.
We might as well have.
Hasook's a no-good no-show!
Well, there goes our shot at the tournament... and the winnings.
Can't you ask one of those guys to fill in?
Nah, the rules say you can only compete on one team.
Well, then... how about me? I'm a top-notch Waterbender, if I do say so myself.  
But, you're the Avatar. Isn't that cheating?
It isn't cheating if I only do Waterbending. 
No way. I'd rather forfeit than look like a fool out there.
Wow, thanks for the vote of confidence.
We're in.
We are?
Yes!
Hey, I didn't agree to this.
You can thank me later.
This girl is crazy.
Don't do anything too fancy or aggressive. In fact, don't do anything. Just try not to get knocked off the ring.
You got it captain. 
Woo-hoo, man overboard! 
What? Why?
You're only allowed to knock players off the back of the ring, not over the sides!
Oh... whoops.
Argh. I'll show you over the line.
Pardon me everyone-
-have you seen Korra this evening? She's not in her room.
I'll get her myself!
Oh, hey Tenzin. I thought you didn't like coming to these matches, ha ha. 
Once again you have flagrantly disobeyed my orders. You were to stay on the island. Let's go. 
No, I'm kind of in the middle of something.
I have tried my very best to get through to you by being gentle and patient,  but clearly the only thing you respond to is force! So I am ordering you to come back to the temple, right now!
Why, so I can sit around and meditate at how bad I am at Airbending? You know, I'm beginning to think there is a reason I haven't been able to learn it. Because maybe I don't even need it!
What? That is a ludicrous suggestion! The Avatar needs to learn Airbending; it is not optional!
No, this  is what I need to learn: modern styles of fighting.
Being the Avatar isn't all about fighting, Korra. When will you learn that?
I have a match to go finish. 
How about that.
Woohoo! 
Korra, what can I say? You really came alive in that last round. The way you dodged their attacks, you are a natural. 
Thanks, but I can't take all the credit.  Someone else taught me those moves.
I think I owe you an apology too. I was trying to teach you about patience but I lost mine.
No hard feelings?
Of course not. By the way you were really good out there tonight.  You moved just like an Airbender. 
Wait,  you stayed and watched?
I did. Pro-bending turned out to be the perfect teaching tool for you.
I'll see you tomorrow for Airbending practice, bright and early.  And, by the way, I kind of permanently joined the Fire Ferrets and we're playing in the tournament in a couple of weeks.
Ugh.
After I take your bending away you will be nothing. 
It's alright, Naga. I just had a bad dream.
There is a madman running around our beloved city,  threatening to tear it apart. We need to create a task force whose sole mission is to find Amon and bring him to justice. 
Absolutely not. A move that aggressive would only further divide benders and non-benders. 
It would be my honor and privilege to accept such a duty.
This is just another one of your ploys to gain more power,  isn't it? 
All I'm trying to do is help. Think back, forty-two years ago Republic City was threatened by another dangerous man: Yakone. Your father wasn't afraid to deal with him head on. 
This is a completely different situation  and how dare you compare yourself to Avatar Aang!
Amon is not going to stop with the bending triads. Eventually he will come for all us benders, our friends, our families. Vote for this task force and I will stop Amon before it's too late. All in favor?
My fellow Equalists,  this is your leader, Amon.  As you have heard, the Republic council has voted to make me public enemy number one,  proving once again that the bending oppressors of this city will stop at nothing to quash our revolution.  But we can not be stopped. Our numbers grow stronger by the day.  You no longer have to live in fear. The time has come for benders to experience fear. 
Oh no! I'm so sorry! I didn't see you! 
How could you not see me? I mean I was ju-juss--  I was, I, I. Wow. I was, ahem. 
Are you okay? Did I hurt you? I am such an idiot. 
Don't worry, I'm fine. My brother hits me harder than that every day in practice. 
Wait, I recognize you. You're Mako, right? You play for the Fire Ferrets. 
Yeah, that's me. 
I am so embarrassed.  My name's Asami. Let me make this up to you somehow. Uh, how about I treat you to dinner? Tomorrow night, 8 o'clock, Kuang's Cuisine. 
Uh, Kuang's? I don't have any clothes nice enough for a place that classy. 
I'll take care of that. All you need to do is show up. So, it's a date? 
Uh, yeah. I guess so. I'll see you tomorrow night. 
We are grateful for this delicious food, for happiness, for compassion, and--
I'm not interrupting, am I?
This is my home, Tarrlok. We're about to eat dinner. 
Good because I am absolutely famished. Airbenders never turn away a hungry guest, am I right? 
I suppose.
Ahh, you must be the famous Avatar Korra. It is truly an honor. I am Councilman Tarrlok, representative from the Northern Water Tribe. 
Nice to meet you.
Why do you have three pony-tails?  And how come you smell like a lady? You're weird.
Well aren't you... precocious. So, I've been reading all about your adventures in the papers. Infiltrating Amon's rally, now that took some real initiative. 
Oh, thanks. I think you're the first authority figure in the city who's happy I'm here. 
Republic City is much better off now that you've arrived. 
Enough with the flattering, Tarrlok. What do you want from Korra? 
Patience, Tenzin. I'm getting to that. As you may have heard, I am assembling a task force that will strike at the heart of the revolution and I want you to join me. 
Really?
What?
I need someone who will help me attack Amon directly, someone who is fearless in the face of danger, and that someone is you. 
Join your task force? I can't.
I must admit, I'm rather surprised. I thought you'd jump at the chance to help me lead the charge against Amon. 
Me too.
I came to Republic City to finish my Avatar training with Tenzin. Right now I just need to focus on that. 
Which is why this opportunity is perfect. You would get on the job experience while performing your Avatar duty for the city. 
Korra gave you her answer. It's time for you to go. 
Very well. But, I'm not giving up on you just yet. You'll be hearing from me soon. It has been a pleasure, Avatar Korra.
Bye-bye, Pony-tail Man!
Hmph.
Ah, welcome to Kuang's Cuisine, Master Mako.
Uh, master?
The scarf stays. 
As you wish, sir. This way please.
I am such a big pro-bending fan. I caught all of your matches this season. 
All of them? Wow. Honestly, there were a few I wish you hadn't seen. 
Oh don't be ridiculous. You're amazing! I can't wait to see you play in the tournament. 
Yeah, well. Uhh. Maybe next year.
What do you mean? You made it in.
It just isn't in the cards for us right now. 
Tell me. What's the problem?
We don't have the cash to ani-up for the championship pot. So, it looks like we're out of the running. 
That's not fair. 
Pardon me, Miss Sato. Your main course.
Miss Sato? You wouldn't happen to be related to Hiroshi Sato, creator of the Satomobile?
Yeah, he's my dad.
Get outta town!
I'm serious! You want to meet him?
Meet the most successful captain of industry in all of Republic City? Yeah, I'll take you up on that. 
da, da da, cha, cha cha. Hello fellow teammate! 
Hey, Bolin. 
Missed you at practice this week. 
Yeah, sorry about that. 
Aww, that's alright. We're probably out of the tournament anyway unless some money miraculously drops out of the sky by tomorrow. Anyway, the reason I came by was to give you this. Ta-da!
Wow, thanks. What's this for?
Uhh, I can't remember now. Oh, yeah, now I remember! You saved me from Amon.
Oh, that? It was no big deal.
No big deal, are you serious? I was totally freaking out when he was coming at me with his creepy mask all,  "I will take away your bending forever!"  I mean that is scary stuff! I still can't sleep well. 
Mm-hmm.
Tell him I haven't changed my mind.
Who's this "Tarrlok" guy? Is he bothering you? Huh? 'Cause I can have a word with him.
Ha! No, it's not like that. He's just some old guy who works with Tenzin on the council. 
Oh! Good. Good, that sounds better. I like that better. 
It's very impressive, Mr. Sato. 
Please, call me Hiroshi. So, I understand you're dirt poor.
Uh... Well.
Young man, it is nothing to be ashamed of. I too came from humble beginnings. Why, when I was your age I was a mere shoe shiner and all I had to my name was an idea: the Satomobile.  Now I was fortunate enough to meet someone who believed in me and my work ethic. He gave me the money I needed to get my idea off the ground.  And I built the entire Future Industries Empire from that one, self-less loan. 
Dad, stop bragging! Just tell Mako the good news!
Heh heh heh heh heh.
What good news?
Well my daughter passionately told me all about your hard earned success in the Pro-Bending arena and about your team's current financial stumbling block. Now I hate to see you loose your chance at winning the championship just because you're short a few yuans. That's why I'm going to sponsor the Fire Ferrets in the tournament!
Are you serious!?
He's serious! My dad's going to cover your ani for the championship pot.
That, that is good news! 
There's just one catch. You all have to wear the Future Industries' logo on your uniforms.
I'll tattoo it on my chest if you want, Sir.  Thank you both so much. I promise the Fire Ferrets will make the most of this opportunity. 
Outta the way, Daddy! We're driving here! Beeeeeep! Beep beep beep!
Beep beep!
I see Tarrlok's gifts are getting more and more extravagant. 
Yeah. That guy doesn't know how to take "no" for an answer.
Korra, are you doing alright? 
Yeah, I'm fine. 
Why don't you take a break? I'm glad you turned down Tarrlok but I just wanted to make sure your decision was for the right reason. 
I'm just really focused on my airbending right now, is all. 
Right. That's what you said. You know, it's okay to be scared. The whole city is frightened by what's been going on. The important thing is to talk about our fears because if we don't, they can throw us out of balance.  I'm always here for you if you want to talk. 
It doesn't matter how many gifts Tarrlok sends, I'm not joining his task force! 
To what?
I can't believe this is all for me. 
I'm not sure what Tarrlok's plotting but keep your guard up. It's not like him just to throw a party for the fun of it. 
So glad you could make it, Avatar Korra. If you'll excuse us, the city awaits it's hero. 
Meelo, no! That is not a toilet! Oh, dear.
Korra, it is my pleasure to introduce Republic City's most famous industrialist, Hiroshi Sato.
Nice to meet you.
We're all expecting great things from you. 
Right. Greatness. 
Hey, Korra! 
This is my daughter, Asami.
It's lovely to meet you. Mako told me so much about you. 
Really, because he hasn't mentioned you at all. How did you two meet?
Asami crashed into him on her Moped. 
What? Are you okay? 
I'm fine. More than fine. Mr. Sato agreed to sponsor our team. We're back in the tournament. 
Isn't that great?!
Yeah, terrific. 
Chief Beifong! I believe you and Avatar Korra have already met. 
Hello! I've got this! One more question, Miss! I think if we could -- Hold up! Hold up!
If you'd be so kind, they just have a couple questions.
But--
Avatar Korra, you witnessed Amon take away people's bending firsthand. How serious a threat does he pose to the innocent citizens of Republic City?
Ahem. I think he presents a real problem. 
Than why have you refused to join Tarrlok's task force? As the Avatar, shouldn't you be going after Amon?
Well, I--
Why are you backing away from this fight?
What?! No, I've never backed away from anything in my life. 
You promised to serve this city. Are you going back on that promise now? Do you think Pro-Bending is more important than fighting the revolution? How do you think Avatar Aang would've handled this? Are you afraid of Amon?
I'm not afraid of anybody! If the city needs me, than, I'll join Tarrlok's task force and help fight Amon.
There's your headline, folks.
My fellow task force deputies. Tonight we will execute a raid on an underground chi-blocking training camp located in the Dragon Flats Burroughs. According to my sources there is a cellar under this bookstore where Equalists train chi-blocking in secret.
I'm going after those two!
Nice timing. Thanks, Tarrlok.
We make a good team, Avatar.
Yeah, we do. 
No Korra for practice again?
Doesn't look like it. 
Avatar Korra has bravely answered the call to action. With the two of us leading the charge, Republic City has nothing to fear from Amon and the Equalists.
Question for the Avatar! Amon remains at large. Why have you failed to locate him?
You wanna know why? Because Amon is hiding in the shadows like a coward.  Amon, I challenge you to a duel. No task force. No chi blockers. Just the two of us tonight at midnight on Avatar Aang Memorial Island. Let's cut to the chase and settle this thing. If you're man enough to face me. 
I know it sounds weird to say this but I'm really glad I hit you with my Moped. 
Uh, aw, me too. 
I forgot to ask. Why didn't you accept the new silk scarf I bought for you last week? You didn't like it?
No, it was really nice. But this scarf was my father's and it's all I have left of him. I just feel like, like it keeps me safe. 
I'm so sorry. I lost my mother when I was very young.  I feel so safe with you. 
Korra, this is madness!
Don't try to stop me and don't follow me. I have to face Amon alone. 
This is all your doing!
I tried to talk her out of it too but she's made up her mind.  We'll be watching the island closely. If anything goes wrong I have a fleet of police air ships ready to swoop down. 
Guess you're a no-show, Amon. Who's scared now? 
I received your invitation, young Avatar.  Our showdown, while inevitable, is premature. Although it would be the simplist thing for me to take away your bending right now, I won't. You'd only become a martyr. Benders of every nation would rally behind your untimely demise. But I assure you I have a plan and I'm saving you for last. Then you'll get your duel and I will destroy you. 
Aang?
Korra! Korra, are you alright? What happened? Was Amon here? 
Ye-yeah. He ambushed me. 
Did he, did he take your bending away?
No. I'm okay. 
Oh, thank goodness.
I was so terrified! I felt so helpless.
It's alright. The nightmare is over. 
You were right. I've been scared this whole time. I've never felt like this before and I don't know what to do. 
Admitting your fears is the first, and most difficult, step in overcoming them. 
Earth... Fire... Air... Water.
The White Lotus has honored my family by coming. Thank you.
Welcome.
Then you should be happy to know, your search has come to an end. 
Korra, please come in here.
I'm the Avatar, you gotta deal with it!
She's strong.
Woo hoo! Hey, why all the doom and gloom people? We should be celebrating! Three elements down, one to go. 
I haven't ignored it. It just doesn't come as easy to me. But that's why I should start training with Tenzin immediately. He's "Mister Spiritual."
Yes. If anyone can teach her what she needs to learn, its Tenzin.
Yes! Finally! I mean... Thank you all for believing in me. 
Naga, you should have seen it. I kicked some firebender butt, and I passed! Tenzin will be here in a few days.
Just taking Naga out for a stroll. Don't worry we're not going far.
Naga go. That a girl. Go! Go! Go!
Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet? It looks like we are there. I know this is very familiar. Are we here yet? Are we here yet? Oh, please say we are here!
Yes, Ikki. As I have been telling you for the last 15 minutes, we are finally here. 
Weee! Hehehe!
Hello, Mother. I can't tell you happy I am to see you. Please, help me.
Unhand me strange woman!
That's your grandmother, Meelo.
It's so good to see all of you.
Gran Gran, I have been reading all about your old adventures. I've been dying to ask you, what happened to Zuko's mom?
Well, Jinora, it's an incredible tale...
Gran Gran, you look old. How old are you? And why is it so cold in the South Pole? Can we make a campfire and all hudle around it and tell scary stories, and make snowmen? And then can you make the snowmen move with waterbending and chase us? Wouldn't that be fun? Huh, wouldn't it?
Pema let me help you. Careful now. Careful.
Stop doting on me. I'm not helpless, I'm just pregnant.
The baby's strong. I see another airbender in your future.
All I want is just one child like me. A nice non bender who doesn't blast wind in my face every 5 seconds.
Mommy look, I'm a snow bender!
Were Tenzin and his siblings this crazy when they were kids?
Kya and Bumi certainly were, but Tenzin has always been rather serious.
Mother, please. 
Korra? Look at you. So big and strong. You've grown into quite the young Avatar.
Master Tenzin, I'm so glad you're here. I can't wait to get started.
Yes, well... uh...
You're going to have to tell her sooner or later.
What? Tell me what?
You're not staying are you?
I'm afraid not. We're only visiting for the night, then I have to return to Republic City.
But, no... you're supposed to move here. You're supposed to teach me. 
I'm sorry Korra, your airbending training is going to have to wait.
So how long until you are ready to teach me airbending? A week? A month? 
It could be much longer
I don't understand. Why are you making me wait?
I have a responsibility to Republic City. I am one of it's leaders, and the situation there is very unstable right now.
But you also have a responsibility to teach me. Believe me I'd be happy to find another airbending master, but you're the only one. We're stuck with each other.
I wish there were another way.
Wait, there is! If you can't stay here, then i'll go back to Republic City with you. It's perfect!
I get that. But I don't think keeping me locked up in this compound like a prisoner is what he had in mind.
I know this is difficult to accept, but its not the right time for you to come to the city.
Whatever.
Goodbye, Gran Gran!
Oogi, yip yip!
Nice night for an escape, isn't it?
I have to leave. I have to find my own path as the Avatar.
I know you do. Aang's time has passed. My brother and many of my friends are gone. It's time for you and your generation to take on the responsibility of keeping peace and balance in the world. But I think you're going to be a great Avatar. 
Thank you.
Goodbye, Korra.
Mom, Dad. I'll miss you.
We love you so much.
Naga, we're here!
Thanks for the ride! 
Wow, look at this place, I've never seen so many satomobiles. Air Temple Island. That's where Tenzin lives. You ready for a little swim girl?
Ok! Ok! Food first, then air temple. Watch it Naga! Look out! Oops, sorry about that. Excuse us. Coming through. Heads up. Eh, sorry, we're new in town. Naga, wait. 
We'll take one of everything please.
I don't have any money. 
Don't worry girl, this city's huge. I bet we can find a place to rustle up something to eat.

Oh, uh, yeah sure. So, do you .. live in that bush?
So, there are a lot of you out here? I thought everyone in the city was "living it up."
Hey, you! Stop! You can't fish here!
What are you talking about? Bending is the coolest thing in the world!
Yeah, I am.
I'm seriously thinking about it.
I'm not oppressing anyone! You're... you're oppressing yourself.
Excuse me, I think I'm lost. How do I get to Air Temple Island from here?
Or else what hoodlum?
You're the only ones who are gonna need a hospital. And for your sake, I hope there's one nearby.
Why don't you come and find out.
Got an idea about who I am now, chups? 
You're not getting away!
Cool, metal benders. I caught the bad guys for you, officers.

What do you mean I am under arrest? Those are the bad guys over there, they were smashing up a shop!
From the looks of it, you smashed up a lot more than that.
Wait, you... you can't arrest me, let me explain!
You can explain yourself all you like down at headquarters.
Let's see, multiple counts of destruction of private and city property... not to mention evading arrest. You're in a whole mess of trouble young lady.
But there were some thugs threatening a helpless shop keeper and I had to...
Can it! You should have called the police and stayed out of the way.
But I couldn't just sit by and do nothing. It's my duty to help people. See, I'm the Avatar.
Oh I am well aware of who you are. And your Avatar title might impress some people, but not me.
Alright, fine. Then I want to talk to whoever's in charge.
You're talking to her. I'm Chief Beifong.
Wait, Beifong. Lin Beifong? You're Toph's daughter!
What of it?
Then why are you treating me like a criminal? Avatar Aang and your mother were friends, They saved the world together.
That's anciet history... and it's got diddle squat to do with the mess you're in right now. You can't just waltz in here and dole out vigilante justice like you own the place!
Chief, Councilman Tenzin is here.
Let him in.
Tenzin, sorry... I got a little side tracked on my way to see you.
[takes a deep breath] Lin, you are looking radiant as usual.
Cut the garbage, Tenzin. Why is the Avatar in Republic City? I thought you were supposed to be moving down to the South Pole to train her?
My relocation has been delayed. The Avatar, on the other hand, will be heading back to the South Pole immediately, where she will stay put.
But!
If you would be so kind as to drop the charges against korra, I will take full responsibility for today's regrettable events, and cover all the damages.
Fine. Get her out of my city.
Always a pleasure, Lin. Let's go Korra.
Tenzin, please, don't send me back home.
You blantanly disobeyed my wishes, and the orders of the White Lotus
Katara agreed with me that I should come. She said my destiny is in Republic City.
Don't bring my mother into this!
Look, I can't wait any longer to finish my training. Being couped up and hidden away from the world isn't helping me become a better Avatar. I saw a lot of the city today, and it's totally out of whack. I understand now why you need to stay. Republic City does need you, but it needs me too.
You... ugh...
Are you coming to live with us on the island?
No, I'm sorry Ikki. I have to go home now.
Oh...
Wait. I have done my best to guide Republic City towards the dream my father had for it, but you are right. It has fallen out of balance since he passed. I thought I should put off your training in order to uphold his legacy, but you are his legacy. You may stay and train airbending here with me. Republic City needs its Avatar once again.
Yes! Thank you! You're the best!
Hello, I'm Korra, your new Avatar. 
Uh, yes, I am definitely here to stay, but honestly, I don't exactly have a plan yet. See I'm still in training... but... look, all I know is Avatar Aang meant for this city to be the center of peace and balance in the world, and I believe we can make his dream a reality. I look forward to serving you! I am so happy to be here. Thank you Republic City!
Alright, that's all the questions the Av--
Amon, how do you want to handle this?
So, the Avatar has arrived early. It looks like we'll have to accelerate our plans.
I think we found our secret airfield. Bolin, once we get down there I need you to tear up those runways. We can't let those aircraft take off.
Aye aye, Captain. Ooh. General, general.  All right, you guys wait here until we get back. Okay?  Uh uh. Stay.
Why would there be fence posts, but no fence? 
Thank you all for joining me on this historic occasion. When I was a boy, a firebender struck down my entire family and left me scarred. That tragic event began my quest to equalize the world.
That's a lie. Amon.  Or should I call you Noatak? 
You want her taken out? 
No.  Everyone calm down. We have nothing to fear from the Avatar. Let's hear what she has to say.
Amon has been lying to you. The spirits didn't give him the power to take people's bending away; he uses bloodbending to do it. Amon is a waterbender! 
What is this nonsense?
You're desperate, Avatar. Making up stories about me is a pathetic last resort. 
Your family wasn't killed by a firebender. His father was Yakone, and his brother is Councilman Tarrlok.
An amusing tale, but I will show you the truth.  This is what a firebender did to me.
What?  I'm telling you he's a waterbender!  They don't believe me. It didn't work.
We said what we had to. Let's get out of here. 
I wouldn't leave yet, Avatar. You'll miss the main event. 
No. They got away. We saw them get away.
Asami. Asami, I know I have hurt you, and I am sorry. But I believe that one day you will come to your senses, and we can be a family again.
Are you insane? How can we be a family after everything you've done? Mom would hate you for what you've become.
How dare you?! I am avenging her death!
The airplanes are ready for takeoff, sir.
Good. Annihilate the fleet.  That's right, General. I intercepted your message to Commander Bumi. I know exactly where they're hiding.
How are we going to get out of here? 
I don't suppose you know how to metalbend?
That is a negative, sir. 
Naga! Over here!  Who needs a metalbender?  We got Naga yeah!
I'm going after those airplanes!
No, Naga! 
What do you know? Just like a Future Industries forklift.
Tonight I rid the world of airbending, forever.
Amon, let them go! 
You're welcome to come down here and try to stop me.
He's trying to bait you. 
I don't care! We have to save them.
The Avatar needs to be reminded of the power I possess. 
Where are Pema and the baby?
In prison.
Beifong?
I don't know.  
Follow me, kids.
Get them out of here. We'll create a diversion.
Let's go get your mother and the baby.
Prison break!
Let her go!  
No!
Korra! 
I told you I would destroy you.
Thanks for looking out for me, Aang.
Whoa! Thanks, Naga.
Asami!  What do you think you're doing? You are aiding the very people who took your mother away! 
You don't feel love for Mom anymore. You're too filled with hatred. 
You ungrateful, insolent child.
I now see there is no chance to save you! 
Mr. Sato, you are a horrible father! 
You really are a horrible father. 
Finally, you are powerless. 
Amon, everything the Avatar said is true, isn't it? I just saw you bloodbend her!  You traitor! I dedicated my life to you! 
You've served me well, Lieutenant. 
Mako, my bending.
Everything'll be all right! We just need to get out of here! 
I'm impressed. No one has ever gotten the better of me like that.  It is almost a shame to take the bending of someone so talented. Almost.
No!  
Impossible!
I-I can airbend? I can airbend!  No... you... don't!
Did you see what happened? Who was that?
Evil Avatar! 
He's waterbending?
Noatak.
It's over, brother. I'm sorry for what I had to do to you.
Our father set us on this path. Fate caused us to collide. I should have left with you when we were boys.
Leave with me now. We have a second chance. We can start over together. Please, you're all I have left in the world.
I can't believe Amon got you too.
Hey, at least you unlocked your airbending. 
Bro, not the time.
Right, right.  I'll just stand over here. Quietly. In silence.
You saved Republic City.
But Amon got away. 
Yay! Uncle Bumi's here!
Waaaaaaahoooooooooo! 
Great, now I have to entertain my brother.
The two of us, together again. There's nothing we can't do!
Yes, Noatak.
Noatak.  I'd almost forgotten the sound of my own name.
It will be just like the good old days. 
I've tried everything in my power, but I cannot restore Korra's bending.
But you're the best healer in the world! You have to keep trying.
I'm sorry there's nothing else I can do. Korra can still airbend, but her connection to the other element's has been severed. 
It's going to be all right, Korra.
No, it's not. 
Korra, wait!
Go away. 
I will, but I just want you to know I'm here for you. 
No, I mean go away. Back to Republic City. Get on with your life.
What are you talking about?
I'm not the Avatar anymore. You don't need to do me any favors.
I don't care if you're the Avatar or not. Listen. When Tarrlok took you I was losing my mind at the thought of never seeing you again. I realized...  I love you, Korra.
I can't. 
Korra!
We need to be patient with her. It will take time for her to accept what has happened.
Not now, Tenzin. I just want to be left alone. 
But you called me here.
Aang.
You have finally connected with your spiritual self.
How?
When we hit our lowest point, we are open to the greatest change.
I love you too. 
Thank you.
I am so proud of you, Avatar Korra.
Initiate lockdown. Find the Avatar and whoever else is with her.
We need to move fast. Su, Lin, climb up to the arm and try to disable that weapon. Mako, Bolin, get to the engine and see if you can power this thing down. I'm going after Kuvira.
Are you sure? When you fought Kuvira before...
I know. She almost destroyed me. Not this time.
I'm going for that lever. You get the other one.
Hey! 
Ooh!
I'll deal with this guy. Disable the weapon!
Nice work.
The outside may be platinum, but we can do a lot of damage in here.
The weapon's loading mechanism has malfunctioned. We're unable to fire.
It's no malfunction. I can feel someone metalbending inside the arm. 
I lost the connection. The weapon's useless now.
I'm ready!
Be with you in one second! Kind of busy!
Okay! Ready now!
One. Two. Three! 
Nothing's happening.
Kuvira must have done some override thing and taken control!
There's got to be some other way to shut down power from here.
Um... 
Come on. You spent all that time working with Varrick and Baatar Jr. Didn't any of their genius rub off on you?
Look, the only thing I know about these vines is that if you mess around with them too much, they explode.
Get those engineers out of here. I have an idea. 
Want to fill me in?
I'm gonna zap these vines with some electricity.
Let's back it up, okay? I said that will make the vines explode.
Exactly. This is our only way of shutting this thing down. I can handle it.
No, you can't. This isn't the time to prove how awesome you are. I already know how awesome you are. You're awesome.
I don't have time to argue! I'm doing this, so get out of here.
Okay. But for the record, I do not approve. Just get out as soon as you can.  Promise?
Promise. 
I love you.
I love you, too. Now go!
It's over. You're gonna call off your army and surrender to President Raiko.  Then you and- uh!
Stop!
Kuvira! Give up!
Never.
Please, stop this madness! It has to end now!
If you really want to end it, then come and get me!
Now it's over.
Don't!
Shut it down!
I can't!  Ah!
Look!
A new spirit portal.
Korra!
Tenzin, there's no sign of her. 
Keep looking.  Korra?  Korra!
What happened? Are we... dead?
No. We're okay,  but we're in the Spirit World.  All the energy from your weapon tore open a new portal  and blasted us in here.
Why would you save my life?  After everything I did to you.
I guess...  I see a lot of myself in you.
We are nothing alike.
Yes, we are. We're both fierce and determined to succeed, sometimes without thinking things through.
This wasn't how  I wanted things to end. If you had all just surrendered, none of this would've happened.
You brought this on yourself.  Messing with the spirit vines, acting like a dictator over your people- you had to know what you were doing wasn't right.
I was trying to help my people. Su turned her back on the Earth Kingdom, you were gone. I had to do something.
I think I get it now.
You don't understand anything about me.
I do.  Su told me how she took you in when you were younger.  It must have been so hard being an orphan.
Don't pretend you know what it felt like. The Avatar is adored by millions!  I was cast aside by my own parents, like I meant nothing to them!  How could I just stand by and watch the same thing  happen to my nation when  it needed someone to guide it?
You wanted to create  a place where you and your people would never be vulnerable  again.  I may not have been an orphan, but believe me, I understand what it feels like to be afraid.  After I was poisoned, I would've done anything to feel in control.
The spirits  have returned.
And so has Korra!
Ha-ha!  You're okay! 
Stand down. This battle is over.  I owe the Avatar my life. Her power is beyond anything I could ever hope to achieve.  I'll accept whatever punishment  the World sees fit. 
And Su,  I'm sorry for all the anguish I've caused you and your family. 
You're going to answer for everything you've done.
Ha-ha!
And though the battle took a severe toll on our beloved city, out of the destruction, love did bloom.  So that is why, dearest friends and family,  we gather today to celebrate the wondrous  and at times inexplicable bond  between Sir Varrick  and the Lady Zhu Li!
Hey, pal.  Camera on me. This is my big day!
True love  is a fickle creature, difficult to find, nearly impossible to tame, but  Varrick and Zhu Li have proven that even the longest of long shots  can have a chance at happiness  together.  Now for the vows! 
Thank you, Master Pabu.   Do you, Sir Iknik  Blackstone Varrick of the Southern Water Tribe, glances down at the vows) Will you promise to treat her not as your assistant but as your honored  and cherished partner?
You're darn tootin' I do!
And do you, Zhu Li, take Varrick to be your lawfully wedded husband? Do you promise to care for him in sickness and in health,  and-  and also scrub his calluses on a bi-weekly basis,  which isn't really that much to ask-  Okay, I'm not reading all this.
You may now  do the thing.
Oh!
You just make me  so dang happy. 
My cousin told me how level-headed you were during the whole evacuation.  I got to admit, I'm impressed. I think you're gonna make a great leader,  but that doesn't mean I'm gonna set you up with Korra,  so don't ask.
That's okay, Mako. Sometimes, a good evacuation is its own reward.
Good to see you,  Prince Wu-  or should I say King Wu?  You ready to get back to Ba Sing Se and finally take the throne?
Yeah... about that.  I was actually thinking of stepping down as King  and getting rid of the monarchy altogether.
Are you joking?
For once, I'm not. Now, I know what you're gonna say:  I'm being lazy,  I'm afraid of responsibility, I'm putting my singing career before my people, but it's none of those things.  I really think the Earth Kingdom would be better off if the states were independent and had elected leaders like the United Republic.
That's actually pretty wise  and mature of you.
I think it's a great idea. The Earth Kingdom should evolve, and I'll do everything in my power to help you make that happen.
Looking forward to working  with you,  but for now, the dance floor calls! 
How's the arm?
Much better.
The words "thank you" don't feel big enough for what you did,  but I honestly don't know what else to say.
You don't need to say anything.  I want you to know  I'll follow you into battle no matter how crazy things get.  I've got your back  and I always will. 
I spoke to President Raiko.  Tomorrow, he's announcing a plan to expand the city rather than rebuild downtown.
I bet Aang never could've imagined  there'd be a spirit portal right in the heart of Republic City.
Korra,  you've transformed the World more in a few years  than most Avatars did during their lifetimes.
But I feel like I've only  just begun.  There's so much more I want to learn and do.
You don't know how happy I am to hear you so full of hope again.
It's been a bit of a bumpy ride, huh?
I've come to realize  life is one big 'bumpy' ride.
I know I was in a pretty dark place after I was poisoned,  but I finally understand why I had to go through all that.  I needed to understand what true suffering was so I could become more compassionate to others,  even to people like Kuvira.
Excuse me, Tenzin.  Varrick is looking for you.  Something about wanting to borrow a glider suit to fly off the tower?
That doesn't seem  like a good idea! 
Want to sit with me for a minute? I'm not ready to get back to the party just yet. 
I don't think I ever really apologized.
For what?
For being gone all that time. For not coming back sooner.
You don't need to apologize for anything.  I'm just so happy you're here now.  I don't think I could have handled losing you  and my father in the same day. 
I am so sorry about what happened. 
Thank you.  I'm just glad I was able to forgive him.
So what now? Back to the dance floor?
I'm kind of all danced out.  Honestly, after everything that's happened the past few months, I could use a vacation. 
Let's do it.  Let's go on a vacation, just the two of us, anywhere you want.
Really?  Okay.  I've always wanted to see what the Spirit World's like.
Sounds perfect.
It is a glorious day, my Equalist brothers and sisters. Amon has torn down the tyrannical bending government.  He has declared bending illegal  and  he has the Avatar on the run.  Our great leader has a vision for the future,  one day soon bending will no longer exist and we will live in a world everyone is finally equal! The United Forces are on their way right now to try and stop that dream  but we will prevail! 
Relax,  General Iroh's coming with an entire fleet of battleships.  Then Amon  will be the one who's running.
I hate this being patient stuff. 
You two were gone a while. 
We were doing reconnaissance. 
Whatever. 
Welcome back!  Hope you worked up an appetite 'cos dinner is served. 
Thanks so much for letting us  hide out with you the past few days. 
Honoured to oblige.  My associates and I heartily oppose  Amon's so called "Equalist policies". We got benders and non-benders living together  down here, but do you see us fightin'? No siree.  We figured out how to harmoniously co-exist. 
You are a wise  and noble hobo.  Mmm... This is  the best tasting street gruel I've ever had!  Seriously. 
I culled it from the finest dumpers the city has to offer. 
Blergh. 
Can't sleep  either? 
No, I have this  awful pit in my stomach. 
Me too.
It's so crazy.  A few months ago I was in the South Pole practicing for my firebending test, and now I'm in the middle  of an all out war. 
I know. We didn't even know each other then. And now, I can't imagine  my life without you  in it.  You're the most loyal, brave and selfless person I've ever known.
I think you're pretty incredible too but  you already knew that.  I should probably try to get some sleep. 
Me too. Good night. 
Good night.
You will now be cleansed of your impurity.  Next.
Coast is clear. 
Once The United Forces arrive,  we need to be ready to help in any way we can. 
They're here. 
Whoops. 
Hmm... Amon had to know we were coming,  so why aren't we meeting any resistance? 
Wait a second. Where are the Equalist  airships? 
I don't see any mecha tanks either.
Something's not right. 
It's a trick! 
Water and earthbenders, detonate those mines.  What is that sound? 
What now?
Where does Hiroshi find the time to keep inventing new evil machines?
It's alright, I've got you.
Avatar Korra,  you saved my life. Thank you. 
I was prepared to deal with Sato's mecha tanks  but not these new high speed aircraft. 
I know. Every time we think we have an advantage, Amon outsmarts us.
No matter what our plan is, he always has a better one. 
I like this man's confidence!  So, how  are we not out of the fight? 
A second wave of reinforcements is on the way, but I need to warn them.  Do you still have a way to get a message out?
I know just the man for the job.
And who is the recipient of this top secret message? 
Commander Bumi, Second Division of The United Forces. 
Tenzin's brother?
Yes. Bit of a wild man,  but the bravest commander you'll ever meet. 
Ready, sir. 
Fleet ambushed and destroyed by Equalist aircraft. Retreat to Red Sand Island until my signal. Do not approach city until you receive the all clear. 
They flew in from this direction. The airfield must be somewhere over this mountain range. 
Everyone get ready. We leave at dawn. 
It's time to take down my father.
Wait.  I'm sorry but  I'm not going with you tomorrow. 
What? 
Why not?
I'm sick and tired of hiding from Amon.  It's time I face him.
That's not a good plan, we need to stick together.
I'm not waiting for him to hunt me down. My guts tell me it's time to end this, on my terms. 
Korra, this is not  a mission you should be handling alone.
She won't be, I'm going with you.
You don't have to do that. 
Yes, I do. 
Hmm... My grandfather would respect the Avatar's instinct.  So will I.
Love you, little bro. 
Love you back, big bro. Korra, Amon is a nasty dude.  Be careful. 
I will. Good luck.  If you're going into the mountains, you should bring Naga.  Take good care of Bolin for me. 
Asami.  I'm sorry  things got so messed up between us but whatever happens today, I want you to know how much I care about you.
I care about you too.
Good fortune  and success to you  valiant heroes. 
There's Amon. 
We need to get into the temple.  Then, when he returns -
We ambush him.
What are you two doing here? 
Uhh...  we were just transferred. 
Well, you're getting transferred again. Amon wants extra security at the arena today. 
The arena? For what?
We'll be there,  sir.  I know another way in. 
Let's hide in the attic.
Uhh... we're not alone up here. 
Tarrlok? 
I don't suppose you're here to rescue me. 
We had no idea you were here. Are there other prisoners on the island? 
No.  I'm the only one. 
And what makes you so special? 
I'm Amon's brother.
Amon is from the Northern Water Tribe.  He's a waterbender and a bloodbender,  just like I was.
What?! 
Did you know this all along? 
No.  Not until after he captured me. 
How did your brother end up becoming Amon? 
It all began with my father, Yakone.  With the help of his former gang,  he escaped prison and underwent surgery to change his appearance.  He assumed a new identity  and settled down in the Northern Water Tribe.  That's where he met my mother.  A warm, caring woman.  Before long, they started a family together.  Amon was the first born,  under the name Noatak.  I was born three years later. Noatak was a good natured kid, always looking out for me.  Those were the good years before my brother and I discovered we were waterbenders.  At first we were excited by our new abilities  but our training  brought out a different side of my father. 
Tarrlok! You better shape up  or you'll be out here in the cold all night until you get it right.
I'm trying but...
Try harder!  Your brother was never this sloppy. 
Dad, he'll get it.  He just needs time. 
Don't talk back to me son, ever!
Even back then, my brother wanted everyone to be treated fairly and equally. When I was seven,  my father took me and Noatak on a hunting trip. Far away from our home.  He told us his true identity was Yakone. Republic City's  most notorious crime boss, and that he was once a bloodbender of rare skill.  What's bloodbending?
The most powerful and feared form of bending in the world. It was declared illegal thanks to that coward, Katara. Our family has the strongest line of bloodbenders in history. You boys have this power inside of you  and I will teach you to master it. 
What happened to your bending, dad? 
The Avatar stole it from me.  That's why I brought you out here, to learn your destiny.  You two will become bloodbenders of the highest order! When the time is right, you will claim Republic City,  and you will destroy the Avatar. You must avenge me.  That is your purpose in life.
The good days were behind us.  Every full moon, our father took us on another supposed hunting trip where  he secretly trained us in bloodbending.  We kept the truth from our mother. 
Stop, you're hurting it!
Toughen up, Tarrlok. You'll need a thicker skin for this. 
Very good son, very good. 
A few years later,  my father taught us to bloodbender any time without the need of the full moon.  We practiced constantly and  I hated every minute of it. 
I had no stomach for manipulating helpless animals.  My brother however, seemed to revel in his newfound power.  He was a prodigy,  mastering my father's psychic bloodbending technique by the time he was fourteen. 
That's the way it's done.  That's what you need to strive for. 
Even though Noatak was my father's favorite,  it wasn't any easier for him.  He carried the burden of all Yakone's expectations and demands.  Something changed  in Noatak over the years.  The loving brother I once knew became cold and detached.  Our father pushed us to extremes and one day,  he made us bloodbend each other.
Noatak, go. 
Excellent.  Tarrlok,  your turn.
No,  I won't do it. 
Bloodbend your brother, Tarrlok! 
That felt awful, I don't want  to do that to anyone! I never want to bloodbend again. 
You're a disgrace, a weakling!  I'll teach you a lesson you insubodinate...
Stay away from him. 
How dare you bloodbend me! 
What are you going to do about it?   You're the weak one.  You always say bloodbending is the most powerful thing in the world but it isn't. The Avatar is. He took your bending away.  What could be more powerful than that?
I made you what you are. You're mine.
We're your sons, not your tools of revenge.  Let's go. We can run away from him. Forever.
Run away? But what about mum? We can't  just leave her. 
I was right about you. You are a weakling. 
Noatak!  Don't leave, please!  Noatak!  My father and I searched for days but  we never found a sign of Noatak.  We thought he perished in that storm.  My mother was never the same  after the loss of my brother.  My father stopped training me.  With Noatak gone,  his hopes for revenge with it and  he passed away  a few years later.
That's one of the saddest stories I've ever heard. 
Avatar Korra,  I am truly sorry for all that I did to you. I thought I was better than my father, but his ghost still shaped me. I became a soldier of revenge,  just like he wanted me to be. And so did my brother. The revolution may be built on a lie, but I think Amon truly believes  bending is the source of all evil in the world.
How did you figure out Amon is your brother? 
When he took my bending, the sensation was somehow familiar.  I later recognized it as my brother's bloodbending grip.
So, he somehow uses bloodbending  to take people's bending.
I don't know how he does it but then again, I've never encountered a bender as strong as Noatak.
How  in the world  do we beat him? 
We can't.   Any attack we throw at him, he'll re-direct with his mind. That's how he has been able to challenge any bender. 
So much for our ambush. If we stay here, we're toast.  But there's another way to beat him!
How? 
This whole time, Amon has been one step ahead of us but finally, we  have the advantage. We know the truth about him. If we expose him as a bender in front of all his supporters...
At the rally.
We could take away his true power! 
And undermine this whole revolution.  
Thank you,  for your help.  We can't  just leave him here.
Go.  Amon can't know  anyone spoke with me.  Defeat him.  Put an end to this sad story. 
What are you doing?  TARRLOK!  You can't keep me in here forever!
Who is this? It's six in the morning. This better be important.
Councilman Tenzin here.  What?
What happened?  What was Korra doing at City Hall?
As I told Chief Saikhan, Korra came to my office late last night. She was upset that I arrested her friends. She asked me to release them and...  that's when the Equalists attacked.  I tried to protect Korra.  We were outnumbered.  Then I was electrocuted.  When I came to, the police had arrived but Korra was gone. I'm so sorry.  Chief Saikhan, mobilize the entire police force. We have to find the Avatar.
Hope you got enough beauty rest.  Come on, I'm busting you out.
Thanks.  I owe you.
Are you done yet?
Cover your ears! I can't go with you listening.
Asami!
Aaaagh!  A little privacy please?
Are you all right?
I'm fine. It's so good to see you.
Hate to break up your lovers' reunion,  but Korra's in trouble. Amon captured her.
No. No, she can't be gone.
Come on. We have an Avatar to rescue.
Your fly was down. 
Thanks for catching that.
Somebody!  Help!  Please!  Please.
I urge you to meditate on these visions.   I believe Aang's spirit is trying to tell you something.
What are you doing here, Aang?  I told you I have this under control.
Under normal circumstances I wouldn't get involved, but if what those victims said is true we're not dealing with a normal criminal. 
Fine.  Follow me, Twinkletoes. 
Toph, I'm forty years old.  You think you could stop with the nicknames?
'fraid not.
It's over.  You're under arrest, Yakone. 
What is Republic City coming to?  Used to be a man could enjoy his lunch in peace.
What's the big idea?
We have dozens of witnesses, Yakone. We know what you are. 
Take him away.
I've beaten every trumped-up charge you yahoos have brought against me,  and I'll beat this one too.
Whoa.  I finally connected with you, Aang. But  what are you trying to tell me? A way out of this box would be nice.
I have to go.  Call me back the minute you hear anything.  Lin, what're you-- you--  you should be in the hospital.  And you three! You should be in prison.
I figured you could use our help finding Korra.
Do you have any leads?
I've been on the phone all morning  but nothing yet.
We need Naga. She can track Korra.
I'm afraid her polar bear-dog is missing as well.
Then where do we start?
My guess is that the Equalists are hiding underground,  in the maze of tunnels beneath the city.
Underground.  Just like my father's secret factory.  Figures.
Yeah, yeah.  That makes sense. When those chi-blockers had me in their truck, in sounded like we drove into a tunnel.
I know where to start looking. Come on. 
Wherever Amon is keeping Korra, I bet that's where my officers are too.
Let's bring them all home, Lin.
The truck with Bolin took off down this alley. 
Which way?
Hmm.  This way kinda smells familiar. 
There's a tunnel nearby.  
There!
Motorcycle tracks.
Korra has to be in there.  Somewhere.
Let's try this way.
And what if Korra's not down there?
Then we pick another tunnel until we find her.
Hey, is Mako all right? He seems really worried about Korra.
Yeah, we all are.
I know, but he's your brother.  Do you think he likes Korra as more than just a friend? 
What?  No! That's just gossip. Where did you hear that?  Crazy talk is coming out of your mouth right now. Heh.
What do you know, Bolin? Come on. Spill it. 
Nothing. I mean...  there was this one  during the tournament when Mako and Korra kissed, but-- 
They kissed? 
Believe me, I was upset over it too, but I'm  over it. I don't think it meant anything. 
I doubt that.
Hide. 
That's where they must be keeping Korra.
We need to get down that tunnel.
You two.  Keep an eye on them.
My officers are inside. 
What about Korra?
I don't see her yet. 
Avatar Korra, where are you keeping her?!
I'm too late. That monsters already took you bending, didn't he?  I'm so sorry.  Come on, let's get you out of here.
I'll ask you one more time.  Where is she? 
What? 
I scanned the entire prison. Korra's not here.
Why would Tarrlok make up a story about getting attacked?
Because he has Korra.  He fooled us all!
Let's go, people!
Try to chi-block that, fools!
We got more company.
Hang on!
Yakone has ruled Republic City's criminal empire for years,  yet he has always managed  to stay out of the law's reach. Until now.  You will hear testimony from dozens of his victims  and they will tell you Yakone has maintain his grip on the underworld  by using an ability  that has been illegal for decades.  Bloodbending.
Councilman Sokka will now deliver the verdict. 
In my years, I have encountered people born with rare and unique bending abilities.  I once bested a man with my trusty boomerang who was able to firebend with his mind. Why, even metalbending was considered impossible for all of history until  our esteemed Chief of Police,  Toph Bei Fong, single-handedly developed the skill.  The overwhelming amount of testimony and evidence  has convinced this council that Yakone is one of these unique benders,  and he exploited his ability to commit these heinous crimes.  We find Yakone guilty of all charges and sentence him to life in prison. 
Thank you all for meeting us on such short notice.
Chief.
Lin. 
Have you news  of Avatar Korra?
We do.  You kidnapped her, Tarrlok.
I am shocked  you would accuse me  of such an evil act. I already explained. Equalists attacked and took her.
But there were no chi-blockers here last night.  You planted the evidence, didn't you?
That is a ridiculous accusation. 
Say goodbye to Republic City, Avatar Korra. You'll never see it again.
That is nonsense!  Everyone knows you're nothing but a squeaky-voiced liar.
Why did you wait until now to fess up?

Don't make this worse for yourself.  Tell us where you have Korra.
Wake up. 
Uuugghhh, man. I had this awful dream that Korra was taken by this evil bloodbender. So weird.
Bolin, that  really happened.  He knocked us out.
Are you serious?! Where is he?  Is he here right now?
Tarrlok is long gone. I'll alert the whole force.
We've only been out for a little while. Maybe we can still pick up Tarrlok's trail.
It could lead us to Korra. Let's go.
Yakone, you won't get away with this. 
This time I'm going to put you  to sleep for good.
I'm taking away your bending for good.
It's over.
Aang, this whole time you were trying to warn me   about Tarrlok.
My life is a disaster now, thanks to you. 
So your little bloodbending secret's out?  And I know how you bloodbent me without a Full Moon.  You're Yakone's son. 
I was his son, but in order to win Republic City I had to become someone else.  My father failed because he tried to rule the city from its rotten underbelly.  My plan was perfect. I was to be the city's savior.  But you,  you ruined EVERYTHING. 
Tarrlok, the jig is up and you have nowhere to go.
Oh no.  No, I'll escape  and start a new life, and  you're coming as my hostage. 
You'll never get away with this.
Amon! 
It is time for you to be equalized. 
You fools.  You've never faced bending like mine.
Huh?
What?  What are you?
I am the solution.
I'll take care of him. You four retrieve the Avatar. Don't underestimate her.  Electrocute the box to knock her out before you open it.
My pleasure.
It's payback time.
Open the box.  Tie her up.
I thought I told you not to underestimate her.
Naga,  you came looking for me.  Good girl.
That sounds like Naga.  Down there.
Korra!  Oh, thank goodness.
Where's Tarrlok?  How did you get away? 
Give her some space.
I was so worried. Are you all right?
I'm fine. I'm glad you're here.
You're safe now.
Mm-hmm.               
Uh, sir?
Man overboard! Man overboard!
Now we all know that our last match was garbage. Terrible. Even Pabu could have done a better job.  But that's in the past, because when you back a Fire Ferret in the corner, well, mister, he comes out fighting!  So let's get out there and bend like there's no tomorrow. Are you with me?     
Where's Mako when I need him? 
Looks like you had some car trouble, good thing the police are here.
I think these planes are finally ready to ship.      
Don't worry, I'm going to the South Pole to meet with someone who can help us put Future Industries back on top.          
Woah! Ah!
The Avatar is the winner!
No fair, you can't go into the Avatar State to win.
You did what?  The Avatar State is not to be used as a booster rocket. You are toying with a dangerous power that you obviously do not appreciate.          
It's the "Avatar State" and I'm the Avatar. Who appreciates it more than me?       
Clearly, you need more training to grasp the depths of your spiritual connections. Not to mention that you're still a long way from mastering airbending.           
I have mastered airbending. 
See? Mastered.         
Looks pretty good to me.   
Is it too late for you to un-retire from the United Forces?     
The paperwork's gone through, little brother. From now on, it's 24/7 Bumi Time!
You've mastered Korra-style airbending. Now you need to master real airbending. Hopefully, our visit to all of the Air Temples will give you the inspiration you need to delve more deeply into your studies.          
Can we see where Grandpa Aang was born?  
How many lemurs can I have?           
I want to get tattoos, but instead of arrows, I want lightning bolts.     
You can't get lightning bolts, that doesn't make any sense.              
You don't make any sense!              
Fight, fight, fight!
No one's fighting! We're going to have a wonderful time.  Now that the President is in office and I'm not needed on the council, I can finally relax with my family and give Korra the attention she needs.    
Great. More attention.         
Relax? I'd pay money to see that. Maybe I'll tag along just to see "Vacation Tenzin." 
You're not invited.  
Before we go on your Dad's study trip, we're going to have some real fun in my hometown at the Glacier Spirits Festival. They've got rides, games, and all kinds of fried food on sticks.    
Yep, there's Vacation Tenzin. And you can't stop me from going to the festival, Mom already invited me.
So I walk up and say, "Looks like you had some car trouble, good thing the police are here."   
Did you write that beforehand? 
Yeah, I had a few others.  Let's see, uh... "Looks like you guys should put more 'try' in triad," Huh? Or, "when you get to jail, tell 'em Mako sent ya."     
Ooh, I like that one.     
Okay, I'll use that next time. Bei Fong says if I keep it up, I could make detective soon.              
Oh, that sounds so fun. All I do is train all day. It's like Tenzin's totally forgotten how I beat Amon.      
Tenzin's just trying to help you become the best Avatar you can be.           
Of course you'd take his side. 
I'm not taking his side. I'm just-
I'm gonna take a walk.
Why is it so much easier to bust triads than it is to get through one conversation with my girlfriend?
Oh, you've all gotten so big.         
We missed you, Aunt Kya.      
Oh, I missed you too.  Your father doesn't bring you to visit nearly enough. He's probably scared I'll beat him up like when we were kids. 
I'm not scared of you...  Any more. 
You remember Mako.  
Sir.  
I hope you're not getting my daughter into any more trouble up in the city.      
Uh, no. I, uh--no.              
Knock it off, Dad.
Wow, look at all these people that came out to greet us.     
Uh, no... they came to greet them.
The great chief of the Northern Water Tribe comes to grace us with his presence. Hooray.
Just relax, Tonraq. He'll be gone soon enough. 
Whoa, who are the lovely ladies?          
That's Eska and Desna, the chief's children. Desna is a guy.       
Oh, no, sure. I knew that. And which one is Desna?
Good to see you again, Avatar Korra.   
Good to see you too. 
Tonraq.   
Brother.
It's a shame the Southerners have abandoned all connections to the spirits, even during the most hallowed times.    
I've always loved the Glacier Spirits Festival. It's fun.               
This festival used to be a solemn time of fasting and meditation. Now it's just a chance to watch some rube try to stick an entire arctic hen in his mouth.   
Wha- what? It's so good.    
Traditions change. It's not the end of the world.    
Tell that to the sailors who are being attacked by angry spirits in Southern waters. Some traditions have purpose.          
Wait, spirits are attacking ships?  
I'm surprised the Avatar doesn't know about that. Apparently you haven't been given all the information you need. It would be my honor to instruct you in the spiritual ways of the Water Tribe.       
I wouldn't mind learning about fighting spirits. Airbending is getting pretty boring.     
Tenzin is Korra's instructor. He can give her all the training she needs.
So you've said.
I'm glad you came with me to this meeting. Varrick is one of the richest men in the world, and he controls the entire global shipping business. So you're my assistant. Just stand there and don't say anything.     
No problem, Pabu and I are natural assistants. Man, this is nice. I gotta get into this whole "business" thing.
Did you see that? Levitation! I was a foot off the ground. Is that incredible or what?
It looked like you were just sitting on a pillow.
Are you saying I wasn't levitating?      
Uh... no?             
Well, why didn't anyone tell me? Now I look like an idiot! Swami, you're fired!
Aah!
I like you kid, you're a real straight shooter, just like me. Ms. Sato? He's with you?    
Mmm-hmm. 
Brought your tiger-shark with you to do business, huh? Now that's moxie.  Get over here and pop a squat. Zhu Li, get some tea for my guests.
Thank you for meeting with me. As you know, Future Industries is looking for a partner to handle our shipping-
Sure. But first, you gotta check out my new venture: moving pictures. Zhu Li, do the thing. You're gonna love this.
Mind-blowing, right?      
Yeah. 
Now, forget that! That's the past! Shut it off, Zhu Li! Imagine watching this. Ginger, come over here and do your poses.
Spectacular! And we tell a story; there's romance, action, some funny animal stuff for the kids. You know, whatever. Thanks Ginger, go rest your gams.  How about that, tiger-shark? We're gonna do big business with these "movers," as I call 'em.
Okaaay... but I'm just concentrating on getting Future Industries back on track. If we could hammer out a dea-         
Stop. Look me in the eye. 
We got a deal! 
We'll hammer out the details at the royal feast tonight. Now, who wants a rocket-boat ride? 
Is that how business usually goes?    
You are a natural assistant.
This is a wonderful feast in your honor, Uncle.    
This is nothing. When this festival was founded, the tribal elders would commune with the spirits. People would watch the brilliant displays of light as spirits danced in the sky.
Wow. I've never seen that. 
And that is a shame, since the Avatar is the bridge between the material world and the spirits. That is why I want so badly to teach you, to help you fulfill your destiny.
I thought I had made it clear that Tenzin is teaching her.        
Every Avatar before you traveled the world to learn. It was Tenzin and your father who kept you secluded at the South Pole.          
I thought Aang ordered the White Lotus to keep me down here?      
We all did what we thought was best for you.  
Who I train with should be my decision, Dad, not yours or Tenzin's.
Looks like someone's trying to take your place as the Avatar's stick-in-the-mud mentor.    
Bumi, don't pick on Tenzin, you know he's always been sensitive.   
I'm not sensitive!
As your chief, it is my honor to speak at this festival, which was founded to bring our tribes together and restore the ancient balance between our world and that of the spirits. But I am saddened to see what it has become- A cheap carnival that celebrates greedy and trivial humans.
I fear the time is fast approaching when the North can no longer stand idly by while our Southern brothers slip into total spiritual decay. Angry spirits are already attacking ships in your waters. I only hope we are not too late to change course. 
Chief Unalaq, everybody. Always great to have him in town. Now let's have some fun with Wacky Wushu's dancin' otter-penguins.
Wish me luck.  I'm making my move. Whee!            
Good luck.
Those two have always creeped me out. They smell like a grandma's attic.
Hey, I'm Bolin, a friend of Korra's. You're Eska, right? Wow, I'm just... I'm loving these robes.
So... you are from the North, right? Cool. That's like, you know, that's like, my favorite direction.  
I think he is trying to establish some kind of bond with you based on your geographic point of origin.        
Perhaps it would be interesting to spend time with a person whose ways are so rough and uncultured. You amuse me. I will make you mine.      
You mean like a boyfriend or... like a slave?     
Yes.  Win me prizes.
Unalaq offered to train me. He says he can teach me about the spirits and my connection to them. 
Sounds good. What does Tenzin think?     
Tenzin thinks I'm his prisoner or one of his kids. I'll never finish training with him in charge.    
I mean, you heard what Unalaq said. The South is spiritually unbalanced and it's the Avatar's job to fix it but my Dad won't even let me think about Unalaq teaching me.  Well? 
Well, what?     
What do you think I should do?    
I guess you should do what you think is right. I support whatever decision you make.               
Oh... thanks. That's a big help.
I thought you wanted me to be supportive. Now you want me to tell you what I think? Make up your mind.          
Just forget it.
Ugh. Naga, what are you doing?  Naga, hush.  Quiet Naga, you'll wake everyone up.    
What's going on? 
What. Is. That?
Got it!
Don't got it!
Korra!
Spirit, why are you angry with us? What have we done to offend you? 
Go in peace.
Korra! 
Are you all right?
How were you able to control that spirit when no one else could?     
As your father could tell you, I have spent my life studying the spirits and learning their ways. All of this knowledge is lost in the South, but I could teach you everything I know.
Chief Unalaq, clearly you are very knowledgeable but Korra still has much to learn about airbending, and I hope that going to the Air Temples will help her connect with the past Avatars.
Ugh.
The Air Temples will teach her nothing. Only I can give her the training she needs to be a complete Avatar.      
I've told you that will not happen.  
Hey, I'm right here! Anyone want to ask me what I think?          
Korra please, listen.  
I'm tired of listening to you. Both of you. You keep me locked up, telling me you know what's best but both of you were powerless against the spirit attack.  I think it's time I had a new teacher.      
Now, Korra-
Unalaq has proven he's the only one who knows what I need to learn. I have to go with him.     
Please, I know you're angry, but we've come so far together.        
I'm sorry, Tenzin.  This is as far as we go.    
It has been a pleasure serving you,  Avatar Korra.
I think you forgot a couple of things.       
Mother, I think I need some time alone with my family right now. 
This is your family, Tenzin. When you get to be my age, you'll be thankful for the time you had with your siblings. Besides, I think it's important that you all visit your father's home together.  
Come on, it'll be fun.    
I'm dying to see that laid-back "Vacation Tenzin" I've heard so much about.       
All right, hop on.  I love you, Mom. We'll see you soon.   
Oh!
Do you think I did the right thing?   
I don't know. I'm sorry, but I'm not very good at this Avatar counseling thing. But I know your heart is in the right place, you'll just have to trust it.       
I know this was a hard decision Korra, but it was the right one. Now it is time to put it behind you and begin your new training. I have great plans for you.  
Daddy, you're home. We waited up for you. Is Korra okay?
Yes, she's fine, sweetie. 
I was scared. I thought she wasn't coming back.
I'm sorry you were scared, but everything is going to be fine now. I promise.
The food tastes amazing, Pema. I'm finally starting to feel like myself again.
We're so thankful that you're home safe.
Let me help.
Korra, I realize that you've been through a lot, but I need to know everything that happened.
Well, first off, Tarrlok isn't who he says he is. He's Yakone's son.
It all makes sense now. That's how Tarrlok was able to bloodbend us without a Full Moon.
But how did you escape? And where's Tarrlok?
Amon captured him... and took his bending.
What?
Yeah. He showed up outta nowhere. He almost got me, too.
This is very disturbing news. Amon is becoming emboldened. Taking out a councilman, almost capturing the Avatar. I fear Amon is entering his endgame.
Pema, are you all right?
The baby is... just kicking really hard is all. I'm fine.
Should I get Tenzin?
No reason to worry him. It's nothing. 
Can I get some hot water? Korra needs more tea.
You're a firebender. Boil it yourself.
I'm gonna step out in case you two wanna talk.
Is there something we need to talk about?
I've noticed how you treat Korra, how you acted when she was missing. You have feelings for her, don't you?
What? No! She was taken by a crazy bloodbender. How did you expect me to act?
I like Korra, but you've been keeping the truth from me this whole time.
The truth? About what?
You're really going to make me say it.
Yes! Because I don't know what you're talking about.
The kiss, Mako. I know.
I -- well, I -- mph.  Bolin told you, didn't he?
Don't blame your brother for what you did. Do you have feelings for Korra or not?
Look, things are crazy right now. Can we deal with our relationship problems later? 
Well, there might not be any relationship to worry about later. 
Asami! 
Lin, I, uh, need to ask you a favor. It would mean the world to me, but I know it could be, uh, a potentially awkward situation. Furthermore, I--
Spit it out already.
Will you stay here and watch over Pema and the children while I meet with the Council? With everything that's happened lately I want to be sure my family is in safe hands.
Of course I'll help, old friend.
I didn't realize you two were out here.
Pema! Yes, yes, Lin has agreed to help out around here and keep an eye on things while I'm away.
Thank you. I could use the extra pair of hands.  Would you mind giving him a bath? He's filthy.
This is not what I signed on for!
Thank you, Lin! Oogi, yip yip. 
I gotta poo. Really bad.
The other council members. Are they all right?
This can't be happening.
All right, kids. Time to go inside!
We heard explosions. What's going on?
Republic City is under attack.
I've dreamed of this day for so long.
Yes. The time has come for the Equalists to claim Republic City as their own.
Where did you say you parked the car?
It's right around here somewhere. There it is!
Wow. Nice parking job. 
Hey, you guys got arrested and left me alone with the car. I made it very clear that I don't know how to drive. 
All things considered, you did a great job. But how are we going to pay for all these parking tickets? 
Relax. The city's under attack. The police have more important things to worry about. 
This'll come in handy.
Why don't you sit in back... with Korra.
I think I will. 
Everything all right?
Yeah. Everything's terrific.
CAR! Oh, we're good.
Send a river rescue unit.
What?
Chief Saikhan.
Tenzin! Am I glad to see you. I was afraid you'd been captured too. 
I'm the only council member left. What's the status?
Amon has launched simultaneous attacks across the boroughs. The police are trying to regain control but we're spread too thin. 
I need to send a wire.
The General of the United Forces.
Catch! 
Saikhan, the vents!  We need to evacuate immediately. Everyone, stay close to me.
Not these mecha tanks again!
Saikhan, no.
Jump!
Thank you.
Tenzin has escaped once again. I can't stand to see Asami fighting alongside those benders.
We will capture them before long. And you will have your daughter back.
Are you all right?
I'm fine. Thank you, kids. Another moment later and I would have been on my way to Amon.
Uhhh, guys? Look.
Oh no.
Everyone, hide inside and remain calm.  Pull it together, Pema. Didn't I just say remain calm?
Mommy? What's wrong?
The baby's coming!
Oh no!
Not now, baby!
The children, where are they?
Stay away from my Dad's ex-girlfriend. 
Jinora, you shouldn't be out here!
Get off our island! 
Girls, you need to go back inside this instant!
Taste my fury! 
Meelo, be careful!
Never mind.
Take these Equalists and lock them in the temple's basement.  Nice work, kids.
Dad!
Oh thank goodness you're all right.
We caught the bad guys.
You let them fight? Do you realize what could have happened?
I would have been toast if not for your kids. You should be proud. You taught them well.  Go on, be with your wife.
Pema!
Tenzin.
I'm here, Pema.
Our new son.
A brother? Well it's about time.
Welcome! I'm Ikki and this is Jinora and Meelo. We have a super-great family and we're so happy that you're a part of it.
What're you going to name him? Can I pick?
We already chose a name. 
Rohan.
I'm so sorry to interrupt but more airships are coming.
Everything's not going to be fine, is it, Daddy?
What do you want to do, Tenzin?
I need to protect my family and get them as far away from this conflict as possible. If Amon got his hands on my children... I hate to even think of it.
If you're leaving, then I'm going with you.
But--
No arguments. You and your family are the last airbenders. There's no way in the world I'm letting Amon take your bending away.
Thank you, Lin. Korra, I want you to leave this island and hide for the time being.
I'm not giving up.
I'm not asking you to. I sent word to the United Forces. They will be here soon. And once my family is safe, I will return. With the reinforcements, we can turn the tide in this war.
What you're saying is... we need to be patient. 
You're learning well.
Stay safe, Korra.
You too.
Tenzin, if we're leaving, we better do it now.
Oogi, yip yip.
Everyone, climb on!  Let's go girl. 
Moustache guy!
Nice one, Naga.
They're gaining on us!
Faster, Oogi!
Whatever happens to me, don't turn back.
Lin, what are you doing?!
That lady is my hero.
Yes, she is.
Korra, we should get moving.
Tell me where the Avatar is and I'll let you keep your bending.
I won't tell you anything, you monster.
Very well.
Go ahead. Take your time. Just bending a giant wall. Man, we got a lot of people here. Is that everybody?
Kuvira's heading our way with a platoon of mecha-suits.
What should we do? 
This is my hometown, and I hate to say it, but there's no use risking all our lives to fight that giant thing. Let her take the city for now. We'll think of some way to come back and beat her.
What about all the people who haven't been evacuated yet? If Kuvira finds out Wu is with them, she might fire that spirit cannon at him and take them all out.
I couldn't stop Kuvira from taking Zaofu. I'm not letting her conquer Republic City. The World isn't safe as long as she has that weapon.
I agree.  We take down that giant today.
Lin!
Glad to see you all made it out. You had me worried.
Well, you benders are gonna have to fight her alone. She just blew up our factory with all our hummingbird suits.
Not all of them. There are the prototypes back at my office. If we can get those ready to fly, we'll at least be able to offer a little air support.
Su, you take Baatar Jr. and the rest of the wounded back to Asami's office. Get those suits working as soon as you can. The rest of us will just have to face Kuvira on our own.
Everyone, please settle down. The trains should be returning to pick us up soon.
Tell that mecha-jerk to settle down. She's the one blowing up the whole city!
I hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but I just heard on the radio that Kuvira's army has destroyed the train tracks. We're not getting out of the city by rail.
Everyone, I was just up on the observation deck and saw a bunch of mecha-suit soldiers heading this way!
Oh, great! The giant one wasn't enough? It's over! We're all gonna get blown to bits!
Listen, everyone. I can get us out of here if you just sit tight. Can you step off the bench, please? It's a little crowded up here.
Sure. I'm only the conductor. No one needs me on the bench.
Just stay calm. I'll be right back. Come on!
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going?
I'm going to get some help. You think you can handle this unruly mob for a little while?
I raised Meelo. I can handle anything.
A paint store? That's it!
What are you doing, Meelo?
I just got an idea how to beat the giant! Now everyone, grab some paint and find me some balloons!
Airbenders approaching.
I see them.
Bombs away!
Clear the glass.
Now!
The joints are platinum, too! We can't metalbend any of it!
You're about to get the World's largest hot-foot, metal lady!
Hit it now!
Ugh!
Ugh, ahh!
Uh! Ah! Oof!
Opal!
Everyone, retreat. Take the wounded back to Asami's office.
I'll meet you there. I'm going to see if I can find help.
All right. let's fire it up again.
I can't stabilize it! I thought you fixed the hydraulics!
I did! Twist harder!
Ah-ah-oh!
I hope you have something in here that can take out a platoon of mecha-suits. Kuvira's troops are headed this way!
I know how to take down some mecha-suits, and it just might take down that giant, too! Asami, disconnect anything electrical in here until we get back. Zhu Li, let's go.
Just rest, son. I'm here.
I don't know, sweetie. She's a complicated person.
Yeah, they might take some time to come around,  but we'll work through it- as a family.
I know I can stop the mecha-suits with an electromagnetic pulse, so it stands to reason that I can stop a giant mecha-suit with a giant electromagnetic pulse.  Zhu Li, I've been thinking.
Yes, but lately, I've been thinking about you. I know we might not make it out of this mess, and I feel like there are some things I should tell you.
I remember when I was a boy, I had an ostrich-horse. Named her Mrs. Beaks.  I grew up on a farm. Did I ever tell you that, Zhu Li? This was before the circus people took me away. Anyway, I loved old Mrs. Beaks, but I took her for granted.
Yes! Dead in their tracks!  Oh, rats. She's still coming. Zhu Li, do the thing!
What was that?
An electromagnetic pulse. It shut down the mecha-suits, but our power source is fine.
Locate the source of the pulse. That must be where Varrick is. Third and Fourth mech platoons, move in and continue the sweep. Capture anyone left in this city.
Varrick, how come your electro-thingy shut down the small mecha-suits but not the big one?
It's not.
Dad?
I got him out of jail to help. I figured we need all the geniuses we can get our hands on right now. If the prison's still standing after all this is over, we can throw him back in.
I know what you all must think of me, but I love Republic City, and I would do anything to save her.
You think you know how to defeat this thing?
You must act like an infection: break the skin and attack the vital organs. Disconnect the heart and the brain and this beast cannot live.
But how are we supposed to get inside?
Future Industries has plasma says for cutting platinum. If we had one on the mecha-suit...
But the saws are way too big. We'd never get the suits off the ground.
I think I can add an electrical element to the welding torch on your suit and convert it into a plasma saw. Then we'll just have to land on the giant and cut open a hole big enough for someone to get in.
Like a metal mosquito.
You know what happens to mosquitoes that land on me? I squash 'em!
We'll have to attack in a swarm to try to keep you guys safe in the hummingbird suits. It looks like they're our only hope.
Oh, first he ate the fruit, then he ate the leaves, hungry little lemur ate up all my trees. Okay. Great job, everybody. Who's got another song for us?
We can't just sit around here singing old airbender songs until we're all captured or worse.
Should we play the button game? Who has a button?
Where did these badgermoles come from?
The zoo! Mako always hated my singing, but they love it!
Well,  what are we supposed to do with badgermoles?!
They're the best earthbenders around! We can use them to tunnel out of the city without Kuvira's troops spotting us!
Are you sure this is the best plan?  Let's follow the moles!
Badgermoles, digging holes, under Republic City. Got to run away from Kuvira today, although I do still think she's pretty.
Mech platoons, report.
I think we found the source of the electromagnetic pulse: Future Industries Tower.
That's the place.
Kuvira is headed our way.
How long will it take to get the plasma saws ready?
Just a few more minutes.
Get out there as soon as you can.
Thanks. We may not be able to beat that thing, but we can slow it down. Let's go!
Jinora!
Whoa!  Ooh!
Rah!
Oh, Yin. You're the sweetest evacuee I've ever known and I just want to thank you for being so kind when I was living in your home.
You don't need these people. They're just innocent civilians caught in the crossfire, but I'm Prince Wu, rightful leader of the Earth Kingdom. Take me to Kuvira. I've got business with her.
No! Don't do it, Wu!
I have to. But before I go, I'd like to sing you a song.  If you don't respect the broach, you don't respect me. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You're no better than a roach but I'm royalty.  I got my badgermoles with me!
You don't know  what you're talking about. 
Oh, badgermoles I love ya, I love ya. I want to, I want to pet your snouts.  Ha-ha!
If we stop that mecha-giant, it will all be because of you.
You're the one who designed these incredible suits.  It's great to be working together again.
I love you, Dad.
I love you, too.
Zhu Li?
I have something I need to attach before we take off.
I need to attach this ring to your finger.  Zhu Li Moon, will you do the thing for the rest of our lives?
Yes! 
Now, let's go attach these barely-functional rust buckets to a giant killer smashing machine!
Aim for that spot in the middle of the back, the one I can never reach.
Whaa! Let's get out of here.
Wow! I wish I had that kind of flexibility.
Ahhh!
I need more power! They're cutting in! More power!
We need to get out of here.
Almost there.
We have to go now!
Almost there. Almost there!
Dad! Now!
Good-bye, Asami. I love you.
Dad!
Hiroshi's plan worked. There's our opening.
Today we stand on the precipice of history. For the past three years, we've fought  side by side to unite the Earth Empire and we've proven that no one can stand in our way.  Not even the Avatar. But our mission is not yet complete.  There is a grave injustice that must be corrected. As you all know, after the hundred year war, Avatar Aang,  along with Fire Lord Zuko stole Earth Empire land and formed the United Republic.  This land belongs to the people of the Earth Empire  and it's time to take it back. Republic City will be ours!
Are you ready to show the World  what a true super power looks like? 
I never could've done this without your help. After we claim victory, we can finally get married  and rule our Empire together. 
How's the evacuation coming? 
Could be better.  At this point we've evacuated almost... eighteen families.
Only eighteen?  There are millions of people in this city!
I said it could be better.
The problem is it's a voluntary evacuation and there aren't many volunteers.  They just don't feel like they're in any immediate danger. 
Guys!  Good!  You're all here.
What's with you interrupting my important meetings all the time? 
Su!  What are you-  you're okay!  I'm so sorry about Zaofu.  How did you escape? 
Opal, Bei Fong, and I rescued everyone but we had a run in with Kuvira.  We saw her super spirit weapon up close. Like, really close. Way too close.
Is she going to use it against Republic City?
Oh! And Zhu Li is on our side now. Actually, she never really switched sides. And I'm just gonna let her explain the whole thing, Zhu Li?
I knew she wouldn't stop at Zaofu!
My guess is, she's coming by rail. It's the only way she can transport that weapon.
Then we'll cut the rail lines.
I agree. But let's get as many citizens evacuated before we do.  Put out the announcement.  The evacuation is now mandatory.
We're on it.
Don't worry, Mr. President. I won't let Kuvira take our city.
Weld hotter! Tighten tighter!  The President said we only have two weeks to get these hummingbirds humming! 
Varrick, good,  you're here. Can I talk to you for a minute?
What is it? I'm busy inspiring my workers.
Well, I went to Zaofu and saved Su and her family... And guess who else we found...  Ha!
Zhu Li.
Now, isn't there something you wanted to say to her? Hmm?
Don't be so hard  on yourself. 
Apology accepted!  Now be a good assistant and  man the assembly line!
Attention citizens of Republic City, this is not a test.  An attack on our city is imminent. President Raiko has ordered a mandatory evacuation for all citizens. Please find your evacuation handbooks  and turn to sub-section one  dash two six.  There you will find  initial instructions for your area.  For example, if you live in Northwest-Vector-One, report to your primary meeting location  which would be at the Eastern entrance of the Southern Water Tribe Library.  There, you will choose a leader as specified in section one dash two eight. 
What's confusing? I'm giving very specific instructions.
Great, this is just what we need.
I got this. 
Hello, everyone. This is Prince Wu. Now I know you're all a little scared.  Believe me, I know what it's like to be afraid. I used to not be able to go to the bathroom by myself.  But if we let that fear control us,  none of us will ever be able to go to the bathroom, and then we all lose.  But the people of Republic City aren't losers, we're winners!  Winners that are going to get out of this city  in a calm and orderly fashion.  So I want you to grab your family, grab your neighbor,  grab that guy down the street  you don't know very well  and head to the nearest  bus, train, or ferry station.  We're going to get you out of here, safe and sound.
Good job, kid. You might not make such a bad king  after all.
Rohan's with the acolytes. They have the boat ready to leave.  Why aren't you all packed yet?
The kids and I have been talking and we decided we wanna stay. This is our city, and it's going to need all the help it can get.
Yeah! Only a coward flees his fate.
Thank you.  I'm sure Prince Wu could use your help with the evacuation.  And you three can help the other airbenders keep an eye on the Earth Empire troops from above.
Kuvira is gonna rue the day she messed with  Meelo! 
I still don't like having to abandon my office and the city.
Air Temple Island is the ideal location for your base of operations. And you'll be safe here.
There's something we need to discuss with you.
What is it? 
The four of us have been talking and... we want to take out Kuvira's spirit weapon before it gets too close to the city.
That sounds like a risk we don't need to take. The evacuation is on schedule and General Iroh is getting his army in place.
I know Iroh can go toe to toe with Kuvira's army, but that weapon- 
It's too powerful! It can destroy the city!
We can't let it get to our doorstep.
We'll sneak behind enemy lines and disable the weapon.
If it works, it'll even the playing field.
But if you get caught...
It's worth the risk.
I agree, and it might be our only shot at preventing an all out war.  Good luck. 
We'll head out tonight.
There's something out there. 
It's Kuvira's army!  They're a week early! Get the commander immediately,  and radio Republic City!
Guys, I see something.  Down there! 
Is that...? 
Kuvira.  She's already crossed into United Republic territory. She's a week early.
This doesn't make sense.  There aren't any train tracks this way.  How are they transporting that super weapon of theirs?
Apparently on a giant mecha-suit!
Did you know Kuvira  was building that thing?
Oh, did I forget to mention it? No! Of course I didn't know!
There's a flying bison up ahead.
The Avatar...
I know what happens next!  We gotta get outta here now!  Now!
Let them.  No one can stop us.
Korra, are you all right?  Why are you back so soon?
It's Kuvira.  Our intel was wrong. She must've known Zhu Li had the information.
What are you trying to say?
Kuvira's army is only a few hours away.
No, they can't be... we're not ready.
And that spirit weapon of hers is attached to a giant mecha-suit. It's over twenty-five stories tall!
Get General Iroh on the line and tell him the attack is happening today. We need to lock down this city. 
Pema, find Wu and get the remaining citizens to safety immediately!  We can't have innocent lives  in jeopardy.
What should we do? 
Let's go to my factory. Maybe we can get a few of those hummingbird suits up and running. 
We're coming with you.
I'll head to the front lines and help General Iroh.
Kuvira this is President Raiko. I order you to stand down.  Turn your army around and leave.
You're in no position to give orders.
Stand down or we will attack. 
I don't think you understand the power  I possess.  Let me make it clear.
This is exactly why I didn't want to build that weapon!
You have three seconds  or I wipe out your army. 
I have no choice.
Time's up.
Stop.  We surrender.  Republic City is yours.
Good.  Turn your army and the Avatar over to me and give Baatar your location.  He'll present you with our terms. 
I'm not surrendering!
I will.
Raiko surrendered.  It's down to us now.
How are we supposed to fight an entire army, a mecha-giant, and that crazy weapon?
We can't fight it, but maybe we can cripple it.  Zhu Li, when you were spying on Kuvira,  did you learn anything about that metal monster?
Guess Baatar Jr. is a better inventor than I thought.  Don't tell him I said that.
That's it! Baatar Jr. built it- he'll know how to take it down. I say we capture him and get him to talk.
Hmm... 
I know it's a long shot, but it's the only chance we have and if we don't- 
Korra.  I'm in.
We'll need a stealth team of airbenders to get in and out of Baatar's airship unnoticed. Tenzin, Bumi, Jinora, Kai- let's get moving.
What about me?
Sorry buddy, but this mission counts on everyone being as silent as possible. And your farts are just too much of a wild card.
I can be quiet!  Okay. Point taken.
Is everyone ready?
That's why before she finds out, you're going to tell us how to stop that mecha-giant, or else...
Let me talk to him. 
What's going on? Is everything all right?
Just a minute, Sir.  I'm telling you, I looked everywhere.
All right,  enough whispering! 
I'm ready to discuss the terms of the surrender with Baatar Jr. Where is he? 
Uh...  I'm not really sure.
Baatar... 
Why are you doing this? I know you set out to help better the World  but this is madness!
But at what cost? How many people have to lose their lives before Kuvira is satisfied?
I don't know what I did to hurt you, but whatever it was,  I'm sorry. When you left Zaofu, it broke my heart.  And our family has never been the same since.  Please, Baatar. Stop all of this and come home.  We want you back with us.
We're going about this all wrong.  You're right, I'm not going to physically hurt you if you don't talk.  But there is something I can do that will be even more painful.   I will take away the one thing you care for the most- Kuvira.
Kuvira might win.  She might chase us out of the city.  But you won't be around to enjoy the victory.  Because wherever I run, I'll take you.  I'm going to make it my life's mission  to never let you see the one you love again.  Is taking the city worth losing Kuvira forever?
I will. Unless you convince Kuvira to back off. You two will still have the Earth Empire, just leave the United Republic alone. 
For goodness sake,  give me that radio. Let me talk to her. 
Kuvira, this is Raiko. What kind of game are you playing?  You told me you would send Baatar over with your terms, and then he doesn't show.
What do you mean he didn't show?
According to your people, he's not on the airship.
If he's not on the airship then where is he?
Are you injured? 
Is the Avatar there with you now?
Find out  where that radio signal's coming from.
We've identified their position. 
You're right, this city isn't worth sacrificing our life together.  I love you, Baatar.
As soon as we work out terms with Kuvira, we'll let you out of here.
Guys!  She must have our location!  She's pointing that weapon right at us.
Everyone out! Now.  Now!
No! 
Keep the President safe.  I'm going to check for survivors.
All right, let's do this.  Saving the Bei Fongs and saving our love  because I vow to repair the rift that has grown betwixt us  and make us whole again!
You, zip it now.  I had enough of your babble on the ride in.
Yes, Ma'am.
Kuvira tore down all the domes.  Why would she do that? 
She's got a whole battalion of troops stationed there.  There's no way we'll be able to spot anything useful from here. We'll have to go in for a closer look.
Don't bother.  All the prisoners have been moved.
Uh, hey, Chief.
Hey, Chief.
Grandma Toph!
You were only up to my waist the last time we were together.
Oh, man!  Oh, I can't!  This can't be happening!
What? Do you have to pee  or something?
No, well, now maybe.  You're my hero! My name is Bolin. I'm dating your granddaughter,  I mean, kind of.  I may have screwed that up, but that's why I'm here,  and you're my hero! Oh, I said that. Can I have a hug too?
What's up with him?
He's an actor. So you already checked  the city for Su?  How did you know she was captured?
I've been living in The Swamp and keeping watch on Zaofu through the vines.
Sure, okay, makes sense.
By the time I got here, they were gone. I snooped around town and heard that they were taken away to some nearby prison camp.
Where would that be?
There's a factory and reeducation facility not too far away.
How do you know that?
Bolin used to work for Kuvira.
How did you end up dating the kind of dipstick  who works for Kuvira?
Used to!
It's not his silver tongue,  I can tell you that. 
Please tell me this attitude isn't hereditary.
Grandma, this is Juicy.
And I thought Appa was smelly. Why would you choose this leaky, nasty thing?
You don't choose your bison.  He chooses you. And once he chooses you,  you can't change. Believe me. I checked.
The borders are secure, and troops are guarding the rail lines into the city.  So, what have you two geniuses come up with to fend off Kuvira?
It's a flying mecha-suit!  Asami got the idea  from watching dragonfly-hummingbirds. You can take off straight up,  fly in any direction.
Where does the spirit ray come out?
It doesn't have a spirit ray.  I'm telling you what I told Kuvira: That technology should not  be used.
It's already being used by Kuvira! I need spirit vine weapons,  and I need them now!
No. It was Kuvira's harvesting of the vines in The Swamp that caused the Republic City vines to go crazy and grab all those people.
You're supposed to be the bridge between the two Worlds. Why can't you harvest the vines?
I won't do that, but maybe since the spirits love Republic Ccity so much, I can convince them to help us defend it somehow.
Hmm...
Okay,  maybe while the  weapon geniuses and  the spirit bridge  are getting ready for battle,  we should be evacuating the ordinary citizens so that if Kuvira attacks, they won't be hurt.
That's actually a good idea.  Prince Wu, you work with the police to coordinate getting people out of the city.  Now everyone get to it. I want daily updates.
Nice job in there.  I'm proud of you. You're starting to act like the kind of King I'd like to work for. 
Thanks.  And if Korra buys this "Man of the People" thing,  I still might get to date her.
You always have to ruin it.
What? Come on! Why do you think guys do anything great? To pick up girls. Every work of art, every song,  every city evacuation. All for the ladies. 
So how long has it been since you two have seen each other?
Little while now. Couple of years. 
Try twenty.
Ah, time flies when you get to be my age. I'm surprised you came to save Su. I thought you guys didn't get along.
Su and I finally worked out our old grievances.
Good,  glad we can put all that behind us.
Right. "We."
Okay,  there's the factory.
Whoa,  that's one big...  thing.
I think I know where they are.  Feel that cavern a few stories down?  It seems empty,  but it's guarded by an awful lot of mech.
Right. Why would you need soldiers guarding an empty cavern?  They must have them in some kind of suspended prison, so they can't use their earthbending.
Someone's coming. Hide!
I just wanted to check in to make sure everything was on track. It looks wonderful.
You've been working on this the entire time, Zhu Li.  What do you think the problem is?
But you're doing everything you can to fix those, correct?
She's lying. 
Tell the troops and factory workers to attend tomorrow's demonstration.  I want them all to witness this incredible new weapon in action.
We should be thinking of a way to take out Kuvira while we have the chance.
Or at least destroy the cannon.  If she takes that to Republic City, it could obliterate everything.
I didn't come to fight with Kuvira or destroy a cannon. I'm here to save my family.  It will take  everything we have just to get out alive.
Hmm. Kuvira wants every single one of her people to see the weapon test tomorrow, so the factory will be mostly empty then. That's our best chance  to sneak in and  free Su without being spotted.
Good thinking, Bolin.
Thanks.  I kind of have a headache now.
Excuse me, spirit? Can I talk to-  and you're gone.  Just like all the other spirits.  They're abandoning the city.
So let me ask you about metalbending. Su tried to teach me, but I couldn't get the hang of it.
I used to have an academy to train metalbending. Even blockheads like you can figure it out with the right instruction.
Yeah,  you're a real sensitive instructor.
I did learn how to lavabend.
Really? It's a very rare ability.  Maybe you do have some talent.
I can't believe you think I'm talented.  That means so much to me coming from my hero.
Yeah, she's real encouraging.
Hey, I'm blind, not deaf.
So here's something I've always been curious about. Who's Lin's Dad?
He was a guy named Kanto.  Nice man, but it didn't really work  out between us.
And... Okay.
Lin, I can feel your enraged breathing from here.  Just say what you have to say, and let's get it over with. 
Just get it over with?  Yeah, let's not linger on the fact that I grew up without a Dad. No need to get all touchy-feely about it. Just one of those things, right?
Hey, I forgave you for all your garbage a long time ago, and Su and I worked things out.  You're the only one who wants to hold on to this family drama nonsense for the rest of your life. 
Forgave me  for what?  And not knowing my Dad is nonsense to you?  It was pretty important to me.  And until now, you would never  even discuss it. You know, after Su and I patched things up,  I thought,  "Maybe I should try to reach out to Mom."  But now that we're together again, I remember why we stopped talking. You make me furious,  and you don't even know why. And when I tell you, you don't care.  Once we save Su, you and I are finished.
If that's your decision and it makes you happy, then fine.
The test is about to start. They're going to blow up that empty town  we flew over yesterday. You're clear to go.
Copy that. We're going in.
The guards are on the other side of that door.  We'll have to be quiet.
Shoot me over to the cage, and I can swing them back  on my cable.  Bolin, you'll have to catch them since Mom won't be able to see them.  Ready?
We'll get you out one at a time.  Come on.
I got you!
Congratulations on all of your hard work.  This weapon is proof that the Earth Empire is the strongest nation in the World. And believe me,  this is only the beginning!
Fire the weapon.
What's wrong?
And this could cause the entire weapon to fail?
What do you know about this?
You swore your loyalty to me, and I gave you a chance at greatness.  This is how you repay me?
Chain her up  in the target town. She can see how the weapon works  up close and personal.
Oh, no.
Sweetie, it'll be fine.  Lin won't drop you, and Bolin will catch you.
Sorry, but I have to do this.
Huh?
The prison. Get there now. 
I didn't come all this way to stop now.  Fire when ready. I want to see that town destroyed.
We got 'em! We're coming out.
Mom! Dad! 
Thank you.
Let's move.
Kuvira caught Zhu Li and  threw her in the town.
What? No, I have  to go save her.
You can't go in there, kid. It's suicide. Kuvira's onto us.
We've been through too much together. I can't leave her. Toph, you said Zhu Li was lying about fixing the cannon. She must have been trying to stop it.
For all you know, she could just have been covering her butt because she made a mistake.
No. Zhu Li doesn't make mistakes. You guys leave. If we make it out, we'll get to the city somehow. 
Bolin, no!
You guys get out of here. I have to go with Bolin.
Could be our best chance to stop Kuvira.
Maybe take out  that weapon.
We can't let Opal be the coolest.
If you all want to get yourselves captured again or worse, that's your business. I'm through. 
Watch out for Baatar Sr. and Huan.
I told you never to call me that. 
Spirits, this is the Avatar.  Please listen to me.  Since I opened the portals, spirits and humans have lived happily together in Republic City. It's all I could have hoped for.  I know you felt the effects of Kuvira cutting down spirit vines. But now isn't the time for you to flee the city.  It's time for you to help me save it from Kuvira,  who was perverting spirit power  to use as a weapon against other humans.
Spirits worked with Unalaq.
No, but as the Avatar, I'm hoping that you will come to my aid to save  the New World we all share.
Wait!  Please, listen. If spirits and humans are gonna live together,  we have to work with each other.
Whoa...
You give metalbenders a bad name!
Thanks for coming to save us, Mom.
Yeah, thanks, Chief.  I'm sorry for what I said last night. I was just... you know.
Look, I know I wasn't a great mother, but one way or another, I ended up with two great kids. Good enough to risk my bony old butt for, anyway.  If you can just find some way not to hate me, maybe that's enough, at least for me.
Me too.
You know, I never had any family  except for my brother  until a few years ago, and reuniting  with them made me realize how special it is-
Argh,  enough.  Enjoy the ride  back to the city with the gum flapper here.
Aren't you coming back to Republic City with us, Grandma?
No, my fighting days are over.  Don't tell Korra, but my back is killing me now. This is why you didn't see Katara messing with that Civil War nonsense.  At some point, you gotta leave it to the kids. 
I think Bolin   has worked his way out of the polar bear-doghouse. 
Yes!  Ha-ha!
Everyone, Mom, can we stay together, please? The tour's about to begin.
Mom, Dad, I'm trying to work.
Fun fact, everyone: All these vines were created by UnaVaatu when he battled Giant Spirit Korra  for the fate of the World. 
No.
No, can I just get through my cards?
I'm not!
Uh,  I don't see anything about that on the cards.
No! why would you do that?
Everyone back! 
Everything okay?
No. Kuvira has my family,  and no one seems to care but me.
We all care. Don't worry. We'll get them back safely.
Guys, there you are! I just felt a weird surge of spiritual energy coming from the Spirit Wilds.  Something's wrong. 
Are you sure you felt a disturbance?  Maybe you just had some bad food for breakfast.
I'm telling you. I felt it. Maybe something happened to Ryu's tour group.  We should've run into them by now.
Yeah, but it's Ryu. They might be at the mall for all we know.
Korra,  can't you feel how strange the energy is?
No, but...  Maybe I can get a reading.
Korra,  what is it? Are you okay?
It was Kuvira. I saw her taking vines from The Swamp. It must be affecting our Spirit Wilds.  I bet that's what you were sensing, Jinora.
Why is she taking vines?
Whatever the reason, I'm sure it's not good.
We have to tell Raiko. This might help him convince the other leaders to finally take her down.
I'll keep looking for Ryu and the others.
I say we deal with this Kuvira situation immediately.
Yes! Agreed! And I know just how to get rid of her:  We tell her she won an all-expense-paid vacation to a tropical island. Then when she gets there, we reveal it was a trap- the island's a prison! Boom! Got her! 
Or,  okay, uh, I'm just spitballing here.   We march in with an army of highly trained badgermoles! 
Do we know if Kuvira has any allergies?
Look, I think we all know what must be done. We take the fight to her.
I don't believe attacking is the right move, since she hasn't done anything aggressive toward the United Republic.
Not yet.  But Kuvira can't be trusted. She told us that she was going to turn over power, and she didn't. I'm with Raiko.  I say we go on the offensive and start by retaking Zaofu.
President Raiko,  I'm sorry to interrupt, but-  what's going on here?
Oh, hey, Avatar Korra.  Just kickin' it World leader style, trying to figure out what to do about Kuvira. For the record, I told Raiko  he should've invited you.
You invited him but not me?
Please, Korra, it's not personal. We just thought perhaps we called you back into action a little too soon.
Again-  him, not me?
Korra, we're in the middle of a meeting, and we can't have people just barge in whenever they want!
Guys!  Oh, perfect! You're all here! 
What are you doing here?! Guards,  remove these traitors!
No! We escaped Kuvira's army! We're back on your side now!  We have top secret information for you!
Okay, I guess we should have opened with that line.
Listen to me. Kuvira is making this thing that goes...  I don't know how it works, but it has this... 
It's a super weapon! Like a regular weapon, only super!
And let me guess. It has something to do with spirit vines.
Yes! How did you know?
I saw a vision of her taking spirit vines from The Swamp.
If she figures out how to harness their power, we are all doomed.
She might use the weapon to attack Republic City. The only way to protect ourselves  is with a preemptive strike.
My airbenders won't be part of an unprovoked attack.
But, Fire Lord Izumi, Kuvira is a threat to the World. She has to be stopped!
Fine. I'll hold off any plans of attack. We'll go on the defensive and fortify security on the borders.
Opal, wait!  Please, I just want to say that I'm sorry for everything.
I'm glad you're okay, but it's a little late for sorry.
I know, I know.  I didn't listen to you, and I sided with Kuvira, and I helped her take over the Earth Kingdom and topple your home and get your Mom captured  and your brothers and your Dad...  Wow, that does sound really bad when I say it out loud like that. But I'm gonna make it up to you.
Pardon me, lovebirds, but I need a word with Opal.  Privately. 
I'm sorry, kid, but Raiko couldn't convince the other leaders to attack Kuvira.
So our family...
Looks like we're going to have to save them ourselves.
Don't you think some other people would agree to go with us?
This is an unsanctioned and dangerous mission into enemy territory. We can't ask other people to risk their necks for our family. If we want to break them out, we'll have to do it alone.
Bolin, I'm so glad you're back.  I was worried about you. 
We all were. 
Thanks, guys. Mako, I'm so sorry about the way we left things.  I'm such an idiot. You tried to warn me about Kuvira, and I ran off anyway, like an idiot. You were right, and I'm just an idiot. I hope that I'll be able to earn your trust again.
If anyone has lost people's trust,  it's me. Ever since Kuvira kicked my butt, no one even wants me around.
We want you around.  And, Bolin, you're not an idiot.  You were just doing what you thought was right.
Aw, I love you guys. And I really want to hug again.
Agh!
Ugh!  Ahh!
Argh!
Korra! The vines! They're taking me!  Help!
Get everyone out of here! Put up a perimeter.  Cancel all tours.  Somebody get ahold of Tenzin. 
We got to get in there and find Jinora.
I don't think anyone should be going in there right now.
I know I'm not the old Avatar I used to be, but I can do this.
Be careful.
Jinora!
Hello? Anyone? 
Wait.  Do you hear that?
Come on!
Korra, look.  What are those?
It's Jinora and the rest of them. Their spirits are trapped in the Spirit World.
Let's get them out.
Don't!  You'll provoke the vines.  Let me try.
They won't open. Maybe if I meditate into the Spirit World, I can free them.
Wait... This isn't the Spirit World.
Zaheer! No!
You can't fight me and the poison.
No, I got it out.
You'll never get it out!
Korra!  What's wrong?
It's Zaheer.
What are you talking about?
He's been haunting me  ever since I fought him. I can't get any peace.  It's like he's blocking me  from meditating into the Spirit World. 
I'm here for you. What do you need?
I want to face Zaheer.
Korra, he's too dangerous. Even when he's locked up, he can't be trusted.
I need to if I want to save Jinora and the others; there's no other way.
There is another way. I'm calling your father. He can lead an expedition into the Spirit World from the Southern Portal.
You've lost faith in me too, haven't you?  No one thinks I'm capable of anything anymore.
It's not that at all.
I know I can do this.
I'm just so worried for Jinora. I can't imagine if something happened to you too.
Tenzin, please... I'll be okay.
Zaheer's imprisoned  deep in the mountains outside the city. I'll call Raiko and get the clearance.
Thank you.
Pab-pabs,  where are you?
Pabu!  Oh, I missed you so much!  So I don't know if you've heard, but Opal's kind of mad at me.  I was hoping you could help me win her back.
Awesome! Yes, I have an idea.
Hello, Pabu.  Well, it's good to see you too.  What do you got there?
Opal, you made it.
What's this?
A picnic, just for the two of us. Well, three of us.  Sorry, Pabs.
So this note Pabu brought me saying you broke both of your legs was just a ruse?
Maybe... But now that you're here, don't you want to just sit back, relax,  try some of my homemade steam buns-  Pema's recipe-  and watch Pabu  do some of his World famous backflips  for entertainment?  Ha-ha! 
Oh, steam buns- my favorite. This will totally make me forget that you worked for Kuvira, the person who captured my family and is probably torturing them right now.  So, yeah, let's just sit down  and have a great picnic because we're so in love!  I'm sorry you had to see that, Pabu.
Thank you both for coming.
It's nice to be welcomed back with open arms.
Actually, I brought you here out of necessity. It's no secret I never liked you,  especially after you tried to have me kidnapped.
Allegedly.
Right.  Everything you do is "allegedly", like when you took over my company and bombed the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center?
I own that building! A man has the right  to blow up his own property!
Right now, I need you to put aside your differences. If Kuvira really is creating a super weapon,  we're going to need the two brightest minds in the city working together to stop it.
What do you say, Asami?  Partners again?
Fine. I'll help.  But don't even think  about double-crossing me again.
Ow...  Uh-huh.
Are you sure you're ready for this?
Yes. I think if I see Zaheer chained up,  I'll finally realize that he's not a threat anymore.
Approach the wall.
No.  I need to do this alone.
I figured you would show up sooner or later.
So... You must really be in trouble if you came all the way down here to see me.
I came here to look you in the eye and tell you that you have no power over me. I will no longer be scared of you.
I guess it didn't work.  You still seem scared.
This was a mistake. 
I know why you're here. 
You don't know anything about me!
You can't go into the Spirit World.  I spend most of my time in the Spirit World,  and it's well-known that the Avatar's Spirit hasn't been there for a few years.
You can meditate into the Spirit World from here?  Doesn't feel very spiritually charged.
This is your problem. Republic City is flowing with spiritual energy, and you can't even tap into it.
No, my problem is  you. You poisoned  me!  You ruined me!  People used to think I was unstoppable, but now they don't think I'm capable of anything!
Blaming me is a crutch to make you feel better,  but it's not helping you recover.
I thought seeing you face-to-face would put an end to all of this,  but maybe it's time I realize I'll never be the same.
Neither of us are the same as before. I learned to fly,  but now I'm bound in chains. You have all the power in the World and the freedom to use it, but you choose to hold yourself down.
I'm not holding myself down, but my powers have limits.
You're wrong. That poison should've killed you, but you  were able to fight it off. You think your power has limits; I say it's limitless.
Whatever. Before, you were always talking about chaos and freedom. Then you took out the Earth Queen and created the worst dictator the Earth Kingdom has ever seen. Thanks for that.
I've heard rumors about her, but I didn't know she achieved so much power. She needs to be stopped.
Well, I can't stop her unless I get over this block.
I think I can help.  Let me lead you into the Spirit World.
No way.  I can't trust you.
Maybe not. But if you had any other options, you wouldn't be here now, would you?  We may have been enemies once, but for now, our interests align. 
I've come this far. What have I got to lose? 
Focus on the sound of my voice, and clear your mind.
Let it play out.
I can't!
You can.  Accept what happened to you. Don't fear what might have been.
I have no control!
Don't be afraid. Hold on.
I made it...  And you led me here.  Do you know where Jinora and the others are?
No, but you do. 
Raava, I missed you. Where have you been?
I have always been inside of you.
Can you help me find Jinora?
How do I release their spirits?
You must bend the energy within.
But I'm powerless in the Spirit World.
No, you're most powerful here.  In the Spirit World, you're connected to all the spiritual energy.
Uh... I feel all spirity.
Dad!
I'm so glad you're safe. What happened? How did you get out?
Korra saved us.
So... How are you doing?
I feel whole again. I feel good. 
Do you think you're finally able to forget about  what Zaheer did to you?
No.  But I am finally able to accept what happened,  and I think that's gonna make me stronger.
Where are you going?
We've got some family business  to take care of.
All right, listen, before you go, I just want to tell you that I understand how you feel. I know there's nothing I could do or no big gesture that can make up for all my mistakes,  but that doesn't mean I'm gonna stop trying to win you  back, because...  I love you.
Thanks for saying all of that.  You know,  there is one thing you could do to win me back.
What is it? Yes, I'll do anything!
Come on a secret mission with us.
Where to? 
Zaofu.  We're going to rescue my family.
You know, there's something about being kidnapped  that makes a guy realize he needs to get his act together.
Yeah, I agree.  Let's toughen you up.
Ahh! I wasn't ready!  Wu down!
What's going on? 
Mako,  how dare you injure the prince?  Would His Royal Highness like a cherry-berry lemonade? 
And maybe some  of those sticky dumplings too?
Look at you.  You're so weak, "Wu down" is your catchphrase.
I know, I'm a wimp. But it's not my fault. I was born that way. I'm not like you, Mako. I wasn't raised by a pack of cops in the woods.
You don't know anything about me, do you?
Yeah, I'm drawing a blank. Why is that?  How do I not know stuff about you?
Uh... you never asked?
Well, I'm asking now.  What's your favorite food? What's your favorite color? Is there a special lady in your life?
Not since Korra and I broke up.
What?  You dated the Avatar?  Sit.  You and I need to have a little gab session  right now.  How'd you guys first meet?
Bolin and I  were playing for the Fire Ferrets.
You were a pro-bender?
Yes. Will you just let me tell the story?
Carry on.
Bolin and I grew up dirt poor, so once I became a pro-bender, I wanted it all: Riches, fame, accolades.  But all that changed when I met Korra.
Come here. I want you meet my brother, Mako.
Mako? Wow, I heard you play on the radio.
Come on, Bolin, we're up.
Whoa, that was the first time you met? Kind of rude there, buddy.
Know what else is rude?  Interrupting. Korra proved to be an amazing pro-bender,  and a loyal friend. She helped me save Bolin when he was taken by the Equalists. 
After going through such a crazy experience,  I felt like Korra and I had a powerful connection.
So then you smooched her real good? Huh? Huh?
Erm... Not exactly.
Ah!
Oh, no. I'm so sorry. I didn't see you.
How could you not see me? I mean, I was ju- I was- I- I- wow.  That was- 
Wait. That was the first thing you said to Asami?  You really got to work on your introductions.
Hey, when you got charm like mine, you don't need introductions.  Hanging out with Asami was awesome,  but it made things with Korra... complicated.
So I was thinking we should spend some time together. Look, I really like you and I think we were meant for each other.
Korra, I'm really sorry but... I just don't feel the same way about you.
That's harsh, Mako. 
I know, and the worst part about it is, it wasn't totally true. 
We need to talk.
Save your breath. You've already made it clear how you feel about me.
No, I haven't. What I'm trying to say is... As much as you drive me crazy, I also think you're pretty amazing.
Hot dog! Smooch city here we come. You player.
Whoa. I thought you were dating Asami.
Tu,  get out of here!
Naughty Mako. You take after your grandfather.
Guys, Grandma, everything wasn't so cut and dry. I wasn't dating Asami.
Denial.
Okay, maybe I was dating her. It was all very confusing.  But my feelings for korra became clear when Tarrlok captured her. It felt like a piece of me was gone.
I was so worried. Are you all right?
I'm fine. I'm glad you're here.
Oof.  I bet Asami wasn't too happy about that.
I've noticed how you treat Korra... How you acted when she was missing. You have feelings for her, don't you?
Things are crazy right now. Can we deal with our relationship problems later?
Well, there might not be any relationship to worry about later.
Asami! 
Ouch.
Yup. turns out she was right. It was time to man up and call it quits.
Asami, I'm sorry things got so messed up between us. But whatever happens today, I want you to know how much I care about you.
I care about you too.
Wait, was that supposed to be you breaking up with her?
Yes. That was a breakup.
Didn't sound like a breakup.
It was mutual. We had an understanding.  We both knew-  Can I just get on with the rest of my story or what?
Fine. But I hope you weren't as ambiguous with Korra as you were with Asami.
Trust me, I wasn't.  Korra and I ended up stopping Amon together and after that, I was finally able to tell her how I felt. Exactly how I felt.
I love you, Korra.
I love you too.
Aww. And then you two lived happily ever after?
Um...
Tenzin's just trying to help you become the best Avatar you can be.
Of course you take his side.
I'm not taking his side.
You know, sometimes I wonder whose side you're on.
There aren't any sides.
How could you take his side?
What's with you and sides?
Well, excuse me, officer! Don't let me stand in the way of you writing tickets. I'm just trying to save the World!
Well, I guess that if we're both putting our jobs first, maybe there's no room for our relationship.
So what? Are you breaking up with me?
Yeah. I guess I am.
Now that's a breakup!
After that, I dove into my work. Someone had been taking out supply ships heading to the Southern Water Tribe.  Asami's company was one of the victims, so she and I worked together to catch the perps. The stakeout was the perfect way to get my mind off Korra.  It was an intense night. Asami and I discovered the triads had double crossed us. We barely got away,  but by then Asami's warehouse had been cleared out.
My company... It's over. I give up.
Well, I'm not giving up on you.
I know, I know. Don't tell me. I had no right kissing Asami.
No, actually, I'm completely fine with that. You officially broke up with Korra and therefore,  you're free to smooch whoever you wish.
If only it had been that simple.
Mako, I missed you so much!
Korra, hey, I missed you too. So you're not still mad at me? We had that fight before you left, remember?
Not really. I got attacked by a Dark Spirit and I lost my memory for a little while. Maybe it hasn't all come back yet. Was it a bad fight?
Ahh... Hmm... No. No. It wasn't that bad.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. So you were back with Asami, but then Korra came back and thought you guys were still together and you didn't tell her you weren't?!
Just like your grandfather.
Well, me and Asami were never officially back together.
Really? That again?  You know, it seems like you're so afraid to disappoint anyone that you end up disappointing everyone.
Truer  words have never been spoken. High five!
Well, eventually, I did tell Korra but by then she already knew.
Why didn't you just tell me the truth in the first place?
I know I should have, but... I didn't want to hurt you all over again. I guess part of me wanted to forget about the breakup too.
I think we both know that this... Us... doesn't work.
You're right.
It's over. For real this time.
After Harmonic Convergence, the World changed. Team Avatar traveled around searching for new airbenders.  At first, it was awkward being around Korra and Asami.
As you were. Ladies.
But then I realized I had to realize who I was without a lady in my life.
I know what that's like.  I mean, to need distance from women, because I have so many all over me, all the time.
Anyway,  I eventually helped Korra defeat Zaheer  and save the airbenders and we did it as friends.  Korra showed me the importance of putting others before myself.  And whenever I think of her, she continues to inspire me.
Wow.  That story is amazing and I really learned something.
You did?  Good.
Yeah, I learned that I really didn't know anything about you. Crazy! Also, I realized that ladies are complicated. No offense, grandma.
None taken.
I better just focus on being a better King.  Okay, come at me.  I can take it.  Ah! Wu down!
I brought you some tea.  I thought you might be cold out here.
You're so sweet.  Thanks. 
Are you okay? You seem out of sorts.
Sorry. I've just been thinking about something Toph said.  She told me that the World doesn't need me and it's basically pointless to try to stop Kuvira.
That's ridiculous.
At the time, I thought so too. I figured she was just being her normal, cranky self,  but I'm beginning to think she had a point.
No, she doesn't. The World does need you. You're the Avatar.
But no matter what I do, the World seems to always be out of balance.  Growing up, I couldn't wait to be the Avatar. I thought I was really gonna change things. I was so naive.  The first time I saw Amon take someone's bending away, I was terrified.
Your firebending is gone. Forever.
Then my worst nightmare came true.
Korra!
No! 
I told you I would destroy you.
Korra, you're forgetting about all the good that happened after you exposed Amon as the fraud he was. The Equalist movement lost its leader and its power.  Free elections were held in the United Republic and non-benders finally had a voice.  People had hope again and it was all because of you.
And I was hopeful too.  But that feeling didn't last long.  As soon as I defeated Amon, a new enemy took his place.
I can't believe I trusted you. You made me think you wanted to restore balance with the spirits, but this- this isn't balance. It's madness! Now let her go!
If you want your friend to make it out of the Spirit World, you'll open the other portal now.
Because of Unalaq, I betrayed Tenzin, opened the portals, and threw the sprit and human worlds into chaos. 
It was my fault he fused with Vaatu  and became a Dark Avatar. 
And I was helpless to stop him from destroying Raava and cutting off my connection to my past lives.  With Raava gone,  Unalaq and Vaatu became more powerful than ever.
But you became more powerful too.  I mean, you turned into a giant spirit.
Yeah, that was pretty awesome.
And opening the spirit portals turned out to be a good thing.  You brought back the airbenders and  caused a positive shift in the World.
Yes, but Zaheer got airbending too, and nearly killed me. 
If it weren't for Zaheer, the Earth Queen would still be alive. There would have been no crisis in the Earth Kingdom,  and Kuvira wouldn't be in power.  Things are more out of balance than ever now. Nothing's changed!
You're right, Korra.
I am?
She is?
It's true, there will always be new conflicts and enemies to face. But the important thing is to learn from your enemies and better yourself over time, which you have.  You've changed so much since you first arrived on Air Temple Island. When you first came here, you were hotheaded and a bit selfish.  But you've matured into a thoughtful young woman who puts the needs of others before herself.  The New Air Nation is a testament to that. You sacrificed everything to save them.  You're an inspiration to the World.
Thank you both.  I know that this Kuvira problem is only going to get worse.  But no matter what happens,  no matter how crazy things get,  I'll always try to restore balance.
And that's when I made a solemn vow never to eat bark-onion soup again.  Been six years, four months, and fourteen days-  Ugh. I can still taste it.
Does anyone else feel like throwing themselves overboard?
Not me!  I've spent the last few hours tuning out all these incredibly boring stories...
Hey!
All the while  mentally composing  the most exciting tale  ever told,  soon to become the greatest mover ever made!  I present to you now:  Bolin,  as Nuktuk, Hero of the South-  Trademark Varrimovers International-  In the  incredible true story of Bolin! Hero of the World!
Wait, am I playing Nuktuk, or is Nuktuk playing me?
Both. It's your true story, but we'll capitalize on the audience of the Nuktuk franchise. Duh.
How can you call me the Hero of the World?  I left my friends and family to join up with a psychotic dictator who imprisoned me, and now I'm running back home with my tail between my legs.
Nya, ba, ba, ba, ba. You're emphasizing the wrong story beats. Let me tell it. The story of Bolin begins in an exotic  port of call. A wise sage, the richest merchant in the World, and a handsome devil all sit  on a single pillow in the living room of a luxury yacht. How do they all fit on one pillow?
Ooh!  Giant pillow!
Wrong! They're all the same man! Me! I try to teach a Swami the power of levitation, but he's too stupid to understand it, so I kick him out. "Upon whom can I bestow my awesome knowledge?" I ask myself.  Then in walks Nuktuk with a twinkle in his eye, a gorgeous dame on his arm, and a song on his lips. He bursts into a rapturous melody-  "Where can I find  my teacher?"
Oh, come on!  I wasn't singing,  you were not levitating. And Asami is just a friend, thank you very much.  If you want to tell my true story, you should start from when I met Korra.  She came to the bending arena one fateful night...
This place is even more amazing than I imagined!
Name's Bolin, by the way.
Korra.
Boring!  When does the singing start?
There wasn't any singing!
You're onscreen talent, kid. Leave the storytelling to the masters.  So the trouble begins when the Avatar is trapped in the Spirit World.  The World's most evil villains realize that with Korra out of the way, the time is right to try  to take out Bolin.  So the worst of the worst team up. They're led by  Zaheer- Leader of Red Lotus and Master of the Skies!  A flying chaotic chaos machine! He's joined by  Vaatu- The ultimate force of pure spirit evil in the universe! The biggest, meanest, scariest kite that ever flew! 
Wait, Zaheer didn't team up with Vaatu. How would that even happen?
How do you think? 
Hello?
Hey, it's Zaheer.
Oh, hey, Zaheer.
Glad I caught you at home. 
Uh-huh. Very funny. Like I can leave this stupid tree.
Hold on. Let me conference in-
Amon! The reanimated zombie body  of the bloodbending leader of the equalists!
Hey, guys, I'm totally in for taking out Bolin. He's way too powerful and awesome. But can we please not include-
The Evil Unalaq! The diabolical but incredibly boring and unpopular sorcerer from the North, who's listening in on the other line!
Yes, Bolin had a reputation as the World's greatest  ladies' man.
Ooh, now the story's getting interesting.
After leaving the beautiful but emotionally unstable Water Tribe princess  at the altar, he met  a fetching airbender, the heir to a vast Earth Kingdom fortune.
Opal, so smart and caring. So pretty to smell...  And she'll probably never talk to me again because I'm so stupid! Stupid! So, so, so stupid!
Pull it together, you leaky lug.  But the darkest moment is always right before the dawn. For at his lowest point, Bolin sought advice from the man who started it all, the wisest of the wise-  me! For some of my signature sage advice!  Nuktuk, I mean, Bolin, there's only one thing for you to do  if you want to save the Avatar and defeat the Fearsome Foursome.  I'm not really sure if I like "fearsome." I mean, Evil Square might be better. Whatever.  You have to assemble the fightingest airbender army of all time!  But it turns out the airbender recruits are a sorry lot, so Bolin brings them to a secret mountaintop training facility where he teaches them the ancient art of dodging fruit and balancing on sticks! Meanwhile, back with Zombie Amon...
Okay, guys, I think we finally ditched him.
And with danger closing in, Opal realizes how much she loves Bolin and forgives him for whatever stuff he was talking about earlier  which will probably not be in the final cut of the mover anyway.
She does?
And she kisses Bolin, magically passing on the airbender power of flight!
Okay, that part seems a little unbelievable.
This is no time for thinking, kid.  We're heading into the big finale!  Bolin gathers his airbender army to fight alongside  Rotan and Juji against the Terror Square!  Maybe that's the name of the bad guys- Terror Square. What about Legion of Darkness? Well, we'll put a focus group on it.  Bolin teaches the airbenders to create a giant tornado.  Then he flies around in the sky,  pushes Zaheer into it, turning him into wind forever!  But Bolin doesn't realize that the universal interplanetary  combination zero hour- talk about a ticking clock- is almost upon him!  And when Juji shoots his laser eyes at the Evil Unalaq,  the beams accidentally fly into the magic spirit doorway! They bounce off Vaatu, setting him free, and hit Bolin,  turning him into a giant!  But when Vaatu is set free, the Evil Unalaq, who has always been an annoyingly clingy person, is so close to Vaatu that they combine into one  horrifying monster!  Giant Bolin and the Evil UnaVaatu fight toe-to-toe, zapping each other with their laser beams as they stomp around Republic City.  It looks like the Evil UnaVaatu might win, but thankfully, Bolin's spiritual mojo  is so strong that he attracts the Queen of the Fairies!  With her help,  Bolin turns UnaVaatu into magic dust and sprays him into the sky. And that's where the stars come from.  Oh, yeah, and he turns into a dragon, and he goes into the Spirit World and saves the Avatar.  The end!
Wait.  You like that?  It didn't make any sense!  What about zombie Amon? What happened to him, huh?  And-and-and-and stars are magic fairy dust?  Are you guys crazy?  Are you crazy?
It's just a mover.  Don't overthink it. It's like a ride.
Never let the truth  get in the way of a good story, kid.
Are you sure this will work?  Even without Kuvira, they could still crush us.
Most of this army has been forced into service by Kuvira. If we take her out, they'll have no reason to fight.  Tonight we end her reign of terror. 
She's alone in there. Now's our chance.
Zhu Li?
I knew you'd try a sneak attack.  You were afraid to step up and lead the Earth Kingdom when you had the chance, you were afraid  to join me when I became the leader, and now you're afraid of a fair fight.  You've always been a coward.  Take them.
Korra, you have to go stop Su before she does something terrible!
Stop her? We should be helping her!
We have no idea where your Mom is or what her plan is.  If we go charging into Kuvira's camp, we could get them all captured or worse.  All we can do now is wait.
Attention, citizens  of Zaofu.  Your leader,  Su Bei Fong, attempted to attack me tonight while I slept,  ignoring the terms of our truce. Luckily, I now have her  and her assault team in custody.
No.
Rest assured  that I will not take revenge on the peaceful citizens of Zaofu, as long as your remaining representatives  meet me outside the city at dawn to offer the full  and unconditional surrender of your city. That is all. 
Korra, you can't let Kuvira  get away with this! We have to go break out Mom and my brothers!
You swore an oath  of non-aggression when you became an airbender.  You can't just attack Kuvira.
I don't care about the oath. I have to save my family!
No,  Jinora is right. Your mom attacked the camp. Kuvira was just defending herself.
Defending herself?  She was going to attack our city! I can't believe  you're refusing to fight. 
Why is that loudspeaker lady  talking when I'm trying to sleep?
Jinora and I will go talk to Kuvira at dawn, and maybe we can work something out.  I promise I'll do everything I can to keep the peace.
I'll go with you.
We'll go, too. 
No.  Dad told us to find Korra, and we found her.  Now you need to stay safe.
Come on, let us help.
I can't risk anyone else being captured.  You can stay with Baatar and Huan while I work this out with Kuvira.  Make sure   they get back to Tenzin safely if anything goes wrong. 
Aw, man. When am I gonna see some action?
Cookie jar empty.  No hot towels. Waxy buildup.  Zhu Li!
Aw, she really is gone. 
Zhu Li always greeted me in the morning with a-  hot cup of tea. 
Well, I'm really only productive  for about fifteen minutes a day,  usually in the afternoon around 3:45. 
What's going on?
I can't be expected to work without an assistant. Without Zhu Li, I'm helpless.
Well, I guess he'll be fine, as long as  he doesn't need his hands afterwards. 
What's he talking about, Sir?
The last time we worked with the spirit vines, it created an uncontrollable blast  that burned through a wall and could still be blowing up  comets in space, as far as I know.  I wouldn't want to assist me if I were you.
Maybe we should just let  the kid help him out. 
Wait, what?  I need my hands!  Uh,  hold on. Can we get breakfast first?  While we still have hands?
Release them now!
If Su agrees to bow to me and turn over Zaofu, she and the rest of  your family will not be harmed.
Never! I'll never bow to you!
There must be some way for us to resolve this.
I've already laid out my terms, and I think they're very reasonable. After all, Su did try to take me out during our peaceful negotiations.
You call bringing an army to threaten our city peaceful?!
Where's Bolin? I know he would never go along with this!
Bolin is with my fiance, working on something very important,  but I assure you he's on board with my plans. You two have been apart  for some time. I guess you don't realize how much Bolin has grown up.  Now turn over Zaofu.
I can't just let you take the city!
Avatar Korra,  you are interfering with internal Earth Empire business and letting your personal feelings get in the way of reason.  Zaofu cannot continue to rule itself. They have been hoarding their riches and technology too long.  I'm here to distribute those resources fairly throughout the nation. This is about equality.
You don't care about equality! This is about control!  Just take her down. You know it's the right thing to do. You have to stop this!
The only way you're going to keep me from marching into Zaofu is if you physically stop me.  Now what are you going to do?
It looks like you're not giving me a choice.
Fine.  I want you all  to know that I would never ask any of you to do something that I'm not willing to do myself.  So rather than risk your lives, I will fight the Avatar one-on-one.  Korra, if you win, then you can do whatever you want with Zaofu.  But after I beat you, I want you out of my business for good. I'm the one who brought peace to the Earth Empire,  not you. You're not relevant here anymore.
Fine. You want to fight the Avatar? Then let's finish this right here, right now!
Are you really ready to fight her?
Just stay back and let me handle this. It's been a while, but I got a lot of pent-up rage.
Don't mess around. Kuvira is too good. Just go into the Avatar State and get it over with. 
No, I'm only going to use that as a last resort.
Be careful.
Use whatever you want, all the elements, the Avatar State, anything you need.  I know you're a little rusty.
Enough talk.
Looks like the Avatar is a little off her game.
Don't let her get you frustrated! She wants you to make a mistake!
Bolin, do the thing.
What thing? 
The thing!  I never had to tell Zhu Li what thing!
I'm not Zhu Li, okay?  Pretend I don't know anything about anything that's happening here. Also pretend I don't want to build a super weapon or get my hands blown off.
You know, when I started working with the vines,  the point was to find a clean, unlimited source of energy, not develop some spirity death ray.
Clean energy, sounds great! Who doesn't like that stuff? Let's do that instead.
How would you know? You couldn't discover a wolf-bat if it was building a nest in your butt.
Ooh.
Ooh, you got me there, Dr. Science.  You'll never know how  it feels to give birth to genius, only to have it kidnapped and raised by fools.
Okay, okay, okay.  The last time  we ran the current through the vine,  we couldn't control the power.  So I'm trying something new to see if I can direct it.
Come on, Avatar. Get up! Show me what you've got.
We have to help her.
No. Stay back.  I can handle this.
Hand me  the screw-turn-thingy, would ya?
Ugh, I can't believe you're helping them.  You know this isn't right.
Funny story, Bolin. I first got the idea for harnessing spirit power  when I watched that giant Unalaq monster attack the city from my jail cell. That giant monster set me free.  Trust me, kid. I know what I'm doing. 
That ought to do it.  Huh.  Okay, stand back.  There we go. 
That's the timer.
For the bomb, of course!
What?! What bomb?
The bomb that's going to explode in five minutes and destroy this entire train,  all of the spirit vines, and everything else within a few hundred yards.  You know what, I'd get out of here if I were you.  This is the first time I've built a timer, and it might run a little fast.  Bolin and I are ready to go down with the ship- or train in this case- but you seem like you have a lot to live for.
No, no, no, no! I'm not ready to go down with the ship  or the train!
Stick around five minutes, and you'll find out who's bluffing.  You'll be sorry you left me,  Zhu Li!  When they write the history books, your name will be synonymous  with betrayal! People will say,  "Hey, what happened to that guy?" "Oh, didn't you hear, he Varrick'd himself because some girl Zhu Li'd him!"
You try  to pull me away from this thing,  and I'll hit this remote and blow it immediately.
Well, first I built the timer, but then I thought you could drag me  off the train, so then  I built a remote. But then I thought, "Well now, do I really need the timer anymore? Because I got a remote in my"-  Whatever! I'm covering all my bases! The point is,  you're leaving!  We're staying!
You have to go into the Avatar State! Do it!
I don't understand. We got the poison out. What's wrong with her?
I knew you were weak.
You broke our agreement! Attack!
Keep them back! I'm calling for help. 
Stunning work, Ikki. It hurts my eyes with its raw emotional power. 
Ah, pedestrian.  I already know what you look like on the outside.  I want you to show me the Inner Meelo.
Help!  You have to get Korra and the rest of us out of here now!  Hurry!
Finally!  Let's get it on!
This is everyone. Our half of the train is clear.
That's good. We're almost out of time.
You knew that when you hired me. Bolin, do the thing.
Uh...
Unhook the cars! Oh, come on, that was an easy one!
Man, that was great! I gotta admit, you had me going there for a while. I really thought you were going to blow us up. Now, how do we turn this thing off?
Oh, we can't turn  it off. We're going to blow up.  But we had a pretty good run, right?
What are you talking about, a good run? I'm still running! I like running!
I'll see you on the other side,  Zhu Li. 
I want you to know, I hate you.
Yes!  You did it,  Bolin!  You did the thing!  Mwah! 
I can't believe Zhu Li worked for you as long as she did.
Dive, Pepper!  Dive!  Here comes a hurricane!  You can't  handle all this  Meelo!
We've got her!  Go!
We have to save them! 
Opal,  get out of here! We'll be fine!  Just go!
I'll be back for you!  I love you!
Zaofu is ours!
Bring the citizens of Zaofu  to kneel before The Great Uniter.  All who pledge their loyalty to me will keep their freedom and be dealt with fairly  as full citizens of the  Earth Empire. The rest will be imprisoned  as traitors, like Su Bei Fong and her sons. Now bow.
Get your hands off me.  You're crushing my individuality.
Are you sure  there's no way  they survived?
How would you like to help Baatar build the most powerful weapon  the World has ever seen?
Begin dismantling the domes.
Naga! 
I missed you so much, girl.
Mom! Dad!  We're back! And we got Korra! 
Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes!  Bum-Ju and I  sure  missed you. 
It's so great to see you again, Bumi. And you too, Bum-Ju. 
Well done, kids. I'm proud of you all for finding Korra.
Proud enough to get me  my tats? 
No. 
Welcome home. 
I missed you, Tenzin. 
Now, I hate to get right down to business, but I want to hear what happened in Zaofu.
Way to ruin the moment.
Kuvira's whole army was there. She captured Mom, Dad, and my brothers.
I thought I was strong enough to stop her. I feel like such a failure.
No one expected you to handle Kuvira on your own. It's up to all of us to find a way to deal with her.  We're just glad to have you back.
Where's Bolin? He's not still on Kuvira's side, is he?
I can't believe he would stay with her after what she did to my family.  But we don't know where he is.
How about  you use your own legs for a while?
You know, when I fled Republic City with Zhu Li,  she carried me  twenty miles in one day. And that was after she sprained her ankle.
Well, Zhu Li's not here,  okay?! 
That's fine.  Leave me here. Let the worms gobble me up. I deserve it. 
No way, mister.  You're not getting off that easily.  You're responsible for that weapon Kuvira's trying to make. Which, may I remind you, could hurt a lot of people!
No, don't remind me!  I know, I'm a horrible,  horrible person. 
Okay, look, Kuvira fooled us both into doing her dirty work and I'm not happy about it either.  But you know how we're gonna make it up to the World?  By getting back to Republic City and warning everyone what she's up to.  So I want you to take my hand, and march with me out of this forest! 
You really have a way with words, kid.  No wonder I made you a mover star. All right,  I'll take the driver's seat for a while.  Hop on.
Great.  My feet could use a break.
Okay. Oh, boy.  Here we go.
Ah! 
Oh!
Are you kidding me?!
I hope  you haven't been waiting long.
Only three years.  It's so good to see you again.
You too.
And I'm loving the hair.
Thanks.  You're looking snazzy as always.
Come on,  Mako got us a table at the restaurant.
Korra! 
Hi, Mako.
Hello there,  Prince Wu, rightful heir to the throne,  and  this guy's boss.  I bet he's told you a lot about me.
Nope. Not a thing.
Then we have so much  to talk about.  You are going to love the food here. I know the chef personally.  Let's start with a round of your spicy octopus fritters. And keep  the cucumber-aloe water flowing.  Got to keep this princely skin hydrated. 
I thought it was just going to be the three of us.
Sorry, I couldn't ditch him. But he promised to be on his best behavior.
Hey, pop into the Avatar State for me. I want to see your eyes glow.
What?  No.
So can you go into the Avatar State again?  I was worried when you told me you couldn't.
Wait.  When did she tell you she couldn't? 
What's going on with you two?
I wrote to Asami while I was away. I asked her not to tell you. I'm sorry.
Well, why didn't you ever write to me? Or Bolin?
I don't know.  I guess I didn't know what to say.
A "hello" would have been nice.
Mako, if it makes you feel any better, she didn't write me either.
Why would she...  Never mind.
I'm sorry I didn't stay in touch, but I'm back now. And I want to know everything about what's been going on with you two.
Well, I kind of have some big news.  I went to visit my father for the first time. He'd been writing me letters and I guess I finally felt ready to try and forgive him.
You sure you can trust him? He might just be manipulating you again.
You think I don't know what my own father is capable of?!
No. No, I didn't mean-
You don't get to disappear for three years and then act like you know what's best for me.
It's not like I planned to be gone that long. I wanted to come back, but I never felt ready until now.
As much as I'm enjoying this little catch-up, my royal bladder is about to explode.  Mako?  Come on, I need you to stand guard.
I'm not gonna hold your hand every time you have to empty your royal bladder. Go to the bathroom on your own for once.
Fine. 
Do you always go to the bathroom with him?
I don't go "with him" with him.  I just stand there in the general vicinity while he-  I don't want to talk about it.
Make it a double, buddy. 
Mako, help!  Wu down.  Wu... down.
Ugh.  I wish Pabu were here. He could just chew us out of this.
You know  who else has incisors sharp as a knife? Zhu Li.
Well, look what we caught.  Wonder if they were tracking us after we escaped.
Hello, fellow travelers! I don't suppose you could help us out of this net?
Why would we free a couple of lowly Earth Empire soldiers?
Lowly? We were part of Kuvira's inner circle!
Were! Not anymore. We jumped ship. Please just let us out.
I think I know  just what to do with a couple of Kuvira's top men. 
I wonder what's taking Wu so long. He's not one to miss out on lunch.  I'll go check on him. 
Wu, you in here?  Come on,  your octopus fritters are getting cold.
I'll be right back. 
Excuse me, did you happen to see if Prince Wu came out this way?
Hmm.  I'm in laundry. 
Ah!
They've got Wu!  Get the car,  I'm going  after them!
Get in!
We're losing them!
Hang a right at the next block. We can cut them off on seventh. 
You missed the turn!  Where are you going?
I know these streets better than you. I built some of them. 
What are you doing?!  Sit down!
Where is he?
Wu's not here. This guy was the only one in the truck.
Where's the Prince?
They must have moved Wu to a different vehicle  when we lost sight of them.
Take this guy in for booking. Charge him with kidnapping. And tell Chief Bei Fong that Prince Wu is missing. Put out an all points bulletin. We'll keep looking. 
Where do we start? There are thousands of cars in the city and he could be in any one of them.
Or they might try  smuggling him out on an airship.
Or maybe a boat.
He could be anywhere! Ugh! The one time I don't watch him pee and  this is what happens!
They're taking Wu  to the train station!
Are you sure? How do you know?
I'll explain on the way, just drive!  We're running out of time!
So how did a bunch of water and fire benders  end up in one of Kuvira's reeducation camps?
Call it what it is- a prison.
Kuvira's been purging states of anyone who's not of Earth Kingdom origin and locking them up.
Purging?
What are you acting so surprised for?  You must have known what she was up to, being part of her "inner circle" and all.
No, I swear. And the inner circle thing lasted, like,  less than a day.
Will you at least tell us where you're taking us?
The border checkpoint. You're gonna help us talk our way past some Earth Empire soldiers.
And once we're through, we'll see about letting you go.
Ha ha! Lava time!  Bet you didn't expect that!
Look,  I'm sorry  for what happened to all of you, but as I've been trying to explain, we don't work for Kuvira anymore.
Yeah, if our handsome mugs get recognized trying to go through that checkpoint, we're goners!
If you really are fugitives, you better listen up! We've been scouting this region for days.  There's a wall stretching along the entire border  and patrols guarding every part of it. That checkpoint is our only way out.
It's not worth the risk, Baraz. How do we know they won't turn us in?
If he wanted us gone, we'd be at the bottom of a pool of lava right now. If any of us want to get out of the Earth Empire alive, we'll have to trust each other.
All right, where's this checkpoint?
So how do you know where Wu is just by touching some spirit vines?
I earned how to connect to people's energy through them.
Who taught you that?
Lin's mom.  I found her in The Swamp. That place is like one giant Spirit Wild. 
You met Toph? What was she like? 
A cranky, more miserable version of Lin.
Is that even possible?
You'd be surprised.
Which train is Wu on?
I don't know!
Split up and start looking.
Follow my lead.
You sure can.  We captured these escaped prisoners. We need to get them to a secure facility.
Camp 14.
You think we don't know where Camp 14 is?  Kuvira wants them transferred.
Listen, pal, I had to fight off 2 badger-moles, 6 wolf-bats, and 18 hog-monkeys to get these guys.  So sorry if I don't have the paperwork. I was too busy cramming it in a hog-monkey's mouth while it was trying to eat me.  I am in sore need of a shower and  I have blisters that are the size of cantaloupes  and twice as juicy!  So you can let us through, or you can give me your name and rank and I'll pass it on to Kuvira. You know what happens to soldiers who question her orders, don't you? Bad stuff!
There's no way I'm going back to prison!
Hahaha!
Boy, I sure hope this works. 
Hahaha! I still got that Varrick touch. 
We're clear. Come on!
Varrick, wait! We can't leave them.
Thanks. You didn't have to come back.
Yeah, I kind of did. Let's go.
If we don't find Wu soon, we might never find him.
He's on that train!
How do you know for sure he's here?
I don't. But I had a feeling, okay?
And I'm just supposed to trust "Avatar feelings"?
You wouldn't have to if you had guarded the prince like you were supposed to!
Oh, so it's my fault Wu disappeared.
It's certainly not mine!
Guys, shh. Listen. 
Wu! Wu, it's me.
Mako? Where am I? Am I dead? 
No, you're on a train. We're gonna get you out of here.
Everyone out.
I'm not going up there!
Jump!
You all right? 
Yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. You are definitely getting a raise, buddy.
You should be thanking Korra. We never would have found you without her.
I owe you my life, Avatar. If only there was some way to repay you. Ooh, I know.  How about I take you out for a night on the town?
Really? You're asking me out right now?
So...  I'll put you down for a "maybe"?
How about a never? 
Not exactly what I imagined for our first day back together.
But it was kind of like old times. Except for the getting on each other's nerves part.
Actually, that is like old times for me and Korra.
I'm sorry things got so tense earlier.
It's all right. I guess after being apart for three years, there's bound to be a bit of an adjustment period.
Yeah, but it's great to have you back.
There's no place else I'd rather be.
Mmph. You guys are the greatest friends a guy could have.
So what are we gonna do with him? It's too dangerous to take him back to the hotel.
Whoo. You're telling me! I need a cushy safe house somewhere.
I think I know just the place.
Nice digs, Mako. You didn't tell me you came from money.
I don't. This is Asami's place. She was nice enough to let my family stay here after they fled Ba Sing Se.
Mako! It's so wonderful to-  are you...
Grandma, this is Prince Wu. He needs to stay with you and the family for a little while.
It's an honor, Grandma Mako.
She loves royalty.
I think I'll fit right in here. Thanks for looking out for me, Mako. Now where's the nearest bathroom? I have been holding it all day!
I know it might not mean much coming from a guy wearing this uniform, but I'd like to apologize for what Kuvira's put you through.
I appreciate that.
Guess this is where we part ways. 
It's been a blast!
We're heading North too. Why don't you come with us? It's the least we can do after you saved our necks.
On that hunk of junk? No thanks. I'm allergic to drowning.  Oof! I mean, uh, we'd love a lift! 
Ew. Uh.
Perfect. Harvest these vines until there's nothing left.
What's the big idea with making me train this early in the morning? The morning is evil.
We're the rookies so we get the worst time slot in the gym.
And you're the rookiest of us all. We gotta get you up to speed if you want to survive in the tournament. Deal with it!
You deal with it!
There are my little hard working street urchins.  It's an honor to finally meet you, Avatar. 
And you are...
Butakha! I run this whole Probending shebang.  Here's your winnings from last match.  Ah-ah! Not so fast. First, you owe me for the Avatar's new gear, ha, gym and equipment rentals for last month. Ah-ah! Rent on your apartment, and a personal loan for groceries.
What? I'm a growing boy! 
Oh! And one more small item of business. The Fire Ferrets need to ante up thirty thousand yuans for the Championship pot.
Thirty thousand yuans!?
Sorry, kids. You've got till the end of the week to come up with the dough, or else, you're out of the tournament.
You wouldn't happen to have a secret Avatar bank account, over-flowing with gold, would you?
I got nothing. I've never really needed money. I've always had people taking care of me.
Then I wouldn't say you have nothing. 
Sorry, I didn't mean...
No, it's alright. It's just... ever since we lost our parents, we've been on our own.
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.
So anyway, how are we going to come up with the money?
Oh! Oh! I got it!  I've been training Pabu to do circus tricks. Now people would pay good money to see that.
Come on, Bolin. We need serious ideas.
I was serious.
Don't worry about it. I'll figure something out. I always do.
Come one, come all! Come see Pabu, the Fantastic Fire Ferret as he crosses the ladder of peril! Gasp! Upside down.  Psst.  Big finish, buddy. Stick the landing.  Ta da!  Thank you ladies and gentlemen! You are too kind. Seriously, too kind. You can come back here and put money in this,  Okay that's fine. That's fine. One yuan down, twenty-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine to go.
Oh, hey there, Shady Shin.
Heard you're a big time pro-bending player now. Not bad.
Uh, thanks.
So listen, I've got an offer for you. Lightening Bolt Zolt is looking to hire some extra muscle.
Uh, I don't know, Shin. Mako told me to stay away from the Triple Threats.
Pft, your brother ain't the boss o'you. It's just a little security work. Nothin' crooked.
Gasp!
You game?
Bo! I'm back! Picked up your favorite dumplings.  Ugh. Hey, I found some work down at the power plant. It's some decent money.  Bolin? You here, bro? Huh.  I bet the little lovebird is making a house call.
Good! Light on your feet!
Ooo, he's cute.
Korra, is that the handsome firebender boy that drives you crazy?
Does he drive you crazy in a bad way? Or does he drive you crazy like you like him? 
Ahem. Oh, hey, Mako.
Have you seen Bolin?
Nice to see you to. And no, I haven't seen him since practice. Think somethingís wrong?
I don't know.  Bolin has a knack for getting into stupid situations. Sigh See you later.
Wait! I could, uh, help you look for him.
Nah, I got it.
Hey, Cool Guy. Let me help you. We can take Naga.
Who's Naga?
My best friend! And a great tracker.
Your best friend is a polar bear dog. Somehow that makes perfect sense.
I'll take that as a compliment, city boy.
Well, this is his usual hangout.  You guys seen my brother around here today?
Perhaps. My memory is a little, foggy.  Maybe you can help, clear it up. 
You're good, Skoochy. Huh. A real pro.
Yeah, I seen him.
When?
'Bout noon.
What was he doing?
He was performing some kind of monkey-rat circus. And then...
And then what? Why'd he leave?
Shady Shin showed up and flashed some serious cash. Bo took off with him in his hot rod. The Triple Threats, the Red Monsoons, the Agni Kais, all the triads are muscling up for something real big. Now that's all you're getting outta me!
What's he talking about?
Sounds like there's a turf war brewing. And Bolin's about to get caught right in the middle of it.
So where are we headed?
The Triple Threat Triads' headquarters. Hopefully Bolin's there and nothing's gone down yet.
Triple Threat Triad? I beat up some of those yahoos when I got into town. Why would Bolin get tangled up with--  Whoa, Naga!
That's Pabu!
No, Naga! Pabu's a friend, not a snack.
We gotta hurry.
Something's not right. There are usually thugs posted out front. We better be cautious.  Bolin? You in here?
Bolin!
Naga, come!
Argh! I can't bend!  I can't bend!
Calm down, it'll wear off. Those guys were chi blockers. They're Amon's henchmen.
Amon? That anti-bending guy with the mask?
Yeah, he's the leader of the Equalists.
What do they want with the Triple Threats?
Whatever it is, it can't be good.  Ugh, I can't believe Bolin got himself into this mess!
Mako, we are going to save your brother. I promise you that.
We've been out all night. No sign of him.
We've got to keep looking. But where?
I have an idea!
The first day I got into town I ran into an Equalist protester over there. 
And you think he'll know where Bolin is?
It's our only lead right now.
So why is Bolin running around with the Triple Threat Triad, anyway?
Well we, we used to do some work for them back in the day.
What!?  Are you some kind of criminal?
No. You don't know what you're talking about. I just ran numbers for them and stuff. We were orphans out on the street. I did what I had to do to survive and protect my little brother.
I'm sorry. It must have been really hard. Can I ask what happened to your parents?
They were mugged. By a Firebender. He cut them down right in front of me. I was eight.
Mako.
Bolin's the only family I have left. And if anything happened to him...
Equality now! Equality now! We want equality now!
Non-benders of Republic City...
That's the guy.
...Amon calls you to action! Take back your city! It's time for the --  It's you again! You can not silence me, Avatar.
Shut your yapper and listen up. My friend got kidnapped by some chi-blockers. Where'd they take him?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Oh, I think you do.
Witness the revelation, tonight, nine o'clock. What's the revelation?
Nothing that concerns the likes of you two!
You better believe it concerns us. Spill it.
No one knows what the revelation is. And I have no idea what happened to your friend. But if he's a bender then my bet is he's getting what's coming to him.
Where's it happening?
Hey! What's going on over there?
The Avatar is oppressing us! Help!
Let's scram.
Why didn't the Equalists put a location on these?
Probably 'cause they don't want just anyone walking in on their big revelation, whatever that is. I bet the information is hidden on here somehow. Look at the backs.  There's four different images. 
So, it's a puzzle?
Yeah, of a map!  Bingo! That must be where it's going down.
This is the place.
What are you doing?
We'll attract less attention this way.
This is a private event. No one gets in without an invitation.
Uh, invitation?
You mean, this?
The revelation is upon us, my brother and sister. 
I knew a lot of people hated benders but I've never seen so many in one place.  Keep your eyes out for Bolin.
Please welcome, your hero, your savior, Amon!
My quest for equality began many years ago.  When I was a boy, my family and I lived on a small farm. We weren't rich and none of us were benders. This made us very easy targets for the Firebender who extorted my father.  One day, my father confronted this man. But when he did, that Firebender took my family from me. Then, he took my face.  I've been forced to hide behind a mask ever since.  As you know, the Avatar has recently arrived in Republic City.
Boo!
And if she was here she would tell you that bending brings balance to the world. But she is wrong. The only thing bending has brought to the world is suffering.  It has been the cause of every war in every era.  But that is about to change.  I know you've been wondering, 'what is the revelation?' You are about to get your answer.  Since the beginning of time, the spirits have acted as guardians of our world and they have spoken to me. They say the Avatar has failed humanity.  That is why the spirits have chosen me to usher in a new era of balance. They have granted me a power that will make equality a reality. The power to take a person's bending away, permanently.
That's impossible.  There's no way.
This guy is insane.
Now, for a demonstration.  Please welcome Lightening Bolt Zolt, leader of the Triple Threat Triad, and one of the most notorious criminals in Republic City.
Boo!
Ah, boo yourself!
There's Bolin.
Wait! We can't fight them all. We need to be smart about this.
Then come up with a game plan,  team captain.
Zolt has amassed a fortune by extorting and abusing non-benders. But his reign of terror is about to come to an end.  Now in the interest of fairness I will give Zolt the chance to fight to keep his bending.
You're gonna regret doing that, pal.
What, what did you do to me?
Your Firebending is gone. Forever.
The era of bending is over. A new era of equality has begun.
Any ideas yet?
I think so. See those machines?  They're powered by water and steam. If you can create some cover I can grab Bolin without anyone seeing, then, we duck outta here.
Works for me.  Mako, good luck. 
You too.
No, that's not enough.
Hey you.
Is there a problem, my brother?
What are you doing back here?
Uhh, looking for the bathroom.
Come on...
Thanks. This should be enough.
Uhh, hello, Amon, sir. I think there's been a big misunderstanding.
Bolin! You alright?
Yes!  Mako! I love you!
You benders need to understand there's no place for you in the world anymore.
I wouldn't count us out just yet.  Naga!
Ah. Stop. I want. To be. On. Your back.
The Avatar. That's her!
Let her go.  She's the perfect messenger to tell the city of my power.
Thank goodness. I was just about to send out a search party. Are you alright?
Nun-uh.
Korra. What happened? Did you find your friend?
Yes, but. I was at an Equalist rally. I saw Amon.
What?
He can take people's bending away. For good.
That's...  That's impossible. Only the Avatar has ever possessed that ability.
But I saw him do it.
I believe you. I don't know how Amon has achieved this power. But this means the revolution is more dangerous than ever. No bender is safe.
We have an emergency!
Call whomever you want, but they'll never make it in time. Kuvira's already here,  and she brought her entire army.
Don't get ahead  of yourself.  Securing your hometown won't be like every other city. 
No.  The eyes of the World are on us now.  We must do this right. That's why we need Bolin.
Su trusts him. She'll listen to him.
Are you sure we should be going to Zaofu?  Dad wanted us to bring you back to Republic City.
If Kuvira's heading to Zaofu, so am I. She needs to know that the Avatar is back. The World needs to know.
Whoo-hoo! Avatar fight! This is going to be awesome!
Meelo, there's not gonna be a fight. Kuvira saved my Dad. She was a captain in Su's guard. I-I think she can be reasoned with.
What? No fight?  Why did we go through all that trouble to save you if you're not going to beat someone up? 
Zhu Li,  is this thing on?
Okay, I'm Varrick of Varrick Industries International,  and this is Spirit Vine Experiment 3-02.  Hand me the thing.  In this stasis capsule  is a preserved spirit vine sample weighing approximately two Zhu Lis.  I have postulated  that these spirit vines are a form of pure energy  that's unstable in what we call  "typical earth conditions."  This machine should transfer the energy from the vine into a battery using electrical currents, reverse magnetic polarity, and a little-known phenomenon I call the Varri-Effect. 
It's working.  It's registering five Varricks of power.  Now seven Varricks! 
Whoa.  What is this?  What's going on?
Ahh!  Zhu Li, shut it down.  There are too many Varricks. 
Ahh!
You're too heavy. You know, you could stand to lose a few Zhu Lis.
Of course I saved you.  I can't clean this place up  by myself!  Grab a broom!
What happened?  Were we attacked?
No, we were spirit-vined,  but don't worry.  I'm putting the kibosh on this project. 
No, you're not. Do you realize what we can do with this kind of power?
Yes, I do. And that's why we've got to put an end to it. What if it fell into the wrong hands?
I know.  It's not like me, right? Usually,  I look at a project like this, and all I think is, "Wow, I can make a ton of money off this."  But recently, I've been having these strange feelings  inside. It's like I'm... concerned  with others. And there's this nagging voice  in my head constantly telling me what's right from wrong.  
Well, I'm the other voice in your head, and I'm telling you, you will continue this project.
Sorry, no. I  just really got to stand my ground on this one.  Whoa! 
Now there's a voice in my head  telling me to drop you on the tracks.  Should I listen?
No, no!  Head voices are liars! What do head voices know? I'll work on the project!  Please don't drop me!  Ahh!
Asami, you came.
I'm here to return these.
You never opened them.
Stop writing me. I never want to see or hear from you again. 
Please,  just let me say one thing, then I'll never contact you again.  I can't forgive myself for all the horrible things I've done, and I never expect you to forgive me. I tore our family apart and destroyed our good name. But in a life of regret,  you're the one thing I look back on that makes me smile.  I just want you to know I'm so proud of you, Asami.  You are the greatest thing I ever created. 
Am I in   trouble?
No. In fact, I have good news.  We want you to be part of our inner circle.
Inner circle!  No way! Yes!  Ahem,  that is a great honor. What does it mean, exactly?
It means you've proven your worth.  We're so close to uniting the Empire, but Su has some resentment towards me and Baatar that might cloud her judgment and stop her from making a wise decision.  We believe you can help her see clearly.
I can do that. By the time I'm finished telling her all the great things we've done, she'll be begging to join.
Good, because we're here. 
Aren't all these troops gonna send the wrong message?
The army is here to project strength. You're here to present peace.
Opal,  you're here too!
No!  You've chosen your side.
Sides? There shouldn't be sides. I know, why don't we all  stand in a circle, huh, maybe hold hands? 
I'm not giving up Zaofu. I don't care if you brought your entire army.
Su, I didn't bring my army to threaten you.  I wanted to show you all that your son and I have accomplished.
You must realize what you're doing goes against everything your father and I tried to teach you.
Don't say that.  Can't you see she's brainwashed you.
Ha! I didn't brainwash him, I set him free. And now he's accomplished more with me  than he ever could have with you.
Okay, guys, obviously, there's a lot of personal, painful history here. So what do say we just all forget about that stuff, huh? I mean, that's the past.  Right, Wing? Right, Wei? You guys know  what I'm talking about.  High five. 
All right.  No, it's cool.  You know what I think we need to do? Focus on the future. And the future is bright. Let me tell you. I've seen it. Yeah, saw it last month.  We went to this town that had nothing. Most of the people there had never even seen a Satomobile before. But now they have  two Satomobiles,  running water,  and a magnet train that goes right through their town. I mean, how awesome is that?
They might have been happy when you first arrived,  but I've seen what happens after you leave. Citizens are forced to work as slave labor.  Dissenters are sent off to who knows where.
You're wrong, Opal. Now, I don't know what you think you've seen, but  I'm giving you the 100% Bolin Guarantee that we're making the Earth Empire a better place to live.
I can't believe you brought Bolin here  to try to sway us.  Leave. Zaofu will never accept you as their leader.
Then you leave me no choice.  You have twenty-four hours to agree to join the Empire,  or we take the city by force.
I see it. Zaofu.  We made it!  And a bunch of other people are here too.
Oh, no.  I hope we're not too late.
Korra?  I can't believe it.  Where have you been? You disappeared.  Everyone was so worried.
I'll tell you the whole story later.  Right now, I want to help you stop Kuvira. What can I do?
You were just bluffing, right?  I mean, you're not really going to attack Zaofu... Are you?
When people don't cooperate, we must find other ways of convincing them to join.
Other ways?  How many times have we used these other ways in the past?
It's not for you to worry about.
So... what does happen to all of those towns and villages after we leave?  I just realized I've never really gone back and checked on them.
Those people are my loyal subjects,  and they contribute to the Empire however I see fit.  Now that you're in the inner circle, you're going to have to accept some hard truths.
Maybe I'm not really an inner-circle kind of guy.  Or- or maybe we don't take over Zaofu. We could just let them be on their own.  Then yay, the Empire's united. Congratulations to us. 
I didn't know your personal feelings for Opal  were stronger than your loyalty to me.  Zaofu will join us.  The only thing I'm second-guessing is the decision to bring you along. Maybe you need to spend some time in a re-education camp.
I thought that's where we send people to learn new trade skills...
Your loyalty seems to be wavering.
No, no, I'm totally on your side, completely one hundred percent loyal. 
How did things get so bad between you and Kuvira? I thought she was your protÈgÈ?
She was more than that. She was like a daughter to me. I took her in when she was eight years old and nourished her talents.  Kuvira was smart, a natural leader, and quickly rose through the ranks.  I saw myself in her.
What happened? 
Three years ago, after the fall of the Earth Queen,  Raiko and Tenzin came to see me.
The Earth Kingdom is in chaos.  There's a vacuum of power, and I'm concerned about what will happen if someone doesn't take control of the situation. 
And do you think I should be the one? 
You're the perfect person to take charge. The World leaders trust you, and as a Bei Fong, you have credibility in the Earth Kingdom.
I'm honored that you thought of me,  but I'm not interested in imposing my ideals on an entire nation.  I'm afraid I can't help you.
Suyin, I know this isn't my place,  but I think you should do this. Zaofu has always been a beacon of modern progress, and now you can share that with everyone.
What would you have me do,  march into Ba Sing Se with an army? We'd be seen as conquerors and greeted with nothing but war.
There are already wars. The Earth Queen nearly destroyed our nation. This is our opportunity to change things.
It's not going to happen.
I didn't realize at the time, but that moment created a rift between us.  Kuvira turned my own son against me.  And together they plotted behind my back. 
What do you think you're doing?
We're doing what you don't have the guts to do. We're going to Ba Sing Se to help bring order back to the Earth Kingdom.
No! You will stay here.
And who's going to stop me? Your security force was more than happy to join my cause. They're some of the best fighters in the World,  and they are tired of being treated like exotic birds in your cage.
If you leave now, you will never be welcomed back.
When I choose to return, it will be on my own terms.
Kuvira and Baatar left that day  with Varrick,  my security force, and a few of Zaofu's wealthiest citizens.  After Kuvira proved herself by stabilizing Ba Sing Se,  Raiko and the other World leaders made her the provisional head of the Earth Kingdom. Once she refused to step down,  I knew it was only a matter of time  until she made her way back here.
I want to fix this. 
You can.  Go into the Avatar State and demolish her army. Remove Kuvira from power once and for all.
Fighting is something the old me would do, but that always made things worse. Let me talk with Kuvira. Maybe I can reason with her.
Kuvira doesn't listen to reason!
I can't believe Kuvira locked me in here like a prisoner.  I'm not feeling well,  I think I'm running out of air.  Zhu Li, hold your breath.
Great! Now we're both gonna die. 
Varrick. Varrick.
Augh, and the head voices are back. 
Bolin, thank goodness you're here.  Where did that hatch come from?  Forget the hatch.  There's something important I've got to tell ya.
Well, there's something important I've got tell you too. 
How'd you find out?
When I refused to build her a super weapon, she threatened my life.
She threatened me too, and she's threatening Zaofu. And it turns out she's been threatening villages this whole time.  We've got  to get out of here.
I couldn't agree more, kid.
Korra, it's such an honor to see you again.  The last I heard, you were still healing in the South Pole. 
Well, I'm feeling much better now.
That's wonderful news.
I'm here to ask you to back down.  Please,  take your army and leave.
I think we both know that's not going to happen.
I can't let you take Zaofu.
Look, I was tasked with bringing stability to the Earth Kingdom. Zaofu is the last holdout.  Why should I treat it differently than any other state?
What you're doing isn't right.
I understand you're just trying to do Su a favor, but you can't come to me as I'm on the verge of reuniting my nation and tell me to stop.  The World was descending into chaos while you  were gone.  In order to fix it, I had to make some tough decisions.
I know what that's like.  I've had plenty of people mad at me about decisions I've made.
Exactly.  Korra, if you really want to help,  go back to Su and try to talk some sense into her.  Let's call a temporary truce. I won't make any moves until you talk to her and get back to me.
Maybe that will be for the best.
He came by to see Varrick, but we turned him away.
Okay,  I say we go up and around the mountains  and  sneak into Zaofu from the rear.
We're not going to Zaofu. that place is doomed. We've got to head to Republic City.
What? No. No, no, no. We've got to help here.
We'll be helping by warning the World about Kuvira's potential super weapon.
Well, that is helping,  but it's a completely different type of helping.  Hmm, let me think about this.  Ahh!
That's not the flamethrower.  What idiot designed these things?
Less lecturing, more saving my life! 
Ugh!
Ahh!  Oof!
Hey, I think I figured it out.
Argh!  Yah! 
Thanks a lot, Zhu Li.
You came back.
When I first came here, it was because I wanted to tell you face-to-face that I never wanted to see or hear from you again.  I wanted my words to hurt you, so that you would know how you hurt me.
I'm sorry.
But when I saw you, it wasn't anger I felt. It was sadness.  You tainted our past and destroyed our future together.
I want to make amends.
I'm not sure I'll ever be able to forgive you,  but that doesn't mean I shouldn't try.  I thought we could play some Pai Sho,  like we used to.
Nothing would make me happier.
Don't torture us.
Send these three away on the next train.  Bolin and Zhu Li will be going to the re-education camp  for our most severe dissenters.  And you will continue work on the spirit energy project under close, armed supervision.  I want it weaponized immediately.
Why would I?
Hey, come on. I'm right here.
You two could learn something from her. Rise, Zhu Li. I'll give you another chance.
Think about what you're doing. We're partners. We have history.
No,  not the thing!  Zhu Li! 
Where's Su?  I have to talk to her.
No.
Tenzin, are you sure you can't go with them?
Meelo! 
Raiko asked me to stay here and help figure out a diplomatic solution to this Kuvira problem.
Mom, we'll be fine.  Grandpa Aang and his friends were around our age when they traveled the World.
Well, at least I won't have to worry about you  starving out there.
Mom, we're going to be in the wild,  living off the land. We don't need your food. 
But I made your favorite treat. 
Sweet buns with happy faces on them?  Well,  I guess we're not officially on the road yet.
Aw, this one is smudged.  I can't eat this.
You know, sometimes,  things get smudged in the wild.
Were you able  to get a read on Korra yet?
No, but once we're further out, I'll be able to hone in on her spiritual energy.  We should be able to find her within a few days. 
Good luck, and be careful. Remember, Jinora's in charge.
I answer to no man  or girl, even if she does  have tattoos.
Meelo...
Now, let's move out, soldiers.
Pepper,  yip yip.
Finally!  I've been holding my pee for an hour.
If you get through to Korra, tell her I said hi.
Do you feel anything yet?
What's taking so long?
Ikki, I can't concentrate if you keep talking.  Why don't you go play with one of those spirits?
Jinora's spirity powers are broken, and she doesn't know where Korra is.
My powers are not broken. I just need more than two seconds  and some quiet.
While you try to pull yourself together, Poki and I are going to go into town and find out if anyone's seen Korra.
Sounds like a good plan to me.
Enough chit chat.  You can hold the picture  of Korra I drew.
Wow!  I didn't know you could draw. 
You don't know a lot of things about me, sister. Let's roll. 
Have you seen  this woman?
I'm not adorable. I'm dangerous.
Aww...
This never happened. Let's split.
Man!
Can I trust you? 
I guess so.
I'm on a top secret mission to find the Avatar.  Have you seen her?
I haven't, sorry. Top secret mission, huh?
Yeah, it's been pretty dangerous.  I've seen  some things.
Really?  What kind of things?
Crazy things.
Cool.
I'm Meelo. What should I call you,  other than, beautiful?
I'm Tuyen. Nice to meet you.
Ooh!  Meelo found a girlfriend.
Go away, Ikki!
Jinora's been looking for you. We're moving on.
Looks like you got to get back to your mission.  Good luck, Meelo.
Thanks a lot, Ikki. You drove away the love of my life!
Jinora,  Ikki!  It's Korra!
Where, where, where,  where, where, where, where?
It's just a photo of Korra.
At least it's something.
Pretty neat,  huh?  She came by here about a...  six months ago.
Looks like someone just drummed up  a good old-fashioned lead.  Then where did she go?
Oh, I don't know,  but she wasn't looking too good. 
Ikki, this is all your fault.
What? I didn't do anything.
Exactly, you  need to start pulling your weight.  That goes for you too, so-called leader. 
Remember when he used to be so nice and sweet?
No.
So... What's the plan for today?
You're looking at it.
But we didn't do anything yesterday or the day before that. 
I know!  Tell me the story about how you taught Aang to earthbend.
What's there to tell? I threw some rocks at the Avatar, he got all whiny, and Sokka fell in a hole.
I thought there'd be more to it than that. What about the time you guys took down the Fire Lord? That must have been epic!
Oh, yeah.  It was hot, I was on a blimp, and I think a giant turtle showed up. Wow, what a day.
Okay, you're terrible at telling stories.
You're terrible at listening to them.
Quit making all that racket.  If you're so antsy to do something, why don't you go and collect some mushrooms for dinner?
You got it.
Take the path  till you see the boulder with a hole in it. Then go to your left. Oh, and make sure you get the big, slimy ones.  They're the tastiest!
Hey,  where's all the food Mom gave us?
I threw it in the river.
You did what?! That food was supposed to last us two weeks!
Hey, keep it down! I'm trying to meditate.
Yeah,  keep it down, Ikki.
Meelo threw away all our food!
From now on,  we hunt for our meals.
Meelo, we're vegetarians. We don't hunt.
Enough whining.  Poki and I will go find some grub.
My name's Meelo. I like to throw away food and fart at inappropriate moments.  I'm Jinora.  I'm so above it all because  I'm meditating all the time.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't see you there.
Wait!  You dropped your breakfast!
Hey.  Does this mean we're friends?
No. I swear I'm not a spy.  I've been traveling with my brother and sister.  It's our first big mission, and my Dad, Tenzin, is counting on us.  But if we don't find the Avatar, he's going to be really disappointed. 
Why do you want to know?
Where did you get those?
My Mom wrote those notes.  That's our sack of food!
Who cares? I don't want to see them.  I'd rather hang out here with you guys. Hit me with one of those macaroons. 
Are you okay?
Yup,  totally fine.  I hope you're hungry,  'cause we found some-  We found some berries. 
Ugh.  Looks like you got some bad berries.  So much for living off the land. 
They're fine. I just ate too many of them because  they're so- so delicious. 
Did you run into Ikki while you were picking your poisonous berries?
Uh, no. What, did she run off or something?
I think so.
Great, now I got to go find the Avatar and her. This mission is getting worse by the day. 
This isn't only your mission, Meelo. I thought we were doing this as a family.
It seems pretty lonely out here. Where is everybody else? 
It's tough to be left out, huh? I know exactly what you're going through. 
Yeah. My brother and sister are always leaving me out of fun stuff. I mean, we're supposed to be looking for the Avatar together, but they won't even let me help.
We've been traveling down the West coast, and the only lead we have is some guy Who said he saw her six months ago.
What about this place?
You're welcome, Ikki.
Why did you do that?
We're saving you!  Let's go.
I had everything under control.  I just found our food, and I have an idea where Korra is.
You do? Then let's get going!
Hold on.
Sorry my brother and sister knocked you out.  Nice chatting with you. 
There you are.  You got my dinner yet?
No, this swamp,  it did crazy things to my mind. I had visions of all the times my enemies hurt me.
Yeah, I figured something like that might happen.
What?!  You wanted me to see those visions? You are one twisted old lady,  you know that?
Look, I know you want to get better, and so does The Swamp.  It can sense you're out of balance.  It'll teach you what you need to learn,  if you're open to listening.
Okay, Swamp. I'm all ears.
You said you saw your past enemies. Now, why do you think that is?
I don't know, because they've made me and a lot of other people suffer.
Sounds like you're carrying around your former enemies,  the same way you're still carrying around that metal poison. You ever consider maybe you could learn something from them?
Sounds like The Swamp's messing with your mind too.
My mind is just fine, thank you.  Listen,  what did Amon want?  Equality for all. Unalaq?  He brought back the spirits.  And Zaheer believed in freedom. 
I guess.
The problem was, those guys were totally out of balance, and they took their ideologies too far.
Okay, fine. But that doesn't explain why they keep haunting me.
Because you need to face your fears.  You can't expect to deal with future enemies if you're still fighting the old ones. 
Maybe you're right,  but how am I supposed to move on?
Boy, you Avatars  sure need a lot of hand-holding.  Get up.  We're going to the Banyan Grove Tree.
Those soldiers said there weren't any troops here, and I figure if Korra's not feeling good,  she might come to a spiritual place like this to get better.
There is an enormous amount of spiritual activity here,  but I don't feel Korra.
Well, that's what we get for listening to  Ikki.
Guys, we just got here. Let's at least look around.
I'm sorry, Ikki, but I'm with Meelo on this. I don't think we're going to find her here.  Let's go, Pepper.
Why did those stupid vines pull us in here anyway?
Because  they want us here.  I'm telling you, Korra's got to be close.
I don't know, Ikki. I still don't sense Korra.
Well, you  haven't sensed her the entire time we've  been looking for her.
Next time I go on a mission, it's going to be boys only, just Poki and  me. 
It's beautiful.
The roots of the Banyan Grove Tree spread out for miles in every direction, connecting this whole swamp.  Your problem is you've been disconnected for too long, disconnected from the people who love you and disconnected from yourself.
I'm tired of listening to you!
Korra.  I know where Korra is!
I can't believe it!  I saw Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo. They're here!
Good. Hopefully, they're here to take you home.
Oh,  we missed you so much, Korra.
I missed you so much too. How did you find me  all the way out here?
Jinora sensed your energy.
But we never would've been here if it weren't for Ikki.
I never would've  stormed off and found those soldiers if it weren't for Meelo.
I was trying to toughen up these ladies, but I guess it was a team effort.
I love your hair.
It's so you.
I'm so sorry.  This is Meelo,  Jinora,  and Ikki,  Aang and Katara's grandchildren.
Your grandpa was a real pain in my butt.
Wait a minute,  cranky,  old,  blind...  You must be Toph! 
Oh,  I like this one.
You need to come home, Korra. Kuvira is taking over the Earth Kingdom.
You have to stop her.
I don't know. I'm not the Avatar I used to be. I can't even go into the Avatar State.
Please, Korra.
The World needs you back.
All right, I'm ready.
I'm not bending it  out of you.  You got to do this on your own.
Close your eyes.  Clear your mind.  And don't freak out like last time.  Now,  focus your energy.  Find the metal.  Let it move through your body.
That fight is over.  Release the fear.
Well done, Korra.
The Avatar  is back in business!
I feel so much lighter.  Thank you so much for helping me.  I'd like to give you a hug now if that's okay with you.
All right.  You earned it.
Bye, Toph! 
Bye, see you later.
It was so nice to meet you! 
We're gonna miss you! 
Finally,  some peace and quiet.
So then the crowds are gathered,  all excited to see my coronation,  when all of a sudden, these boulders come rolling through.  And guess what pops out of 'em? Earthbender dames! These gals start banging the boulders like drums and sing the song of my royal lineage. It's the most dynamite six-hour show you've ever seen in your life.
Shouldn't you be getting ready to... I don't know- rule the whole nation?
Now, now, now. Don't get yourself  in a tizzy.  I'll have ministers for all that.  No sir, Mako.  when we get to Ba Sing Se, it'll just be  two kooky pals livin' the life! 
Yay...
Getting excited for your big day? 
Does a  platypus-bear poop in- Hey!  You can't put bleachers there!  There won't be enough room for the dance of the badgermoles!  Look, it's gonna go like this. 
You sure that's the guy you want running the Earth Kingdom?
Trust me.  We'll be sending a delegation of experienced advisors  to handle day-to-day governing. 
I see the Prince is  becoming accustomed to the burdens of leadership.
You know royals. They love a ceremony. Have you received any word  on the Avatar's location?
Not yet, but I have airbenders all over the World on the lookout for her.  I hope they find her soon.  I'm concerned about reports I've heard regarding Kuvira's growing military. They say she's throwing some of her dissenters into prison camps.
Well, she'll be stepping down tomorrow.  We can worry about correcting any of her mistakes after that.
And  you're not worried about her handing power over to Prince Wu?
When Kuvira started cleaning up the Earth Kingdom,  she knew her position wasn't permanent.  She gave me her word that she'd step down.
Still, I'd feel a lot better if Korra were here.
You've gotta help me get back into Avatar fighting shape.  I'm getting my butt kicked by  losers all over the Earth Kingdom. The World needs me.
Get over  yourself.  The World doesn't need you one bit.
But while  I've been the Avatar,  I've stopped some really bad people from doing some really bad things.
Listen,  when I was Chief of Police of Republic City,  I worked my butt off busting criminals.  But did that  make crime disappear? Nope.  If there's one thing I learned on the beat, it's that the names change, but the street stays the same.
So, basically, you're saying that everything I've ever accomplished has been pointless. And I thought Bei Fong was grumpy.
I'm the original Bei Fong. 
So, you're not gonna train me?
Well, I was planning on  soaking my feet  in mud for a few weeks.  But I can't stand you being so pathetic and getting your butt kicked all the time.  All right. I guess I can help.
Thank you! 
Nah-ah-ah-ah.  You want to hug something,  go hug a tree.  We're here to work.
Hello, Republic City!  Bolin is back!
And Eska's also here.
I see you have replaced me  with a new girlfriend.  Well done. She seems very threatening.
Oh,  no, no. That's Kuvira. She's kind of my boss.
Boss. Girlfriend. Same thing.
It's no mistake. Desna sleeps in the tub. 
Never thought I'd be  allowed back in the Republic City Four Elements.  Raiko must have turned purple  when Kuvira made him pardon me of my alleged crimes.
Upstanding is right! And don't forget to fill the extra bag with as many of those little soaps as you can grab.  Love the lavender scent.
Bolin!
Look at you!  My little brother got all... important. 
I know, right? I see myself in the mirror sometimes, and I think I'm in trouble before I realize, it's only me.
So...  what's it like  working for Kuvira? From what I've heard, she's pretty harsh.
No! I-I mean, she can be tough, sure, but we're turning around the Earth Kingdom like you wouldn't believe. You remember how bad grandma's neighborhood in Ba Sing Se was?  All that's completely changed. I mean, we are really... helping people. But what have you been up to? Fighting crime?  Busting triads? Chasing the ladies,  Mako style? 
Well, I've been  working for Wu.
And, uh...  yeah.
So have you seen Korra yet?
No. She was supposed to come in with Tonraq, but he says she left the South Pole months ago.  No one knows where she is. 
Hello, Baatar Junior.
I don't if I'd call marching all over the Earth Kingdom, forcing people to bow to Kuvira, "doing good."
I'm just glad that she'll be stepping down after tomorrow.
I hope  I'm not out of order saying this...  you're pretty easy on the eyes for a military type.  I'll put in a good word for you with the hotel staff, maybe get you a little upgrade.  I've been living here for years. They love me.
I won't be needing your help. We've reserved the Presidential Suite.
Well, I think someone is pulling your chain, gumdrop. See, I'm in the Presidential Ssuite.
Not anymore.  I had you moved out.
Wait, what?  Cam, where's all my stuff?
Junior Suite?
Something you should know about me... I always get what I want. 
Your Royal  Cabinet is here, Your Majesty!
Where have you been?  My coronation is in ten minutes.  Where's everyone else?  Where are the seven sacred chests of exquisite finery? Where are my grandfather's taffeta pantaloons?
Sadly, most of your servants were scattered and the royal things were looted after the Queen was...  removed from office. So your coronation may not have some of the usual items... like... the crown.
There's no crown?  How can you have a coronation without a crown? How will people know when I'm officially the King?
We still  have one of the royal jewels we can pin on you.
An earring?
Think of it more as a royal brooch. 
Are you telling me that there are no dancing badgermoles?  No acrobat bell-ringers?  No horn-blowing announcer-y guy? 
It will be a very simple, intimate, elegant ceremony. A wonderful day for your Kingdom. Just try on the brooch,  Your Grace. You'll see it will  look beau- 
Don't... touch me.
Okay. Bring it!
Tell me what you did wrong.
Well... I was thinking  that you were gonna- 
Exactly!  You were thinking.  Go again. 
Pathetic.  Of all the Avatars I've worked with,  you're by far the worst.  I know there's  only one other Avatar,  but still.
Ah!  Hey! It seems like you're enjoying having someone around to beat up an awful lot.
Yeah, the swampbenders out here  really can't take a punch.
So... what made you want to drop out and disconnect from the rest of the World?
I'm more connected to the World than you've ever been.  The roots and vines, they run all over the World. I can see Su and Lin, Zaofu and Republic City...  I see everything.
You're blind compared to me.
Now rise, Wu of the Hou-Ting Dynasty,  King of all the Earth Lands,  and glorious defender  of Ba Sing Se.  Long may you reign. 
Thank you  for that incredibly brief but very moving ceremony. I am touched by the love of my devoted countrymen  who have worked so hard to restore their beloved leader to the throne.  One of them deserves special attention.  Kuvira? Rise.
For your service to the realm,  I would like to present you with the Kyoshi  Medal of Freedom,  our nation's highest honor, which was somehow not stolen,  unlike the royal pinkie rings. Hmph.
Thank you. And if you don't mind,  I'd like to say a few words.
Why not? We've got six hours to fill.
Growing up in Zaofu with Suyin Bei Fong, I learned  that the idea of a royal family passing a title from one generation to the next was archaic,  and that technology and innovation should be what drives a nation forward.  It was the pathetic rule of Kings and Queens that caused the Earth Kingdom to descend into such incredible disarray.  It's taken me three years to get it back on track, and there's no way I will allow it  to slip back into the dark ages.  I'd like to make an announcement to the World. The Earth Kingdom is no more.  And from here on out,  this man has no authority. 
Wait, what?  But I just got the royal brooch.
I have created a new Earth Empire, and I will continue to lead it into the future myself, bringing about a new era of prosperity for my people.
And let me assure my fellow leaders of one thing...  anyone  who crosses our borders or stands in our way will be crushed.
Worst coronation ever. 
Relax, kid, what can they do? Kuvira controls the whole nation now, 
Now that's  a nice-looking hunk of spirit vine.  Let's take it back to the lab and get it stabilized immediately.
You look worried, Bolin. 
You believe in the work that we've done for the people of the Earth Empire, right, Bolin?
Then stick with me. I'm going to need your help now more than ever.  Raiko and the other leaders want to bully us into accepting some idiot King  who will serve them but neglect the people.  We have to stand strong against them.
That was just some tough rhetoric to let people know that we mean business.  Believe me, conflict is the last thing  I want.  Will you help me make history, Bolin?
Thank you.
Can you give us the room, please?
I met with the World leaders, and I've come as their representative.
So now you're taking an interest in World Affairs?  A little late, isn't it? When the Queen fell and everyone was asking you to help keep the Earth Kingdom from falling apart, all you wanted to do was hide in Zaofu and let others deal with the consequences.
That's hardly fair. I didn't want to seize power for myself,  which is what you've done. I'm telling you, for the good of everyone, you have to step down.
I stepped up.  I provide stability and equality. Tell your World leaders to stay out of Earth Empire business. We won't accept their hand-picked dictator.
What makes you so different? You're just another tyrant. And don't pretend the people put you where you are. I know what happens to cities who don't want to hand over control to you.
Then you know what's coming for Zaofu. 
First I lose my suite,  then I lose my throne.  My royal brooch is a lie!  I know you must be crushed,  not getting to come back to Ba Sing Se with me.
Don't worry about me.  I'll find a way to make it.
Good ol' Mako, my big tough guy. Ugh.  Okay, I just have to go on, move forward,  take decisive action  Let's go shopping!
Ugh.  Get rid of him.  He's with her.
He's my brother. 
You aren't going to keep working for Kuvira now that she's going against the wishes of the entire World, are you?
I don't know, bro.
By crushing  anyone who gets in your way?
It seems like she's just a dictator 
Well, no, but still-
I'm sorry.  I don't want to work for your glorious emperor in her military dictatorship.
Sorry, sport. I heard it all.
Can't believe him!
I know!  Insulting another man's suite? It's beneath low. But I think I know what would cheer you up...  a visit to little Ba Sing Se Fashion Mall! I'll buy you a smoothie.
Yeah. Okay.
That was terrible.
Ha! Maybe for you.  I had a great time! I never realized  how much I missed tormenting the Avatar.  I wish you were putting up more of a fight.  But it was still fun. 
You were tossing me around like a rag doll all day long.
I know! And I'm an old lady. Imagine me  in my prime. Ha-ha!  I would have  destroyed you!
I just don't understand why  I can't get back to my former self. It's like... I'm a step slower.  I'm tentative. I'm out of sync.  I just can't get back in the groove.
Probably carrying around that metal doesn't help.
What metal?
The little bits of metal poison stuck in your body.  Are you trying to tell me you can't feel metal in your own body?  You really are the worst Avatar ever.
I thought Su got it all out.
No, my girls never really picked up metalbending all that well, if you ask me.
That's been  my problem this entire time!  I gotta get it out.  You can get it out for me, right?
Who do you think you're talking to? 
Once we're done with these, we can go into the Middle Ring and I'll let you pick out some new suits.  Then we'll hit the boutiques in the Upper Ring for me.
Where did you  get those shirts?
You can't sell that  junk in here!  This is the little Ba Sing Se fashion mall,  and I'm the little King  here! Respect the brooch!
I am the glorious defender!
We need to get you out of here.
Ooh!  It's destiny!  Look where we are, Mako... the royal palace. 
The throne!  Out of my way!
Hey!  It's my birthday!
It's my coronation day!  You'll have another birthday next year,  but I'll never have this day  back again!  Never! 
Okay, you're losing it.
This is the worst day of my life! 
Why? Do you really want to be the King?  I mean, Kuvira might be a power-crazed dictator,  but at least she spent the last few years working hard to make the Earth Kingdom somewhat better. If you were an Earth Kingdom citizen,  do you think you're the kind of person you want as your King?   What have you ever done for your people?  I'm sorry.  That was out of line.
No. You're right.  No one ever talked to me like that before. I guess I'm just a joke who got what he deserved. 
Let's get you out  of here and back to some place safe.
Carry me?
No.
Okay. If you want me to bend out this metal, you need to relax.
I am relaxed.
Ha! Seriously?  Your body is like a twisted tree trunk.
Just do it! I'm ready! 
It wouldn't hurt if you would just relax! Stop fighting me!
I'm not fighting! 
All right, that's it.  You're going to have to do this yourself.  Clearly, you want to keep the metal in there.
What do you mean?  Why would I want poison inside me?
I don't know.  Maybe so you have an excuse not to go back to being the Avatar.  If you don't get better, you can't do your job, so you don't have to worry about getting hurt again.
What? That's ridiculous.
Whatever.  When you want it out,  you can bend it out.  I can't deal with all your issues for you.
Wait!  What am I supposed to do now?
How should I know? Ask the spirit that brought you here.  The good news is, if you're looking for a place to hang where no one will bother you,  you picked the best swamp in the World!
This is a mission of the utmost importance  Conflict is coming to the Earth Kingdom, and we need to find the Avatar.  Can I count on you three  to bring Korra home?
You can count on one of us.  I don't know about these two ladies. 
From now on, developing this technology is your number one priority.
This is going to change everything.
Hurry up in there!  Come on,  I got an emergency situation!
Knock yourself out.
Huh?
You again.
Leave me alone!
What's wrong with her?
Young lady,  are you all right?  Can I take you to a doctor? 
No, I don't need any help.
Now don't take this the wrong way,  but I can't wait for you to leave.
How else is she supposed to take that but the wrong way?
I mean because I've never had a pen pal before. I'm going to write you so many letters,  and just to get the ball rolling,  here. Spoiler alert.  Pabu and I already miss you. 
Thanks, that's sweet. 
Are you  sure you don't want some company in the Southern Water Tribe? I'm happy to come with you. 
No, I appreciate it, but I'll only be gone a couple weeks.  A little time alone will be good for me.
Now,  I don't want you to worry about a thing while you're gone. Your recovery should be your number one concern.  Jinora, the airbenders, and I have everything under control.
Bye, Korra! 
Get better soon!
Don't forget to write!
Ah!
Can't sleep again?  Honey,  your father and I have tried to give you as much space as you've needed, but we're worried. You're not sleeping, you're barely eating. We don't want to push you,  but it's been three weeks. Will you please go see Katara?
All right.  I'll go.
You're going to get through this.  Oh, I love you so much.
The poison did a lot of internal damage.
Can you fix it?
I can help guide your healing process,  but whether you get better or not is up to you.  I know what it's like  to go through a traumatic experience, and I promise you, if you dedicate yourself to getting better,  you'll recover stronger than ever.
That's what I want,  more than anything.
Then try something for me.  Concentrate  on your big toe.  Visualize it moving.  Breathe. 
Did you see that?  It worked!
The mind can be a powerful ally  or your greatest enemy.  Now, I want you to try taking  a step.
Ah!  Ugh!
You're okay.  Your body thinks it's still in danger, but you're safe here.  Use your mind to overcome the pain.  Try again. 
I'm done for today.
"Dear Korra, I miss you. It's not the same in Republic City without you. How are you feeling?  Things are going well here. I just got a big contract to help redesign the city's infrastructure, so I'll be keeping pretty busy for awhile."
"Hey, Korra. So, I'm not very good at writing letters. It's 2:15 in the afternoon. Weather is fair. Chance of snow showers later today. But enough joking around.  I hope you're doing well. Me? I'm back on the beat. Bei Fong has me staking out the Red Monsoon hideout, you won't believe what's going down."
"My dearest, Avatar Korra. Though several fortnights have passed since your departure, to convalesce in the homeland of your tribesmen,  I feel our friendship knows neither time nor distance.  You will be most pleased  to learn that I found gainful employment with Sir Varrick  and the Lady Kuvira. I set off on the morrow with some trepidation,  but I am eager to offer any aid I can in stabilizing the Earth Kingdom!"
Whenever you're ready. 
What's the point?  We've been at this for almost six months and  I can barely take a couple of steps without collapsing.
I know you're frustrated, but-
Of course I'm frustrated! A crazy man poisoned me,  and now I can't dress myself or cook for myself or do anything for myself,  and this whole time my friends have been off helping the World while I'm stuck with you, and you can't even heal me! 
That came out wrong. 
It's all right.  Let your anger and frustration flow like water.
I am trying to understand why this happened to me.  But nothing makes any sense.  I'm tired, Katara. I'm so tired.
Korra, I know you feel alone right now, but you're not the first Avatar who's had to overcome great suffering.  Can you imagine how much pain Aang felt when he learned that his entire culture was taken from him?
That must have been so awful.
But he never let it destroy his spirit.  He chose to find meaning in his suffering,  and eventually found peace.
And what am I gonna find if I get through this?
I don't know,  but won't it be interesting to find out? 
Close your eyes. Visualize yourself walking over to Naga.
Can you see it? 
Yes. 
Now,  take that first step.
Where'd you  come from, little cutie?
You can see her, too?
If you can see her, too,  maybe I'm not going crazy.
How'd you do that?
You want me to follow you?
All right, let's see what I find.
It's so good to see you! 
How have you been, Korra? You look great.
I feel great.  Come on.  I want to show you how much better I'm doing. 
Attack!  I can take it.
All right, the sparring match is over.
I thought I was ready.
There is no shame in taking the time you need to make a full recovery. Being the Avatar can wait.
But what about the Earth Kingdom?  I hear it's still a mess out there.
The situation has been stabilizing since Kuvira took charge.
But that should be me out there fixing things,  not her.
I know you want to help, but trust me, everyone has this under control. I just think you need to... 
If you say, "be patient,"  I swear I'm gonna water-smack you in the mouth.
No, I was going to say you need to...  not worry about the future.  Be grateful for where you are now and the progress you've made.
"Dear Asami, I'm sorry I haven't written  to you sooner, but every time I've tried,  I never knew what to say.  The past two years have been the hardest of my life. Even though I can get around fine now, I still can't go into the Avatar State.  I keep having visions of Zaheer and what happened that day. Katara thinks a lot of this is in my head,  so I've been meditating a lot, but sometimes I worry I'll never fully recover.  Please don't tell Mako and Bolin I wrote to you and not them. I don't want to hurt their feelings, but it's easier to tell you about this stuff.  I don't think they'd understand."
Everything all right, sweetie?
There's something I need to tell you both.
What is it?
I want to go back to Republic City.
Are you sure? 
I know I'm not one hundred percent yet, but I feel like I've hit a wall. I need to be where the action is,  where my friends are.
I'll have the White Lotus prepare a boat  and they can take you back to Republic City as soon as you're ready. 
No, I want to go alone.  And have some time to clear my head. It will be good for me.
Two  lobster crabs, please.
Why,  you're the Avatar, ain't ya?
Yep, that's me.
I can't  believe it!  Mind if I take a picture  for my wall of Avatars?
I'm kind of in a hurry.
It'll only take a second.  Avatar Aang  was a big fan of my seaweed wraps,  you know,  so I named them  "Aang Rolls."  Now they're my biggest seller!  And they ain't even got fish in 'em. 
Now smile.
But if could have met any Avatar,  I'd have to pick Kyoshi.  Taking down a shark squid with  one hand?  Now that's a lady I'd like to get to know.
Thieves!  Get back here!
Oh, don't worry.  The Avatar's  right here.  Well, what are you waiting for?  Go get 'em!
Hand over the bags or else.
You sure she's the Avatar?
Do you mind?  I'm trying to concentrate here.  And, yes, I am the Avatar. I'm just wearing different clothes and I cut my hair.
I was hurt pretty bad awhile ago, and lost touch with my Avatar Spirit.
I came to the Tree of Time hoping to reconnect with Raava and turn on the Avatar State again. But it's not working.  The last time I was here I saw all sorts of visions. Now I don't see anything.
I'm sorry,  but for years people have been saying  they can help me get better.  Nothing's worked.  I need to figure this out on my own.
"Dear Mom and Dad,  I arrived in Republic City a couple weeks ago and  couldn't be happier.  It's nice to be back at the temple, and it's great to see my friends again.  Don't worry, I'm taking it easy,  but hopefully I'll be back  in action soon.  I miss you both very much. Please give Naga  a big hug for me. Love, Korra."
Raava?  Raava!
I am ending this.
Excuse me,  who do I talk to about getting in the ring?
Is that all you got?
We have a winner!
Hurry up in there!
Why did you bring me to The Swamp?
Wait, I met you at the Tree of Time.  You should have told me who you were.
I get your point.  But why did you bring me here? What am I gonna find in The Swamp?
No, wait!  Come back!
You're just in my mind.  You're not real.
Help!
Feeling better?
Where am I? What happened?
I was hoping you could tell me.  I found you passed out in the mud.
How did you know I was out there?
I'm pretty tapped into the goings-on around here.  What brings you to The Swamp, anyway?
A spirit led me here and told me I was supposed to find someone. Is that you? 
Beats me. But if your Avatar senses called you here,  you should probably listen  to them.
Wait, you recognize me? 
In a manner of speaking.  We were good friends in your previous life.
I can't believe it. Toph? 
Nice to see you again, Twinkle Toes. 
I can't believe it. The Upper Ring is in chaos.
Don't try to stop us. We're taking back what's ours.
Should we do something? 
This isn't our battle.  We have to deliver Zaheer's message to Korra immediately.
Right. Okay. Find Korra, deliver message.  Yeah, this should be easy. We just gotta get out of the city and get to the desert, then somehow find her in the vast, expansive wasteland  that goes on for thousands and thousands of miles.  This isn't gonna be easy.
We need an airship.
Ooh!
Excuse me,  may I have your attention please? I'm with the Republic City Police, and I need to commandeer this airship to help the Avatar.
Let me give it a shot. Hey, the Queen's gold  is on the third floor of the palace!  Second door on the right! 
You just gotta know how to talk to them, bro.
They took everything.  I mean, who rips out a transmission radio?
Some folks just do not  have respect For other people's property.  Now let's steal this airship! 
You know how to fly this thing?
Technically speaking? No. But, come on, how hard can it be? 
Up! Up!
I don't see any "up" button. I see levers and switches. Oh,  there it is.
The whole city is falling to pieces.
Mako, our family's down there.
Move over. 
Ahh!
We're getting them out.
Oh, you think  just because you dated Asami, you know how to fly this better than me?
Yeah.
Bolin?  What are  you doing here?
I came to get you guys out. This whole block is about to go up in flames.  Come on, Mako and I have an airship on the roof. 
We can't.  Grandma won't go.
This place is my whole world.  I will not leave.  Oh, but I'm so glad  my little Bolin has come back to visit. Sit down.  Would you like some tea?
Grandma,  we don't have time for tea.
Mom, please.
No! I can't abandon the place where I raised my family.  It's my home.
Grandma, there's one thing that Mako and I have learned from all our years on the street.  It doesn't matter where you go. If you have your family with you, you'll always be at home.
I'm not going.
Fine!  You leave me no choice.  We're rolling out!
Wait.  Okay, let's go.
Thanks for getting us out of there.  I mean, I probably could have handled it myself if you guys didn't show up, but thanks.
May she rest in peace.  This airship is nice. Is it our new home?
No, Grandma, I'm not sure where we're gonna take you. But right now, we need to find Korra.
Did something happen to the Avatar?
I'm afraid so.  Her airship went down somewhere in the desert.  She was coming from a military base near the Misty Palms Oasis and heading  to Ba Sing Se.  If we retrace her route back to the base, we should find the wreckage.
Guys,  it's the wreckage!  I found it.  There.
That's a Ba Sing Se airship, all right. But where's the rest of it? 
I don't know,  but there are some tracks. 
See? I told you, landing is hard.
Okay, guys, we think Korra found her way back here.  Now let's split off into teams and scour the town.  Yes, we'll need your help too, Pabu.  Now just give me a second while I-  Wait.  Pabu?  Pabu!
Why is Bolin hugging that big rat?  Ew.  Now he's kissing it.
I'm never gonna let you go again.
Guys, look out!  Giant dog-beast thingy!
Okay, all right, Naga.  It's good to see you too.  Ahh, stop.  You're licking my mouth.
Asami! Korra! 
You guys are okay! 
Sorry,  I was just-  It's so good to see you.
It's really good to see you too,  both of you.
Good.  You guys aren't dead.
Don't get all mushy on me, Chief.  Tonraq, sir.
Oh, my gosh.  It's Lord Zuko.  I can't believe it.
Uh, forgive my brother.  We're just really honored  to meet you, sir.
You must be the Avatar.  Mako told me so much about you.  You are even more beautiful than I imagined. 
Uh, actually,  that's Asami.  This is Avatar Korra.  Korra, this is my Grandma, Yin.
You are very... muscular for a woman. 
Um, thanks. You too?
What lovely young women.  Mako, why aren't you dating any nice girls  like them?
Uh... so what happened to you two? Where have you been?
We were captured by Zaheer and taken to Ba Sing Se.  We were there when the Earth Queen was overthrown.
What?  How did you escape?
Zaheer let us go.
Why would he do that?
Because he wanted us to find you and deliver a message.
Zaheer is headed to the Northern Air Temple as we speak. He said he's gonna wipe out the new Air Nation and everyone in it, unless you turn yourself over to him.
Zaheer's threatening innocent lives, just to get to me.
He  could be bluffing. 
He's  already taken out the Earth Queen. I don't think he bluffs.
We need to radio Tenzin and warn him that the Red Lotus is coming.
I agree. Unfortunately, We don't have a radio on the airship.
There's a portable radio in the jeep,  but the signal will never make it to the Northern Air Temple.
We need to get to a place that has a strong radio transmitter. The Metal Clan will have one.
Let's go. We'll radio Su on the way.  Hopefully she can get ahold of Tenzin at the air temple by the time we get to Zaofu.
Did you  have any luck getting through to Tenzin?
No one's answering.  What if Zaheer is already up there? I should never have let Opal go.
It's going to be okay, Su.
I hope so.
I can't just sit around here while a madman is on his way to the Northern Air Temple. We have to do something! 
I'll ready my airship.  With the full force of the Metal Clan Security backing us, we can take them. 
We'll never make it up there before Zaheer.
There might be another way to stop him. It's a long shot, but Zaheer is always meditating into the Spirit World, and I know exactly where he goes. Xai Bau's Grove. If I could find him there, maybe I could somehow trap him.
We can't protect you in there. I don't like it.
I'll be fine. I have to try.
I'll watch over her as she meditates.
I guess in the meantime, Mako and I will stay here and try to get through to the temple.
We'll help Su ready the airship. 
I'm going to take a nap.
Zaheer, come out!  Face me! Leave the airbenders out of this. 
There you are.
Iroh? What are you doing here?
I am. 
There's a maniac on the loose,  and he's threatening to destroy the new Air Nation. I don't know what to do. 
I know many Avatars have needed guidance, but I'm the only one since Avatar Wan that can't get help from my past lives. I wish I could talk to Aang.
Lord Zuko, of course.
Thank you. Thank you so much. You're right about the Spirit World.  I came here looking for someone else, but I'm glad I found you.
Did you find Zaheer? 
No, he wasn't there. But there's someone I need to talk to.
You're leaving?  Aren't you coming to the air temple with us?
I understand, you have to keep the Fire Lord safe. But before you leave, I was wondering if you could help me with something.
That's just it, you knew Aang better than anyone. I was wondering if you knew what he might do if he were in my situation.
So he would give himself up to save the Air Nation?
Thanks.  Your uncle was right. It was helpful talking to you.
Yes, in the Spirit World. A couple of times actually.
Guys,  we got through to the air temple!
Who is this?
I told you,  it's Bolin!
Bolin's not here  right now,  can I take a message? 
No, I'm not looking for Bolin,  I am Bolin! Ahh, look, I need you to find your dad.
He's outside with the bison.  Did you know we found a whole herd full of baby bison?
No. A whole herd, really?
Meelo, this is your commanding officer. Go get your dad, now.
Yes, sir. 
Come on. Come on.
Hello,  this is Tenzin.
Tenzin, listen to me carefully. Zaheer is on his way to the temple. He's coming for the airbenders. You have to get everyone out of there immediately. Drop everything. Leave now!
Oh, no. 
What?  What is it?  Tenzin! Tenzin, what's happening?
It's too late.  He's here.
What is it, Daddy?
We need to get everyone out of here.  Stay close to me.
What's going on, Tenzin?
It's Zaheer. Round everyone up. We need to get to the bison and evacuate immediately.
Guys, we got an emergency. We're evacuating the temple.  Come on.
Look out!
It's Zaheer. We have to leave.
Good, the entire family is here. 
It's a pleasure to finally meet a true airbending master.
What is it you want from us?
Nothing at all. In fact, if everyone cooperates, you will all walk out of this situation unharmed.
Then what are you doing here?
I want Korra,  and I'm tired of chasing her.
You're using us as leverage? 
Yes.
I will never let you get to Korra.
Unfortunately, you don't have a choice.
Yes, I do.
Jinora, get everyone out of here! Bumi, Kya, help me hold them off. 
And stay out of her line of sight. Go.  Go!
It's too dangerous.  We'll never make it to the stables with her up there.
No!
I see you're having as much fun as I am.
I can't wait any longer. 
Wait,  what are you doing?
Whatever I can.  Get to the bison! Get out of here!
Kai! No.
I got you.
Bumi, let go.
But we could die.
We're gonna die if we hang on.
Give up. It's over.
As long as I'm breathing,  it's not over.
Whoa! 
Thanks, buddy. Yip-yip.
I can't believe I'm sparring with the Avatar!       
I can't believe I'm stuck with her friend.    
Hang on,  I think I got it. Let me just try this.   
No? Okay, maybe if I-  ow!      
Trial by fire! It's the best way to learn metalbending.     
Oh, nice shot, Bolin.  But I thought you were supposed to be practicing metalbending, not earthbending.          
Yeah, cheater. 
Mako, metalbending is extremely difficult. No one gets it right away, if they can get it at all! It's not normal!        
Whoo-hoo!  Metalbending champion!     
Oh, sure. She's the Avatar.           
Guys, it's time to get cleaned up. Tonight's Opal's farewell dinner.     
Aw, now I gotta say bye to Opal? This is the worst day ever!  
Thanks for making my favorite meal.           
I'm really going to miss you, Opal. No one appreciates my raw veggie wraps like you do. 
Every time I eat raw kale, I'm gonna think of you.     
You're so sweet.          
This stinks. We were just starting to get to know each other and now you're off  to the Northern Air Temple.   
We'll be together soon. You guys are heading up after finding more airbenders, right? 
Yeah, but that's... in the future. Oh, I hate the future.     
Until then,  we'll always have kale.     
Kid, can I give you some relationship advice?       
Um, no.             
Well, your loss.  Zhu Li!  Bring the, uh, thing.  
Check out my latest invention.  An airbender finder.      
Wait, that can find airbenders?  
Uh...  I think  it's broken.      
It's not broken. She needs to  airbend into it!  How else do you expect the thing to work?!    
What's going on? I can't hear anything, I hate sitting down here.  Not because of you.       
I can tell you're lying.  
Everyone, if I could have your attention, please. Tonight, my beautiful little girl leaves for the Northern Air Temple.  Opal, none of us could be more proud of you. You're an incredible daughter, sister, friend,  and soon-to-be  airbending master. 
Here's to Opal. May she help lead us into the new era.     
Lock it down for the night.  
We'll head out first thing in the morning.    
Kale, kale, kale.           
What?  What's going on?  Pabu, sleep!     
What?  Huh? What? Pabu.  It's not play time right now. Okay,  we are seriously going to have to have a talk-  What the heck!  They got Korra!  They've got Korra!   
Let her go!          
They've got Korra!          
Back up plan.         
We can't let them take her.  
I don't think they're going to get far. Look.   
We have you surrounded, it's over. Release the Avatar!
No way!  That guy's lavabending, that's awesome...-ly  not good for us.   
I'm going to create some cover. We're getting out of here.  
How did they get in here?   
I don't know, but we're not letting them escape.    
Whoa! 
There's no way to cross that moat.   
We don't need to cross it. Lin and I can drop in from the dome on cables.    
That's a great idea. Except we'll get blown up the second that third-eyed freak sees us.   
She's a combustion bender. If one of you can stun her, her powers will be knocked out temporarily.    
Bolin can land a shot.    
I can?            
You have to take her out right before we drop down.      
I do?           
Open the hatch.  
If we get in trouble, metalbend us up.        
We're in position.      
Copy that. It's Bolin time.  
All right. Bolin time. Bolin time!   
I can't get a clean shot!    
You have to!        
Are we a go?  
No go.
Copy that. We're a go.
I said no! Wait!   
Bolin, take the shot!   
Nice job, little bro.      
No! 
Thanks.    
We failed!          
Where did they go?      
They can't be far.  Guards, search the entire estate!  
This should neutralize  the Shirshu toxins.      
How could you let this happen?  You assured me this was one of the most  secure places in the world.          
It is. I don't know how this happened. Obviously this was a well-planned operation, so  don't blame me.    
We searched the entire estate but there's no sign of them.  
Well, keep looking!      
It would seem they had some inside knowledge of Zaofu. They must have been working with someone.      
The-  the guards. It had to be one of them.       
I agree.           
Question them all! Whoever betrayed my city will suffer the consequences!  
What is your full name?     
Where were you last night?  
Do you have any knowledge of the people who tried to kidnap the Avatar?   
What was I doing last night?  Same thing I always do. From nine to ten,  I checked my body for ticks. Lyme Disease is a serious killer.  Then I did my nightly  Varri-calisthenics followed by  thirty minutes of breath holding. I filmed the whole thing if you want to watch it.    
That won't be necessary.      
Maybe it wasn't a guard after all. Maybe it was someone a little higher up the food chain. Aiwei, why don't you question Su?          
Lin, stop. Your sister wasn't involved.  
No,  I'll gladly be questioned.  I have nothing to hide.     
What is your full name?       
Suyin Bei Fong. I'm the daughter of Toph and  the only sister to Lin, and I had nothing to do with the attack last night.   
She is telling  the truth.   
This is a waste of time. Just bring in the next guard.  
Give me your name and tell me where you are from. 
Do you have any knowledge of the people who tried to kidnap the Avatar?      
Did you help the attackers enter Zaofu last night?     
You're lying.         
How did they get in and out?!  Where are they now?       
You're a traitor to the entire clan.       
I suggest we search his place.
I got something!          
What?   
It looks like it's from them.  "Team assembled. Ready to rendezvous."      
And look at this.       
These are the guards' log books. All their schedules and routes are in here.     
That guard knows everything.  We have to get him to talk.   
Let's go confront him with this evidence right now.  
No.  Let's give him a little time to sweat it out. He will talk eventually.
I don't understand why we're not talking to that guard right now.  Every minute we waste here, those guys get further away. I mean,  how does a random guard get involved with a group of super criminals, anyway?     
What do you mean?       
That guard is only eighteen years old, and has lived in Zaofu his entire life. Zaheer and his gang have been in prison for more than thirteen years. 
I don't know, but we all saw the evidence. It's pretty overwhelming.       
Maybe a little too  overwhelming?           
Hey, Varrick!  What are you doing here?   
Collecting pumice stones with Zhu Li. That lavabender did a lot of damage, but he makes a nice exfoliating rock. And when you got calluses like mine,  you take all the pumice stones you can get your hands on. Or in my case,  feet!   
What were you saying about the evidence?       
I was saying that I can smell a conspiracy when I see one. Look, if I was trying to set someone up, I would tell everyone he's guilty, and then plant the evidence in his apartment as proof.      
Oh.  You mean exactly like what you did to me?       
Yes!  Just like that. Remember how great that worked?  Well, not for you.          
You're right.  All the evidence points to this guard, but maybe he's just the fall guy.          
But for who?         
For the only person who can truly keep a secret in this city, Aiwei. 
He's not home. Or he's hiding in there.  Or he's invisible.    
Probably just not home.       
We have to get in there and find some evidence that links Aiwei to Zaheer, otherwise Su won't believe us. 
It's just an empty book.      
Oh, it's like a desert on a jar.          
Bolin, put that back. We don't want Aiwei to know we were in here if we can't find anything.      
Uh...  
You forgot where it goes, didn't you?   
Look at these scuff marks. I think this bookshelf slides open. 
What do you think is down there?         
Could be a storage cellar.  
Or it could be how Zaheer got in and out.      
Aiwei's coming back.  Quick!        
What are you doing in my house? 
You are trespassing on the property of one of the highest-ranked officials in the city. You had better have a good explanation.       
We do, we do. We actually knocked on your front door, and we thought we heard you say...  "Come in! I'm in the bathroom!"  I don't even know  why I'm saying that. You know I'm lying. And you don't even sound like that.   
We came here because things weren't adding up, and we thought you might have some answers.          
Sit. If you want to talk, let's talk over some tea. 
So,  what is not adding up, exactly? Hong Li was clearly lying, and we found evidence in his apartment.           
But don't you think it's weird how young he is? How did he ever get mixed up with this group?       
Perhaps through a relative. Or maybe he was bribed.  We will find out those answers in time. But if it wasn't him,  who do you think it was?    
We don't know.        
You don't think I had  something to do with this, do you?    
We're just looking for answers.      
And you think you found something, don't you?   
You have no idea what is coming for you, Avatar. 
Come on! He's getting away!          
I'm still a little new at this, so back off!      
Argh!              
He's gone.          
Look.  He must've escaped through there.  Help me clear it out.  
What happened?  We heard an explosion.     
Where is Aiwei?           
Your trusted advisor was the one who betrayed us.  He was lying about the guard.  
What?  No.               
We confronted him and he bolted through  here.   
He must have collapsed the tunnel behind him.     
And he rigged an explosion to destroy any evidence that might have been here.      
This is where Zaheer got in and out. Aiwei was the traitor.     
I...  trusted him.      
Is everyone okay?       
Aiwei is a fugitive. Get all available guards to search the mountainside and find out where this tunnel exits immediately! 
What did you find?          
We located the end of the tunnel, but there's no sign of him. Just some fresh tire tracks.  
He had an escape plan all ready to go.        
I trusted him with my life. I thought we were family,  but it was all a lie. 
Whoever these guys are, they're more powerful than we thought. And more dangerous.       
That's why we have to find them. We're going to hold off our search for airbenders and hunt down Aiwei. Naga can track his scent.       
And I bet if we find Aiwei, we'll find Zaheer.          
No.  We're not hunting this group. There could be other secret agents in other parts of the world looking for you right now. I'm taking you back to Republic City where I can protect you.  
If I wasn't safe here, then I'm not safe anywhere! I have to stop them.      
It's too dangerous. You are not going!          
Stop trying to protect me.  I'm the Avatar, this is my job! 
Don't lecture me about jobs! 
Enough!  Korra, listen to Lin.      
But. They-          
Please. Lin's only looking out for you. I promise you Aiwei and everyone he's working with will be brought to justice.   
Fine. If you really think it's best. 
I do.             
Thank you, Su.        
Everyone should get some rest tonight. I'll have my people prep your airship and you can leave first thing in the morning.   
Su.              
You really think Naga could track Aiwei?     
Definitely.         
Then here.  There's a jeep packed  with supplies by the East gate.  It's all gassed up and ready to go.
What? Why?          
Because I want you to hunt down Aiwei and bring him back to me.       
But you said-        
I said what Lin wanted to hear, and I bought you guys some time.  Go. I'll deal with Lin in the morning.       
Let's get this guy. 
Thanks.             
Aiwei's definitely been through here.  Nice tracking, girl.
Let's ask around. Maybe someone's seen him.
Ooh, look, they have a mover poster of me!  Must be big Nuktuk fans.  Yeah.  I should go over  and say hello.
No, those are wanted posters,  and there's one for each of us.  "Wanted by Her Majesty, the Earth Queen, for crimes against the kingdom."  I'm guessing this is because we took her airbenders?
They weren't hers to keep! I swear, if i ever see her pinchy  little queen face again, I am gonna- 
Uh, guys. 
We should get out of here.
Where is everyone? I've been waiting to leave for half an hour.
And good morning to you too, Lin. Now, don't get mad. Korra's fine. I'm just waiting to hear if she tracked down Aiwei yet.
What? You let Korra go?! I thought we were on the same page about this, and then you go stab me in the back?
Oh, don't be so overdramatic. You can't control the Avatar's every move.
I can try.
Naga found something.
Oh, sorry. I forgot to bring treats,  but good girl.
This must be Aiwei's jeep. He can't be far.
Bolin and I  will investigate the Misty Palms Oasis and see if he's holed up there.
Yes, I love it when you talk like a cop!
I'm coming too. 
No. You and Asami wait here in case he comes back. Besides, we don't want to call too much attention to ourselves.
Alright. 
Ooh. Mako, Mako, Mako, we should wear disguises and pretend we're going undercover. That way,  no one will recognize us.  Police work is so exciting!
All right, now we need our undercover identities.  I'm an ex-United Forces operative named Ting-Ting. War was the only woman I ever loved, until Ivy came along and showed me what real love is! Tragically, she was taken from me by my arch enemy Dr. Razor, and he-
Enough.  Let's just find Aiwei.
But I haven't even told you your backstory.
I'm a cop. I don't have a backstory.
Ooh, you're good at this!
Let's see if this guy knows anything.  Excuse me, sir.  We're looking  for a man about sixty, balding, wearing glasses, and a long green robe.
And he's got this weird piercing that goes from his nose  to his ear.  Freaks me out. 
That's him. Any idea where he is now?
Are you okay?
I'm just frustrated. What does Zaheer want with me? What's his plan? 
I don't know,  but I think I found a clue.
"Xai Bau's Grove, sundown." This must be where and when Aiwei's going to meet Zaheer.
All right, Xai Bau's Grove.  Where are you? 
Go away. I'm trying to find something.
Well, aren't you  a cute little-  Ow! Hey!
No luck here.
I think there might be a couple bounty hunters  over there who recognize me.
We've been made. Let's lose 'em.
Okay, I think we're clear. We should head back to Korra before someone  else recognizes us. 
We could, or we could follow Aiwei instead. Look.
All right,  play it cool.  Follow me lead.
Ting-Ting always finds his man. 
Keep an eye on him. I'll go get Korra.
We found Aiwei hiding in an inn.
That's great. 
We found something too.  It looks like he's going to meet Zaheer at sundown  at a place called Xai Bau's Grove,  but I can't find it anywhere on the map.
Let's go bust Aiwei's door down and finally get some answers.
No. Once Aiwei knows we're on to him, we lose our advantage. I say we stake out his room, and when he leaves for this meeting, we follow him.
And he'll lead us straight to Zaheer.
Good afternoon. We'd like a room on the ground floor across from 102, please.
Forget it. Last time a bunch of teenagers came in here, they trashed the whole room.
Hey, no bending in here! Take it outside.
Uh, I'd be happy to.  Always love meeting my fans.
Aww... It's... cute.
Why didn't you tell me your friend was a mover star? I'd be happy to rent you any room in the inn.
We'll just take the one across from 102.
But that room is too small for the four of you.
Trust me. It'll be perfect.
I'd just like to state for the record that this room is not perfect.  Naga!
There he is.
I thought stakeouts were supposed to be exciting. This isn't. At all.  Ooh, I wonder if there's any snacks in here. 
Hey look!  A Pai Sho board. Mako, you want to play?
Kind of busy here, bro.
I'll play. 
Oh, well... No offense, but I learned Street Pai Sho from Shady Shin,  and I am pretty good, so wouldn't really be a fair game.
So? I learned to play from my Dad, the diabolical genius.  I'll destroy you.
Well, looks like we have ourselves  a Pai Sho-down. 
Ladies first.
Hmm.
I don't want to rush you, but let's speed things up a bit.
Why? This game is all about slow, methodical strategy.
No, it's not; this is a fast-paced, edge-of-your-seat game of chance. Don't think. Just go.
I don't know what Shady Shin taught you, but it wasn't the real Pai Sho.
Oh, really? I think our friend  Mr. Rule Book might disagree with you.  "The origins of Pai Sho date back over ten thousand years. It is a game of both strategy and chance."  Wait, how could it be both? 
Let me see that.  "There have been countless variations of Pai Sho through the centuries, and each culture has its  own rules and variations on the game."
That's no help at all. Korra, as the Avatar, you need to standardize these Pai Sho rules.
Okay. I'll put that on my to-do list right after "Bringing back the Air Nation" and  "Taking down the group that tried to kidnap me."
That's cool. Whenever you get to it.
Assuming we  do find Zaheer, what then?
Then I make  him talk.
He was locked away for thirteen years, Korra, and never broke. I don't think a little bending is going to intimidate this guy.
You have a better idea? 
Yeah, we spy on them. If Aiwei and Zaheer don't know they're being watched, they'll talk freely. Then we'll know who they are and what they want.
That's just like Pai Sho!  "In order to defeat your opponent, you first have to know your opponent."
Then I guess I know you pretty well.  I win.
What?!  All right, all right. You know what? That was just a fluke. Best two out of three.
Oh, come on! Best four out of seven.
Eight out of fifteen.
Seventeen out of...  thirty-three?
Haha!  Looks like you're on the ropes this time.
I can't believe it. You might actually win this one.
No, Pabu! Why?
It's almost sundown.  Why hasn't Aiwei left yet? 
Maybe he slipped out when you weren't looking.
No, I just saw him peeking out the window fifteen minutes ago.  It's in my logbook.
I'm going over there. 
Korra, wait. You're gonna blow our element of surprise.
It's over,  Aiwei. Where's-  What?
That's a weird way to nap. 
He's not sleeping.  He's meditating.  Wait.  Asami, those spirits were trying to tell us something earlier. Xai Bau's Grove isn't on the map because it's not in the Physical World. It's in the Spirit World!  I'm going in after him.
We'll watch him in case he wakes up.  Be careful.
What happened back in Zaofu? You told me we wouldn't have any problems getting the Avatar. Because of you, we've all been compromised.
No, any evidence was destroyed  when my library burned.
Where is your physical body now?
At the Misty Palms Inn. But there is no need to worry, I was not followed.
You left a loose end.
I assure you no one knows anything about us.
No,  you are the loose end.
Zaheer!
It seems Aiwei was mistaken.  He was followed. 
That's right. We knew he'd lead us straight to you. So what did you do with him?
He'll be spending eternity in The Fog of Lost Souls,  which just leaves the two of us.
Don't move, Zaheer.  You're gonna give me some answers.
There's no need for aggression. Neither of us has our bending, and I'm not going anywhere. I'll answer whatever questions you have. You deserve that much.  What would you like to know?
First off, who are you people, and why do you keep trying to take me?
We are part of a secret society dedicated to restoring freedom to the World. We are the Red Lotus. 
Red Lotus? Are you related to the White Lotus?
We are what the White Lotus was meant to be. But after the hundred year war, the White Lotus lost its true purpose. Its members came out of hiding and openly served the Avatar. They became nothing but glorified bodyguards who served corrupt nations. So a great man named Xai Bau broke from the White Lotus and began his own society.
That's a great story, but it doesn't explain why you tried to take me when I was a kid.
That was Unalaq's idea.
What?  My uncle was part of the Red Lotus?
Avatar Korra.  Misty Palms Inn.  Find her. 
I met your uncle when I was a teenager after we had both joined the Red Lotus. We learned about Raava and Vaatu and how Avatar Wan foolishly severed them, disrupting the balance of the World forever.
Avatar Wan wasn't foolish. He was trying to restore balance.
He closed the portals, severing humans from spirits. Even you realize the error in his ways.
So all along, you and my uncle planned to use me to open the portals and release Vaatu? That's why you tried to take me when I was a kid?
Yes, and with members of the Red Lotus as your elemental masters, we could've taught you so much.
Sounds like you wanted to brainwash me so I'd do whatever you wanted.
No, Korra. All I wanted was to show the Avatar a better path for the World.
Uh, I don't know how,  but Water Arm Lady and Lava Guy found us. 
How?
I just said I don't know how.
Korra, come on, wake up.
What do we do? 
Get Korra out of here. 
Bolin and I will hold them off.
If my uncle came up with a plan to abduct me when was a kid, why wasn't he caught?
He wasn't with us that night, and he covered up his involvement afterwards.
So he betrayed you just like he betrayed me. 
Yes.  He allowed me and my friends to remain imprisoned while he pursued his own selfish goals. Unalaq becoming a Dark Avatar was never part of our mission.
And what is your mission exactly?
I want what you want, to restore balance to this World.
I don't think our ideas of balance are the same.
Are you sure about that? You kept the spirit portals open, but why stop there? Bringing the spirits back should only be the beginning.
What do you mean?
The idea of having nations and governments is as foolish as keeping the human and spirit realms separate. You've had to deal with a moronic President and a tyrannical Queen. Don't you think the world would be better off if leaders like them were eliminated?
No.  I mean, I don't really agree with what they've done, but taking out World Leaders isn't the answer.
It wasn't too long ago that the airbenders were nearly all wiped out thanks to the Fire Lord's desire for World Dominance. True freedom can only be achieved when oppressive governments are torn down.
But that won't bring balance. It will throw the world into chaos.
Exactly. The natural order is disorder. Do you know who once said, "New growth cannot exist without first the destruction of the old"?
No.
The wise Guru Laghima, an airbender.
I can't beat this guy!   It's like I'm giving him ammo. Want to trade?
You know, being locked away for so many years, I was beginning to lose hope.  But when I awoke with airbending, I knew I would be the one to destroy the Old World and plant seeds for a New World to flourish.
Zaheer, please. As an airbender, you could help make a positive difference in the world instead of destroying it.
You're a very smart young woman, Korra. But you must realize that once change begins, it cannot be stopped, even by the Avatar.
Enough with your philosophical mumbo jumbo. I want to know one thing. If you do capture me, what are you gonna do with me?
You'll have that answer soon enough. The Red Lotus should have you by now.  See you in the Physical World. 
Zaheer! 
Zaheer, you tricked me. Let me go!  Asami, are you okay? Where's the rest of the Red Lotus?
What's the Red Lotus? And Zaheer didn't capture us. The Earth Queen's forces did.
Where are we? 
I'm not sure.  Some camp by the desert?  They're taking us back to Ba Sing Se.
The Earth Queen's army snatched up the Avatar before I could.
Load them in the truck.  We're taking a trip to Ba Sing Se.
And of course, my biggest thanks  goes to Asami Sato  and Future Industries.  She brought our old central terminal into the modern era.  Ladies and gentlemen, the World is entering a new age of peace and prosperity.  Soon, Prince Wu will take  his rightful place on the Earth Kingdom throne.  And thanks to our updated rail system, Republic City and the Earth Kingdom will be united like never before.
I do like the idea of putting you on a train and sending you far,  far away.
Yeah... I'm aware of who you are.
Super-human?
Prince Wu,  President Raiko has some really important-  king stuff to talk to you about.
He's a real charmer, huh?
He's...  something. How can you stand being his bodyguard?
Well, I just remind myself that once he's on the throne, I go back to being a detective.
And that works? 
I also go home and smash my head into the wall for an hour. You know, just to get the stress out.
It's good to see you, Mako. It's been too long. You hear from Bolin lately?
I haven't talked to him for a while,  but he's coming in a few days for the coronation.  And Bei Fong told me that Korra is getting in tonight.
I can't wait to see her. It's gonna be weird having the old Team Avatar back in the city after all these years.
After your coronation the United Forces will escort you to Ba Sing Se.
Prince Wu, I assure you Kuvira has the Earth Kingdom pretty much stabilized at this point.
Well, the roving bandits have mostly been dispersed.
Don't worry kid. The chances of you being assassinated are almost zero.
It's safe to come out everyone,  the airbenders are here.
You finally made it!  So, where  are the rest of you?
Actually, it's just the two of us,  but we're going to do everything we can to help. I'm  Opal,  and this is Kai.
It's nice to meet you. 
What? I called Master Tenzin because my state has been under siege by bandits for months. They blocked all the roads, cut off our supply lines, and all he sent is you two kids?
Hey, us two kids just took care of those three guys for you.
There are hundreds more where they came from. My citizens are going hungry. Our entire state is on the brink of collapse.
Unfortunately, the Air Nation is spread thin right now.  We're all you have. 
We just got some good news.  Two more Earth Kingdom states  have agreed to join us.
That's great!  Zhu Li, dish out  some of that special celebration tea!
None for me.  I won't celebrate until the Earth Kingdom is one hundred percent reunited.
Why  have we stopped?
Apologies, there are rocks on the tracks. It's most likely bandits. We're sending troops to handle the situation.
Call them off.  I will take care of the bandits myself.
And you're the bandits who have been causing chaos  where I am trying to establish order, aren't you?
Don't talk over me. 
Stop groveling as if this is the worst day of your life.  This is a good day. I'm going to give you all  the opportunity to rehabilitate yourselves  and become productive members of your nation. Right now, you're lost, but pledge your loyalty to me,  and I'll give you a new purpose in your lives. Of course,  if you don't want to join, you could always stay right here.  Hopefully someone saves you before the next train speeds through,  but I wouldn't count on it.
I don't know why we're leaving so early if you're just getting a haircut. The dinner at Air Temple Island isn't until later tonight.
Are you kidding me?  What are you having done that takes four hours?
Yeah, I'm not interested. 
That's disgusting.
Uh... I don't know if all those people are your fans.
Boo!
Wu, we have to get you out of here.
Go, go!
I think those were Kuvira supporters in the crowd.
That's not blood, it's strawberry pie.
You would've  been hit by a pie. It's really not that big of a deal.
You're allergic to bee stings.
Look!  A train made it through.
Maybe they brought food and supplies!
Hey, what's your boyfriend doing here?
If he's here, he must be with Kuvira and my brother. This isn't going to be good.
Bolin! 
Kai!  Wow, you are a lot  heavier than you used to be, you're really growing up.
What's up with your new hair? You look like a stiff.
Hey, Kuvira says it makes me look intelligent  and professional.
Don't believe  everything she says.
Opal, I can't believe you're here too.  I missed you so much.
I missed you, too.
What a wonderful surprise. A happy reunion for my favorite couple.
Like you care.  She still hasn't forgiven you.
I guess when her son betrays her-
Please.  Opal. We're not here to bicker with you about something that happened three years ago. We're here to help this town, just like you.
I've heard how you help towns- by conquering them.
I know the rumors about me can be pretty nasty, but I am giving everyone in this nation a better future. And  with Bolin's help and  my fiance's ideas,  we're laying the groundwork for the people to achieve their own greatness.
Your fiance? 
You haven't heard?  Your brother and I are getting married.
Isn't that  great, sweetie? 
I know things got heated with your family  when Baatar and I left Zaofu,  but don't you think it's time to forgive and forget?
What are you doing here?
Hello, Governor.  I was wondering if you and I could talk privately.
So,  have you had time to rethink my generous offer?
Generous?  You want to take everything. How is that generous?
Governor, your state has been overrun by bandits.  They have you outnumbered and out-supplied.  The question's not if they'll take over, it's  when.  Unless you sign  our deal. Agree to the terms  and you'll have the full force of my army backing you. You will remain in charge, just under my supervision.  I will save your life, and the lives of your citizens.  I think that's pretty generous.
I know how you manipulate states and force them to join up under you. I know the only reason you want this region is because it's rich in ore.  They might call you "The Great Uniter," but you're destroying everything.  I'll never turn the great State of Yi over to you.
You have a lot of pride,  but it cannot protect your people.  Your pride will not stop the hordes  as your city crumbles to the ground, and your pride certainly will not feed your hungry  when all that is left is rubble. 
Leave! Get out of my state.
You will perish,  unless you take my generous offer.
It's time to go,  we're not wanted here.
What happened?
It appears we can't make a deal right now. 
Wait,  aren't you guys gonna stick around and help?
Here's the contract,  we'll wait at the border for one day. You get the governor to sign it,  and you'll have all the help you need. 
I guess I gotta go.
Don't, please!  You can't turn your back on these people!
I'm not. I want to help, but if the governor wants us gone, there's- there's nothing I can do.  I'm sorry-  Hey! Opal,  please.
Leave  if that's what you're going to do.
You know, we might not need their help after all.  The roads may be impassable, but not the skies.  We can use Lefty to fly to all the nearby villages, pick up supplies and fly back.
You're right.  We can save this town ourselves.
Sorry we couldn't give you more, that's all we could spare.
Every little bit helps.  Because of you and the other farmers around here, we have more than enough food to feed the town until we can get some reinforcements.
Thanks.
So...  you and Bolin doing okay?
I don't know.  It's really tough having a long-distance relationship,  and I can't stand that he's working with Kuvira.
I can tell. But it does seem like he found his calling, doesn't it? He loves helping people.
Maybe, it's just- he's changed a lot since he's been around her.
He's growing up.
I just hope we're not growing apart.  Speaking of long-distance relationships, how are you and Jinora doing?
Actually, we're doing fine.  You hear that? 
It's more bandits! 
We're hooked.
No!  Ah! 
Whoa!
What happened? Where's all the food?
We were attacked in mid-air. We lost everything.
It might be time to make a tough call.
Here,  tell Kuvira to save my people.
For what it's worth, I think you made the right decision.
Did I ever really have a choice?
When Korra gets here,  I bet she's not even gonna know who I am. 
Why is that?
Because  Meelo the Boy has turned into Meelo the Man. 
Right, you're completely unrecognizable.
Ugh. This coronation cannot some soon enough.  I can't wait  to go back to being a detective.
Right. Um, yeah, about that.
What?
I don't know how to tell you this.  You're going to Ba Sing Se  with the prince.
No!
I tried to get you out of it, but it's over my head.  Wu personally asked Raiko.  He said he doesn't know what he'd do without you.
This can't be happening. I'm not even an Earth Kingdom citizen, I work for the Republic City Police Department.
Not anymore. You're just a pawn in Raiko's diplomatic game.  You can try talking to him, but I don't think he's going to let you quit. 
The State of Yi is now under the full protection of my army.
Proclaim your  loyalty, if you wish to keep your post.
I pledge my loyalty to you,  Great Uniter.
Tonraq, it's good to have you back in the city,  and everyone is excited to see the Avatar again.
What do you mean?  Isn't Korra already here?
No, we thought she was coming with you.
Korra left the South Pole six months ago. She's written me letters. She said she was here in Republic City.
I assure you, your daughter's not here.
Then where is she? 
Is that all you got?
We have a winner! 
Here,  for your lackluster participation.
Thanks. 
You know, you look very familiar.  Yeah, you kind of look like that Avatar girl.
I get that a lot. 
Whatever happened to her anyway?
I wouldn't know.
You have to let me out! The Earth Queen is in danger from a group of terrorists calling themselves the Red Lotus!  I talked to one of them in the Spirit World yesterday. He- he's insane.
Screaming about terrorists in the Spirit World? You're the one who sounds insane.
Do I  have to be chained to the floor the whole way?  It's going to be so uncomfortable.
Sorry, ma'am. I'm under orders.
Can't you just  chain me to that railing?  I mean, where am I gonna go? Please.
Well, as long as you're chained up, I guess it doesn't make a difference.
Thank you, Sir.
Can I have some water? 
No water. We're also not gonna bring you any rocks or fire, so don't ask.  I guess there's air, but there's nothing we can do about that. We're not opening your compartment until we reach Ba Sing Se.
I hoped Mako and Bolin  would have shown up to save us by now. I wonder if they're okay.
If you think holding us hostage will give you some leverage to use against the Avatar, you're gonna be very disappointed.
And why did you need Korra alive back in Zaofu? You had her paralyzed, why didn't you just take her out when you had the chance?
Look, all you need to know is that the World is about to change, for the better.
So you guys were, like, locked up for fifteen years, huh? That must have been, like, crazy boring.
Actually, it was only thirteen years, but it felt like thirty.
I mean, what did you do with all that time? Did you sing songs, work on crafts?
And I must have renamed the constellations about a thousand times. When it rained, that was a big event.
Ooh, okay, that sounds like fun. Let me try that on you guys.  You were raised by an older sister. Your mustache grew in when you were ten. And I'm sensing- just sensing- an unspoken attraction  between you two.
Two out of three. Not bad.
Bolin, will you stop making friends with the bad guys?
Sorry.
Ghazan, gag those two. We're almost there.
We have to find a way out of this prison before we get to the Earth Queen.
Don't worry, I have a plan. These airships that Cabbage Corp sold to the Earth Kingdom are way cheaper than the ones Future Industries built.
Now, that's just shoddy workmanship.  There's no way I can get these locks off. I need the keys. 
Give me five minutes, then start yelling for help.
The airship already left Fort Bosco and should be arriving in a few hours.
Yes, Your Majesty. But first there are some people here who captured two of the Avatar's friends.  They would like to present them to you personally.
And of course I told them that, but they say they have some information that might interest you about the location of your stolen airbenders.
We don't want any bounty, Your Majesty.  You can consider these two a  thank you gift for simply taking the time to talk to us.
I'd be happy to tell you once you hand the Avatar over to me.
How I know is not important.  But if I found out, others will too. And that could put you in a difficult position.
Your Majesty, imprisoning the Avatar will cause the other nations to turn against you and demand her freedom. Before long, you'll be in the midst of a sticky international incident.  But if you let me take her today, no one need ever know she was here, and you can get your airbenders back without interference. We both win.
All I can say is that I have business with her. But she won't be bothering you again,  I can assure you of that.
Guard!  Get in here! Something happened to my friend! She needs help!
Where is she?
Nice work.  Now let's take control of this ship.
Mayday, mayday!  The Avatar has escaped.  We're going down in Quadrant Four of the Si Wong Desert.
I think you might have been a little  overaggressive with the airbending.  The controls are busted.  Also, you broke the radio.
Sorry, but it's not my fault this airship's a hunk of junk.
Hang on to something!
Well, they say any landing you can walk away from is a good landing. But given our location,  I'm not so sure about that.
You're the engineer,  what do you think? Can we get it flying again?
It doesn't look good. I mean, even if you metalbend the propellers back into shape,  we'd have to dig this whole thing out of the sand.
Is everyone all right?
Like you care.
What the heck happened?
She said her friend needed help. Then they knocked me out!
I'm sorry, but I couldn't let you take me to the Earth Queen as a captive. There are dangerous forces at work that you don't know anything about.
More dangerous than being stranded in the desert?
Don't worry, Kong.  I radioed Ba Sing Se before we went down. We just need to sit tight. Someone will be here soon to rescue us.
I'm not waiting around for that. We need to get out of here now.
If we all work together, we might be able to get the ship up and running.
Not likely. I just tunneled out of the engine room, it's like a sandbox in there.
This ship isn't going anywhere, and neither are you. You're our prisoners, and it's our duty to transport you to the Earth Queen.
You realize that I'm the Avatar, right?  You don't wanna fight me.
I'm afraid you aren't giving us much of a choice. We have our orders.
Wait, did that sand dune just move?
It was probably just a mirage. The desert will play tricks on you.
That's no mirage. Look.
I heard that since all the spirits came back, this desert has been haunted by them.
Oh, right, so I guess that's my fault too.  Do you want to help us get this ship up and running, or do you wanna wait around  and meet  that thing?
We wanna fix the ship.  Right, Cap? 
Hm, let's get to work.
Everybody, stand back!
We have to find a way out of here before Zaheer gets his hands on Korra.
Take me with you.  I haven't seen my wife and five kids in four years.
Four years?
The first few months were great. I could finally get some sleep.  But now I really miss them.
Listen, Bolin, this is up to you. I know you can metalbend.
You can metalbend?
No.
Yes, you can. I believe in you.
I believe in you too, Bolin!
I appreciate that, Mako and  fellow...  prisoner man, but I've been trying and trying and trying, and I've never  been able to do it! Not even  a little.
You've always had the ability deep down. You just haven't had the right motivation. But  this is your time. Get us out  of here to save Korra.  You can do it!  Bolin! Bolin!
Bolin! Bolin! Bolin! Bolin!
You're right. Okay.  Here I go.  Metalbending!  Agh!
I can't metalbend.
Aww.
Hey, you guys didn't happen to bring any toilet paper, did you?
First you scare the life out of me, now you want to lick me.
Here.  Chew on this, and leave me alone.
Tonraq, you read me? 
Yes. We copy.
I found Korra's jeep, but the kids aren't here. Meet me at the Misty Palms Oasis.
How's it  looking in there?
I just airbent all the sand out of the engine room. I think it's clean.
It hasn't been that clean since it floated off the showroom floor.
How's it going out here?
Well, she's still pretty banged up, but I think she might be able to limp out of the desert. Kong, you want to see if you can get the engine started?
Aye, aye.
All right!
That's no spirit! 
I think it's gone for now.
Kong, are you all right? 
What are we gonna do? All of our supplies were on the ship. We've got no food, no water.
Easy, Arik. Another ship is on the way. We just need to hold our position for a few hours.
We might not have a few hours.
How far are we from the edge of the desert?
Too far to walk, if that's what you're thinking.
We can't just wait around for that thing to pick us off one by one!
You'll do as you're told, airman. Now get a hold of yourself!
Maybe we can still build something to get us all out of here. 
You wanna make some wings out of scrap metal and flap real hard?
No,  but we might have enough material to construct a makeshift sand-sailer. Like the sandbenders use to get around. All we need is a sail and some kind of sled to attach it to.
It's worth a try.
Gather every piece of metal you can find. We'll give that sandy beast a run for his money yet.
Looks like he's in a hurry. Wait here.
It doesn't matter, we're through chasing her.  It's time to make her come to us.
Apologies, Your Majesty, but I couldn't help overhearing that the Avatar won't be joining us today.
That wasn't the deal.
Maybe I forgot to mention something to you.  I don't believe in queens.
You think freedom is something that you can give  or take on a whim.  But to your people, freedom is just as essential as- air.  And without it,  there is no life.  There is only...  darkness.
Hey, you can't be in here.
No need for alarm. I just need to make an announcement to the entire city. How do I do that?
Who do you think you are?
Ming-Hua, please. We're here to help citizens like him, not hurt them. Now, can you help me?
Attention, citizens of Ba Sing Se. I have an important announcement to make.  Moments ago, the Earth Queen was brought down  at the hands of revolutionaries, including myself. I'm not going to tell you my name,  'cause my identity's not important. I'm not here to take over the Earth Kingdom.  I think you've had enough of leaders telling you what to do.  It's time for you to find your own path. No longer will you be oppressed by tyrants.  From now on,  you are free. I deliver Ba Sing Se  back into the hands of the people.
We have to get out of here, Bolin.  Zaheer came here to take out the Earth Queen, and now Korra is next.
You know  that guy? He's my hero!
Shut up!  You have to metalbend us out of here.  Come on, I know you can do it! This is your time!
You said before was my time.
I know I did, but now it's really your time . Do it!
Did you see that?  I did it! I mean, not for us, but I metalbent all the other cells open!
I don't think that was you.
Listen to me.  I'm going to set you free, but I want to talk to you first.  I have a message that I need you to take to Korra.
She ain't pretty, but I think she'll do the job.
No time for a test run. Let's move!
I think he's gone. We did it!
You want to buy a slightly used sand-sailer?
Thanks, Asami. You've got a good head on your shoulders.
I'm sorry for getting us stranded out there. I didn't mean for that to happen.
You know, whatever the conflict between you and the Queen is, I'm sure  it's above my pay grade.  You got a tough job.  Good luck, Avatar.
Captain, have we been in the desert too long,  or is that really a dragon over there?
Ugh. Let's go get a drink.
Ah!  Easy, girl. Did you think we weren't coming back for you?
What are you all doing here? 
Korra, you're safe.
Yeah, we made it out of the desert,  thanks to Asami.
Do you remember Lord Zuko?
It's good to see you, Lord Zuko.
Thanks for ditching me back at Zaofu.
Yeah, sorry about that. But how did you all find us?
I am  a detective, you know.
Did you find Mako and Bolin?
Some people at the inn saw them get captured by Zaheer's crew.  We don't know where they are.
Did you hear about the Earth Queen?
What about her?
The Red Lotus. 
What's that?
The name of the group that's been trying to capture me and just took out the Earth Queen. I'm afraid  this is only the beginning, Dad.
I say we make our approach from the West, drop down from the airship on cables.  Ambush these Red Lotus lowlifes before they know what hit them.
It will never work. That Combustion Lady will pick us off one by one.
You have a better idea how to save the airbenders?
Yeah.  We come up from the valley, scale the side of the mountain, and take them off guard.
That could work.
And give them the high ground? No! If their lavabender spots us, he'll melt the mountainside and us with it.
Wait!  I got it.  I'll disguise myself as a lost hiker. And once I'm in the temple, I'll distract the Red Lotus with my bird calls.  Caw! Caw!  Caw! Caw! That's when you all strike!
Bird calls? Really?
Well, I haven't noticed you offering any suggestions.
It doesn't matter.  None of these ideas will work. The second Zaheer realizes we're up to something,  he'll wipe out the airbenders.
And Opal is one of those airbenders.  Believe me, I understand what's at stake.
Then I think you'll agree.  The only plan that will work is for me to give myself up.
What? 
Korra, no.
We'll figure out another way.
I talked it over with Lord Zuko, and I've given it a lot of thought. I have to do this.
You can't expect us to sit by and just let Zaheer take you.
The World has been out of balance for far too long. It needs the Air Nation back again. I can't let Zaheer destroy it and everyone we love.  Help me save the airbenders. Then you can can worry about saving me.
We're with you, Korra.
Yes,  whatever you need. We're here.
I'll go radio Zaheer.
Zaheer, are you there?  It's me.
I've been waiting for your call. So, do we have a deal? 
Yes. You release the airbenders, and then I'll turn myself over.
And take away the only leverage I have? No. I can't do that. Listen carefully. Here's what I want you to do.
Will you  sit down? I'm already tense enough as it is!
I'm just worried about Opal.  And Pabu's not here to comfort me. I hope he and Naga are doing okay back in Zaofu.
No.  Not Mako's scarf!  Bad dog and rat-thingy!  I'm very disappointed in you two.
Did you speak to Zaheer? 
Yes.  He told me to come to the top of Laghima's Peak at noon. Alone. Once he has me, he'll release the airbenders over to you at the temple. 
I think I figured out a way to play this  so the airbenders and Korra all come out in one piece.
How?
Zaheer doesn't know how many of us there are. So we have the numbers advantage.  I say we split into two teams.  Mako, Bolin, and Asami will take  the airship up to the temple.  Meanwhile, my metalbenders, Tonraq, Lin, and I  will get into position below Laghima's Peak.
Let go your earthly tether.  Enter the void. Empty and become wind.  Empty and become wind.
Thank you, P'li. For everything.
I want you to know,  not one day went by in that prison when I didn't think of you.
And after today,  we'll show  the entire World what it means.  No more prisons.  No more running.
I love you too.
Radio the second you see those airbenders. 
I will, Chief. Good luck.
Be careful, Korra. 
You too.
Korra. 
Don't worry, Dad.  I'll be all right.
I just want you to know how proud  I am of you.  The risk you're taking to save the Air Nation will be remembered for generations.
I love you, Dad.
I love you too, sweetheart.
And, Dad.  Watch out for Zaheer. He's not very fond of World leaders.
I can handle him. Just stay focused on your mission.
Oh, man.
Must have been some fight. 
Mako,  do you see the airbenders?
Not yet.  We're just arriving. Don't turn yourself over until I get a visual on them.
This way. 
You want the airbenders or not?
Drop your staff and surrender yourself.
Don't make me come get you.
Mako, what's going on?
They're here. But so is the lavabender.
Tell Ghazan to let the airbenders go.
Not until you turn yourself over. This isn't a negotiation. 
Wipe them out.
No! Wait! I'm coming.
Stand down.
We have her.
It's okay, Tenzin. We're about to get you out of here.
Korra, it was a trick!  They're not here!  Don't turn yourself over!
We had a deal!
Chief, get Korra out of there now!
Go! Go!
Nowhere to go, Zaheer!
Where are the airbenders?
I don't know.  Zaheer moved them out of the temple.
Come on. 
We have to get back to the airship!
Not gonna happen! The exit's blocked!
Where's Oogi? 
Gone. All the bison got scared off during the attack. But I think I know another way out. Bolin, can you get us through that wall?
On it!
Through there.
Is it just me? Or is it, uh, getting really warm  in here?  Oh, this is not good.  Let's move it, people!
Say hello to the Earth Queen for me.
Dad!
We're pinned down!
I'm gonna draw her fire.  You take her out.
Lin, no.
I love you.  Come and get me, you third-eyed freak!
P'li!
It's over, Zaheer.
Let go your earthly tether.
Release the Avatar!
Enter the void.
This is your last warning!
Empty and become wind.
No! Stop!
Did he just... fly?
Guess he doesn't need a ride.
Korra.
We can't outrun it!  This way!
Now what?
Bolin!
Incredible. 
You're a lavabender!
I know.  I just found out.
Hey,  you guys need a lift?
Kai. You're all right.
More or less.  Everyone hop on.
I owe you my life. Thank you, Captain.
You can call me  Kuvira.
Caw! Caw!  Caw! Caw!  Caw! Caw!  Caw! Caw!
Hey, everybody.  There's something I gotta tell you.
How did you guys make it out of that temple alive?
It was all Bolin.  I thought we were done for.  Then out of nowhere, he lavabends.
I knew you had the potential  for something big. You just had to believe in yourself.
You're right. Being moments from death was a pretty good motivator too. Of course, we never would have made it back without Kai.
Glad I could help. So anyway-
Did Zaheer get away with Korra?
I'm afraid so.
Apparently,  he can fly now. 
What?
How? 
Are you sure?
I wouldn't believe it either if I hadn't seen it for myself.
I've heard the legends about Guru Laghima's ability to fly. But I never imagined they were true.
So what's our next move?
I have an idea.
Not right now, kid!  We need to figure out where Zaheer took Korra.
And find the airbenders.
That's what I've been trying to tell you!  I know where the airbenders are, and I bet it's where Korra is too!
Well, why didn't you say something?
Where are they?  How did you find them?
After I got blasted out of the sky, I woke up on the side of the mountain,  where this little fellow  found me.  I tried to sneak back into the temple to see if I could rescue everyone,  and that's when I saw the airship leaving. I followed it to some caves a few miles from here.  That giant lady met up with some people who took the airbenders into the caves.
Was it Ghazan and Ming- Hua?
No, there were four more of them.  Didn't look familiar.
Must be more Red Lotus members than we thought.
I couldn't fight them all on my own. So I came back here, hoping you guys would show up.
We need to get to those caves.
How?  I don't think we can all fit on my bison.
Oogi! 
I'm glad to see you too,  old friend.
I wanna come with you.
No, Kuvira. Stay with the injured. We'll be back for you once we have the Avatar.
Hey, um, I appreciate you coming back for us. Sorry for ever giving you a hard time.
That's okay. I probably deserved it.
Yeah, you kinda did.
I wasn't sure I could.  Only one other airbender in history had the ability.
How'd you figure out how to do it?
I found true freedom. I am no longer bound to this earth by worldly desires.  I have entered the void.
She sacrificed her life for our cause. Now let's make sure it wasn't in vain.
You... You killed my father.
I understand your grief.  I also lost someone I loved today.  But your pain will soon be over.  Bring the poison.
When I get out of here, none of you will survive!
You won't get out. Unless The Metal Clan taught you a way to bend platinum.  Once we administer this poison, your body will naturally react, forcing you into the Avatar State in an effort to keep you alive. Sadly for you, you'll be entering it for the last time.
No! The Avatar Cycle...!
Yes. When we dispatch you in the Avatar State, the Cycle will end.  So we lucky few, this band of brothers and sisters in anarchy, are witnessing the beginning of an era of true freedom.  Together we will forge a world without Kings and Queens, without borders or nations, where a man's only allegiance is to himself and those he loves. We will return to the true balance of natural order. And though you will never again be reborn, your name will echo throughout history.  Korra, The Last Avatar.
Did you find any way to escape?
No, not yet. But don't worry. We'll find a way out soon.
They might not make it that long.
Korra will come  to save us, right?
I think we're going to have to do this on our own.
Administer the poison.
Get ready.  As soon as she's in the Avatar State, take her out.
Wait. 
Why isn't she staying in the Avatar State?
Give it time. She can't resist for long. 
The place where I saw them taking the airbenders is around here.
That's gotta be where they took Korra.
That's it!  Down there, Lefty.
Find the airbenders and my family.
Don't worry.  I'm not coming out without our children and the rest of your people.
It's working.
I told you,  Korra.  The World doesn't need you anymore.
The time of the Avatar is over, Korra.  Give up.
You're too weak to resist  and I'm stronger than ever.  There's no use fighting. Let go.
I'm thirsty!
I gotta go pee!
Me too.
Sir, please.  Could we just have some water? There are children and a baby here.
Mom!
Oh, honey, I'm so  glad you're safe.
Me too.
You're alive!  I can't believe it.
Why?  Just because I was blown out of the sky and fell hundreds of feet down a cliff?  Don't you know it takes more than that to get rid of me?
We have to get these two out of here now.  They don't look so good.
What are you talking about?  I feel great. 
You guys get everyone out of here. I'll search for Korra.
We're going with you.
You don't  have to search for her.  I know exactly where she's being held. 
Now! Destroy the Avatar.
Korra! 
We have to help her!
Look out!
You help Korra. We got this.
Daddy! 
Oh, thank goodness you're all right.
Honey, are you okay?
I'll be fine.
We have to help Korra.
What are you smiling about?!
I was just remembering the last time we fought.
Well, a lot  has changed since then.
So that's how you got out of the temple. Not bad. Let's see what you've got. 
You can't fight me and the poison.
I can fly up on my bison to help her.
You'd never be able to keep up with Zaheer. He's too powerful.
We have to do something!
How can he fly like that?
He's unlocked powers of airbending that haven't existed for thousands of years.
There haven't been this many airbenders in one place for a long time, either. We have power together.  Hurry! Everyone form a circle. Follow me.
You have no water. It's over.
Give up, Ghazan! You can't win!
I'm never going back to prison.  If I'm going down today,  you're coming with me!
Mako, hang on!
The poison has done its work. The Avatar Cycle will be over momentarily.
Korra, sweetheart.  It's me,  Dad.  Please hang on.
What are you laughing about?
You're too late!  The poison's been in her system too long. The Red Lotus has won.
You can  save her. The poison is metallic.
Dad?  You're alive.
I'm here for you.  I'm never going to let you go.
No!  No! You don't understand. The revolution has already begun. Chaos is the natural order of all- 
You see what I did there? I put a sock in it. Literally.
Classic Bolin.
I do what I do.
There you go. All fixed up for a  formal Avatar appearance.  Take a look.
It's great. Thanks.
You know,  nobody expects you  to bounce back right away. It's only been two weeks. You need time to heal. 
I want you to know that I'm here for you.  If you ever want to talk, or anything.  But let's just try to enjoy this today.  For Jinora.
You're right.  Okay. Let's go.
You look beautiful, sweetie.
You're looking stronger every day, Korra.
I'd like to officially welcome you back to Republic City.  I know that the last time we saw each other, it didn't end on the best terms, but I want to thank you for taking down those Red Lotus terrorists.
We should go inside.
I can help. 
I wanna ride with Korra.  Jinora's already inside.  It smells like shoe trees.
Sandalwood, Meelo.
I got this. 
Hang in there, kid.
She's not looking good.
Neither would you if you'd gone through what she had.
She'll be fine. She just needs time to heal.  The poison took a great toll.
Of course.  I'm just saying, with the Earth Kingdom  in complete disarray since the loss of the Queen.
Exactly. With the World getting more and more dangerous, we need the Avatar now  more than ever. Who will protect us  while she's in a wheelchair?
Jinora, come forward. 
Today we welcome the first airbending master in a generation,  and I couldn't be more proud of my daughter.  When the existence of our people was threatened, when the Avatar's life hung in the balance, Jinora never gave up hope.  Thanks to her leadership, I see a very bright future for the Air Nation.  Of course, there would be no Air Nation without Avatar Korra. She opened the portals and somehow the World began anew for us.  And she was even willing to lay down her own life  in order to protect ours.  There's no way we can ever repay her for all she's done. But we can follow her example of service and sacrifice.  So while she recuperates, the Air Nation will reclaim its nomadic roots and roam the Earth.  But unlike our ancestors, we will serve people of all nations, working wherever there is corruption and discord, to restore balance and peace.  Avatar Korra,  I vow that we will do everything in our power to follow in your footsteps and bring harmony to the World. 
Now, let us anoint  the master who will help lead us  in our new path.
Ooh. Pretty.
General Iroh, Are your ships in position?
It's time to take back the Physical World.
Monster attack!
They're over here!  Please, wake up. 
They're going to be all right, but I need to get them into some spirit water right away.
Thank goodness you're all okay.
Did you find Jinora?
I was able to rescue her soul, but she wasn't ready to return to her body yet. She sensed the world was in grave danger.
She was right.
Were you able to stop Unalaq and Vaatu?
No, they fused, then Vaatu ripped Raava right out of me and destroyed her. Vaatu won.
No! I'm too young to live through 10,000 years of darkness! Korra, can't you talk to one of your past lives or something?
When Vaatu destroyed Raava, he destroyed my connection to the past Avatars too.
If that's true, then-
The cycle is over. I'm the last Avatar.  I'm so sorry, Tenzin.
She needs you now, more than ever.
It's going to destroy the entire city.
We're going down.
Zhu Li, commence operation "Winged Freedom"!
Do the thing!
The other Avatars may not be able to help you anymore, but perhaps I can.
No one can help me now.
I know I haven't been the best mentor to you, but I realized it was because I had a lot of spiritual growth to do myself. There may still be a way for you to stop Vaatu.
How?
Let go of your attachment to who you think you are, and connect with your inner spirit.
Haven't you heard anything I said? Raava is gone. I'm not connected to a spirit anymore.
I'm not talking about Raava. Raava is not who you are. Come with me, I need to show you something.
Why are you showing me Vaatu's prison?
Because this tree had a history long before it held Vaatu. This is the Tree of Time, and the legends say that its roots bind the Spirit and Physical Worlds together.
And you think this tree can help me somehow?
Yes. I have read that long ago, the ancients would meditate beneath this tree, and connect with the great cosmic energy of the universe.
These are my memories.
The Tree of Time remembers all. Korra, the most powerful thing about you is not the spirit of Raava, but your own inner spirit. You have always been strong, unyielding, and fearless.
Avatar Wan.
Before he fused with Raava, Wan was just a regular person.
But he was brave and smart and always wanted to defend the helpless.
That's right.  He became a legend because of who he was, not what he was. He wasn't defined by Raava any more than you are.
Everyone in Republic City is in danger!
You have to help them, Korra.
How? They're halfway around the world.
Do as the ancients once did, connect to the cosmic energy of the universe. Don't bend the elements, but the energy within yourself.
You really think I can do this?
I have no doubt.
Thank you for not giving up on me.
I'm proud of you.
If you and Vaatu have the same fight every 10,000 years, why hasn't one of you destroyed the other?
He cannot destroy light any more than I can destroy darkness. One cannot exist without the other.
Find the light in the dark.
Uh...what did you say to her, exactly?
Korra's back!
And she's a blue giant!
You are looking for something that is gone. Raava has been destroyed, and soon you will be too!
They're coming for Korra!
Heeeeeelp!
Leave my Bolin alone!
I am so done with spirits.
Eska! I love you!  Let's face the end of the world together!
You're so romantic.
With you out of the way, I will be the one true Avatar.
Mommy, it's Jinora! She's... beautiful.
What? Let me see.  Be careful, sweetie!
No!
Raava!
Nooo!!!
Go in peace.
Harmonic Convergence is nearly over. We must return to the Spirit World so we can fuse once again.  
I'll see you soon, Dad. 
Gran-gran, I missed you. 
What about Korra and the others?
Don't worry, they're all right. Korra saved the world.
Her Avatar Spirit has returned.
It's over.
Haha.
I don't even know what to say. 
You were amazing.
And the way you turned all gigantic like that, wow! I just wish Varrick had been here to film it, it would have been the greatest mover ever! After the Nuktuk Chronicles, of course.
I'm sorry about your father, but he was already fused with Vaatu. I couldn't save him.
It seems Cousin Korra is under the impression we are saddened by our father's demise.
But I will not miss him at all. In the end, he became a deplorable man.
Agreed, but how will we explain this to mother?
So I was thinking, I'm not really a fan of the long-distance relationship thing. So how about you move to Republic City with me?
I do not think that will be possible.
Okay, Desna can come too.
I will not be joining you, Bolin. Desna and I must return home.
But you said-
Eternal darkness was upon us, I became caught up in the moment.
Yeah. I guess I did too.
But... you will always hold a special place in the organ that pumps my blood. I will remember you fondly,  my turtle-duck.
Bum-Ju, you're okay!  and I missed you, little buddy.
Now that you're bonded with Raava once again, are you also reconnected to your past lives?
No. I think that link is gone forever.
I see. Why don't you close the portals and we'll go home.
Maybe I shouldn't.
What do you mean?
What if Unalaq was right when he said the Avatar shouldn't be a bridge between the two worlds?  What if Avatar Wan made a mistake when he closed the portals? What if humans and spirits weren't meant to live apart? Well, what do you think I should do?
I think you should trust your instincts. There is nothing else I can teach you, you are the Avatar. Whatever your decision, I support you.
Hey, can we talk?
Of course.
There's something I've been wanting to tell you about that fight we had. I know I said it wasn't that bad, but that's not exactly true.  I, um- I broke up with you.
I remember.
But I thought you said you lost part of your memory?
I did, but being inside The Tree of Time brought it back. I'm sorry for blowing up at you.
That's okay.  I think we both said some things that we regret.
Why didn't you just tell me the truth in the first place?
I know I should have but... I didn't wanna hurt you all over again. I guess part of me wanted to forget about the breakup too.
I think we both know that this... Us... doesn't work.
You're right.
It's over. For real this time.
I'll always love you, Korra.
And I'll always love you.
You want a hug? 
The War of The Water Tribes is over. Unalaq has been defeated and the Northern fleet is returning home. The Water Tribes will always be allies, but the Southern Tribe is now independent! And the Southern Council of Elders has appointed my father, Tonraq, to be your new Chief!  I've realized that even though we should learn from those who came before us, we must also forge our own path. So that is why I've decided to keep the portals open.  Humans can now physically enter the Spirit World and spirits will be free to roam our world. I will no longer be the bridge. Humans and spirits must learn to live together. My mission will always be to use Raava's light spirit to guide the world toward peace and balance. Harmonic Convergence has caused a shift in the planet's energy, I can feel it. Things will never be the same again. We are entering a new age.
Come back, Bum-Ju!   
If you don't  wanna wear the sweater I made you, that's fine. I'm sorry I got mad.  
Bum-Ju, I'm running out of tree.  Can we go down now?  Bum-Ju, a little help?   
Ah! Ahh!    
Look! I'm airbending.  Ow! Wow, that still hurt a lot.   
How are we ever gonna clear away all these vines?  
Ugh!  I don't get it! I can vanquish Vaatu,  but not a bunch of stupid vines?
I'm sure you'll find a way.          
Why do you wanna get rid of them? You changed the World. We're connected with the spirits again. The wilds are their home. 
I don't think the people who used to live here are as excited about it as you are.           
I gotta  go face the press and tell them I still don't have a way to get rid of the vines.  This should be fun.       
I'm not concerned with snappy put-downs in the press. I'm facing this calamity just like every other citizen.  There's a tree growing right through my office. You think I'm not doing everything I can to get rid of it?  
Listen, I've been trying everything I can think of  to get rid of these vines, but-              
Look! Harmonic Convergence was just a couple weeks ago. I just need a little more time to get everything back to normal.         
The Avatar  has put us all in a very difficult position,  but my administration-     
Oh! I'm sorry.  Did I put you  in a difficult position by fighting  the giant force of Pure Evil that was going to destroy the whole World?  Maybe your administration  could've handled that! 
That's all! No more questions! 
This is a disaster.      
Don't worry, we'll figure something out.   
Easy for you to say.  You don't have my poll numbers. Eight percent approval? Who were they asking?      
You can't take that to heart. People are just frustrated.   
I don't blame them. I should be able to fix this. I'm the Avatar.         
You are not gonna believe what just happened. Where's your father?      
Daaad! 
What is it? What's wrong?     
The most amazing, wondrous, fantastical thing just occurred. Okay, Bum-Ju and I had  a little fight. I made him  this sweater, and he didn't seem to like it. And I'll admit it might need work, but it was my first attempt at knitting. So I was  a little hurt.   
Hilarious.  Time for dinner, everyone.      
No! Check this out.  I can airbend!  Yeah, wait.  Seriously. I was doing it.  Oh, hold on. I just... Maybe if I...  No.           
I swear I'm not making it up! 
Stop waving your arms around at the table. It's not funny anymore.  
It's not a joke.          
What's up with him? 
Bumi says he airbended earlier, but he can't now.  Oh, and I guess he's not very good at knitting either. I gotta say, I love being a part of this family.  You got the grumpy dad,  the wacky uncle.  The put-upon Mom,  crazy kids.  This is great. 
Where's Mako?         
Oh, you mean the brooding teenager? He's staying at the police station.     
Still?            
I told him Tenzin invited us to stay here since our apartment is a vine habitat now, but he said  he had to focus on work.   
Oh! Did you see that? I think the napkin moved!       
You blew on it.           
Wait!  Maybe I can only do it when my life is in danger. Bolin,  bend a giant boulder at me.           
Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.  
If you're gonna be bending giant boulders, you can do it outside.     
No one is bending giant boulders! 
Look alive,  Uncle Bumi!
Ah!  I told you! 
Unbelievable. You're actually an airbender.  
Wait until I tell Mom. She's gonna love this.     
Ow! 
Police.  He what? Slow down. Okay, I'm on my way.      
What the heck  did all this?   
It was my brother. He's out of control!      
Okay, just tell me what happened. 
We were arguing about the books,  and Daw was yelling at me, and all of a sudden things started flying around! He was creating this storm like...             
Like what?          
Well, like he was airbending.     
Sir... That's impossible. There are only five airbenders in the entire World, and your brother is not one of them.       
I know what I saw. He was freaking out, yelling, "What's happening to me?!" Then,  he ran into the back room and locked himself in.       
Police. Open up.          
Go away!              
Get out here, Sir, or I'm knocking this door down.  One... Two... 
Ah!  I'm so sorry!  
I told you! Airbending! 
Ugh! I can't figure this thing out! 
Do you think being in the Spirit World during Harmonic Convergence could have given him bending?     
I suppose it's possible.     
Maybe Uncle Bumi is just a late bloomer.     
I have been noticing a change in your aura lately.  
And you didn't tell me?    
Invisible spirit monster attack?     
Lin! You won't believe this. Bumi just started airbending. 
I'm afraid he's not the only one.     
I got a call last night about a guy who just started airbending out of nowhere.      
You mean there's another one? Where is he now?        
He... blew a door down on me and got away. We've got an all-points bulletin out on him right now. 
Wait,  we'll help you look for him. Where should we start?     
Oh, well,  you know, you should...  You should leave it to the police. It's... police business, you know. It's, um... official.   
Okay.  How are you doing? You know you're welcome to stay here instead of sleeping at the police station.     
No,  I'm fine. I should just... get...  going. So! As you were...  Ladies. 
This is so exciting!  New airbenders in the city? I bet we can find that guy before Mako does.  You know I'm not very good at this.      
You're the Avatar, master of all the elements. You should know how to drive. Besides,  it's relaxing.     
Clutch!  Clutch! 
That's the brake.  Let's try again.  You ready? 
How long do you think talking to Mako is going to be like pulling teeth?       
Well, Mako  has never been the most  "in touch with his feelings" guy.  But, it'll get better eventually.           
So when I was gone, did he tell you that we broke up?           
Yeah. We all knew. Sorry.             
That's pretty embarrassing.  
Actually, I need to tell you something about that,  and I should've told you this sooner, but...While you were gone, I... kind of... kissed him. I'm sorry. 
No wonder he's so nervous around us.              
You're not mad?         
No! I mean, I kissed Mako when he was going out with you, so. 
You what?           
I'm so sorry! I thought you knew!       
I'm just kidding. I knew a long time ago.     
Well, whatever happened with Mako, I'm glad it hasn't come between us.  I've never had a girl friend to hang out with and talk to before, except for Naga.  This is nice.      
Vine! Vine!          
Hey! Watch where you're going!       
What are you doing  living in the middle of the road in the first place?       
Don't ask me, Avatar.  You made the world this way, we're just living in it.  
Look, I don't have anything against spirits, but  these vines are causing major problems all over the city.          
Spirits? Vines?  We're all the same. Seems like the Avatar would know that. 
Korra, you okay?          
I think that spirit just gave me an idea how to get rid of these vines.  But I'm gonna need a lot of water.       
It's like a dream, Dad. After 170 years, new airbenders.         
Dad?  When a new guy gets airbending,  does that make him our brother?          
Well, in a way, all airbenders are our family. 
Does that mean I have to share my room? Because I like my personal space.          
Of course not. But we might have to get used to not being the only airbenders around any more.        
I hope we have enough for an army.  I wanna be a commander like Uncle Bumi.        
Air Nomads don't have armies, Meelo.             
But maybe there will be  enough to fill the temples again.      
What's wrong, Daddy?     
I just wish your grandfather were here to see this.    
Will you be Airbender President?      
No. But I think the new airbenders will need lots of help and guidance to understand what it means to be a part of our nation.  That's a big responsibility.   
Don't worry, Dad.  We'll help you.
I know you will. 
I hope  this works.     
What are you guys doing here?           
I was alerted that you had a new plan to wipe out these noxious weeds.  So I thought you'd want everyone to be here to watch.  
No questions! Just stand there. Silently!      
Go in peace.          
Look out! 
Let's go, people.  Hurry!  
Hang on!      
I think that could've gone better.      
Can't talk. Meditating.        
You must be at the end of your rope. You hate meditating.        
I thought that if I really tried I might be able to contact my  past Avatars,  someone who knows something to help me. But I can't. They're gone, and I'm all alone.  Did I ruin everything by leaving the spirit portals open?     
You didn't ruin anything. You did what you thought was best for the World,  and now things have changed. Change can be good or bad. Depending on your point of view.     
I know  the people's point of view. It's bad.               
You're not the President, Korra. Your job isn't to fix the daily problems of every person in Republic City. Your responsibility is to bring balance to the entire World. And that means no matter what you do, some people  are not going to be happy about it.      
Great.            
In the other hand,  some people will be very happy. Like me.  What you did during Harmonic Convergence may have brought back the Air Nation. And that can only be good for restoring balance. That is the act of a great Avatar.          
It's scary. I have all this power and all these people depending on me,  but I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing half the time.  It seems like I should be... wiser.             
True wisdom begins when we accept things as they are. You started a new age, Korra.  There's no going back to the past.  
Mako called!  The cops found the new airbender guy. But when they tried to bring him in,  he ran away and climbed to the top of Kyoshi Bridge and he won't come down. Ooh! Sorry. Did I interrupt an Avatar wisdom session?       
Avatar wisdom is a thing of the past,  Bolin. Come on! 
Oh, okay. Is that a good thing?      
Depends who you ask. 
Come down immediately,  or we will be forced to take action.         
Stay back! I'm dangerous!   
Sorry!     
Don't panic, I'm just here to talk.     
Please! I don't know what I'm doing, and I don't wanna hurt anyone. 
Tell me about it. Rough day, huh? I'm having kind of a rough day myself.  You mind if I sit down here? 
Look,  I know you're scared. You've gone through a big change, and it's kind of my fault.  But you're not alone. There are other airbenders  and they wanna help you. Actually they're really excited to meet you.      
I don't wanna be an airbender. Please!  You're the Avatar. Make it stop! 
I'm sorry, I can't. But I promise you, things will get better if you just give it a chance.  Let me take you over to Air Temple Island and we can talk this through, okay?              
Daw, this is Tenzin. He's going to help you.     
It is absolutely my pleasure to meet you, Daw. I've never met a new airbender before. Well, at least no one whose diaper I didn't have to change.    
Actually I just fell off a bridge, so I could use a fresh diaper right about now.  
We have a crisis every other day now, thanks to you.         
Listen, I know you're having a tough time getting used to these changes, and I'm sorry for that. But you and everyone else are gonna have to learn to live with it. The vines and the spirits are here to stay.           
Well, you know who's not here to stay?  You!  I order you to leave this city. You've caused nothing but trouble since you arrived! 
Don't worry.  I was already leaving. 
I can see my path now. There are new airbenders out there, and I'm gonna find them and rebuild the Air Nation.   
Don't think I'm not going with you.  It's so exciting. Who knows who's out there right now,  discovering the gift of airbending for the first time? 
Of course. 
Have you ever read the poetry of the great airbending Guru Laghima?            
Guru Laghima lived four thousand years ago in the Northern Air Temple. It is said that he unlocked the secret of weightlessness and became untethered from the earth,  living his final forty years without ever touching the ground.           
Laghima once wrote, "Instinct is a lie. told by a fearful body. Hoping to be wrong."      
It means that when you base your expectations only on what you see,  you blind yourself to the possibilities of a new reality.
Ah, ah, ah.  You wouldn't wanna singe your friend, would you?  
Nature is constantly changing, like the wind.   
Now you might wanna ration  that bowl of rice.  You've got three weeks until the next shift change.  It's the dawning of a new age,  the end of the White Lotus, and soon, the end of the Avatar.     
Did you see Zaheer?
That's not a snowstorm. That's him.
I put you away once Zaheer, and I'm gonna do it again.
I never doubted.
Really? Right now?
I got them. These passports should get you into the Upper Ring.
Awesome! Tu, you're the best cousin a guy could have!
And my other cousins as well. Yeah. Yeah, you're all the best. 
Thanks. I know this wasn't easy. 
It's such a shame you two must leave so soon.
I wish we could stay. But if it's true the Earth Queen is forcing airbenders into her army, we have to do something about it.
I love you both. Come visit again.
We will, grandma.
I love you too, grandma.  And Chow. And Tu.  And Meng Meng. And Chow Junior and  there he is, Big Ti and Little- Little Ti and Medium Yu and... and- and what was your name again?
I know that Earth Queen  is lying to me!  I can tell  by that stupid little queenie  smirk of hers!  And I can't believe I helped her!  I should have known she was  using me! 
Whoa! Hey! I think  I could use a break.  You letting off steam is  starting to...  Hurt.  A lot.
Sorry.
Mako! Bolin!
You're okay. Where have you been?
We chased Kai. Train. Slipped away.  Lower Ring.  Slept in trash pile.  Met our family!  Grandma tears.  Mako's scarf.  Earth Queen...  lying.
Can you interpret that?
The Earth Queen's been secretly taking airbenders, and forcing them into her army. 
She was lying! I knew it!  I swear the next time I see her-
It's the Queen.
Quick! Pabu, shirt!
I know. Sorry. Kinda sweaty.
We've received word from the Yang province. There have been reports of airbenders there.
Thank you. That is just the most wonderful news. Ever.  Yay.
No, Your Majesty.  I would never allow  an animal near you!
Err... this evening?
I'm not sure about leaving so soon...
Because our airship is having engine trouble. It'll take me until tomorrow to finish the repairs. 
Thanks for buying us some time. 
I can't believe the Earth Queen is conscripting airbenders. 
Those people should not be forced to join an army.
Well, technically the Earth Queen has a right to conscript her citizens. 
What? It's true. 
Guys, what if  Kai was spotted airbending? He might have been taken too.
Probably not. He's surprisingly difficult to catch.  Like a- like a little greased hogmonkey. 
But, what if he was?
Don't worry, Jinora. We'll find him. We just need to figure out where to look.
I bet they're under Lake Laogai. 
What? I've been reading some of Jinora's books.  The old Dai Li agents used to have a secret fortress beneath the lake. 
Mako's right. It's the perfect spot to hide airbenders.  And I know how to check it out without being caught. I can project my spirit into it.
You mean that out of body thing you did to help giant spirit-y Korra?
Who can still do that?
It's not as powerful as it was during Harmonic Convergence, but if I can get close enough, I think I can do it.
Let's go get Kai out.  Let's get all the airbenders out.
Go easy on me!  I-I'm not that good. 
Sorry.
I'm not a soldier.
If anything goes wrong, come back immediately. 
I will.
What happened?  What did you see?
The airbenders aren't there. It's completely deserted. 
They're not down there? 
Jinora, you've read all about Ba Sing Se. Can you think of any other places the airbenders might be? 
I guess they could be in the catacombs beneath the Upper Ring.  Or the ancient sewers beneath the Lower Ring. Or the maze of tunnels that  connects the rings together. Or they could be-
There are just too many places. There has to be another way to locate them.
Maybe there is.  How did you find me during Harmonic Convergence? 
I don't know.  I just kind of focused on your energy. I think our spiritual connection led me to you. 
Maybe you can find Kai the same way. I know you two have a connection.
What do you mean a connection? 
I don't know.  Let me try. 
Thanks. 
Jinora?
It worked! 
How are you here right now?
Shh. Quiet. It's a high level airbender move with a little spiritual stuff thrown in. 
For a second there, I thought you were a ghost.
It's good to see you.  We've been looking for you and the other airbenders. We're going to get you all out of here.  Where are we anyway?
Underground somewhere. Other than that, I don't have a clue. 
I'll figure it out. Don't worry.
Jinora! Thanks.
The Earth Queen's temple.
I can't believe Miss Queenie Smugface had them right under our noses the whole time!
We have to get into that compound tonight, and get those airbenders out.
Alright,  we go in under the cover of darkness.  Two small insertion teams and  a third on the outside.  Then all we'll need is twelve tons of blasting jelly, a medium sized bulldozer,  and does anyone have a badgermole that knows morse code? 
Oh great. Not the Queen again.
Everyone,  act normal.  And Bolin-
I'm on it!  What?  Hey, I'm not sweaty this time! 
Lin?  What are you doing here?
We need  to get Korra  out of here immediately. Her life's in danger. 
What?  What's going on? 
I just got word from Lord Zuko and Tonraq. 
Why is Lord Zuko with my Dad?
Zaheer and the others have escaped.
How is that possible?
Because Zaheer is an airbender now.
No.
Alright,  hold on.  Will you quit ignoring me and tell me  what's going on?  Who's Zaheer?  Why is my life in danger? 
Shortly after we found out you were the Avatar, Zaheer and three others attempted to kidnap you. Luckily, your father, Lord Zuko, Chief Sokka, and I were there to stop them.  We apprehended the criminals and locked them away in prisons designed to impair their abilities. 
So that's why you and my Dad sheltered me away. 
It was for your own safety. 
Why were they  trying to kidnap Korra?
We spent thirteen years interrogating them, but they never broke. To this day, no one knows what their motive was.  Now we need to get you back to Republic City where I can protect you. 
No.  I'm not running. 
Korra, you don't understand.  These criminals are like nothing you've ever faced before. 
Look, I'm not a little kid any more. You don't need to protect me. I came here for one thing, to find airbenders, and I'm not leaving without them.
Fine. Let's get them and get out of here. Where are they?
In a military compound,  and we're busting them out. 
Hi. 
I'm not alone. 
Bumi and Korra, you two will come with me to find the airbenders.  You three find Kai. We'll meet on the surface shortly. Radio us if anything goes wrong. 
What's going on? Who are you?
I'm the Avatar. And I'm getting you all out of here. 
We're leaving? Where are we going?
Everyone, please.  You must stay calm and quiet if we want this to work. 
What to work? We're sneaking out? 
Yes, and we must leave now.
We're going to get you away from the Earth Queen and out of the city.
There's an airbender that's not here. His name is Kai. We need to get him.
We're already taking care of it.
Tough Sight, this is Papa Bear. The Breezies are in the hole, cue the Balloons!
What? Are you in trouble? 
No, we got the airbenders and we're headed out. Bring the airships!  No one likes code names any more.
Copy that. Asami and I are on our way. 
C'mon. We're getting you out. 
Kai! 
Whoa oh!! Tenzin is not  going to be happy about this.
Then don't tell him. 
How can I not? This is too juicy! 
Thanks for coming to get me.  I'm really sorry about stealing your wallets. And running away.  And getting you stuck on that train.  
Aww, we can't stay mad at you. 
Yes, we can. I have a lot of money in that wallet. 
Guys, come on!
Come on. It's clear. 
These airbenders shouldn't be used as weapons! They have a right to choose their own paths. 
They're leaving with me.
Come on!
I guess I am as good as I thought.
Everyone's in! Let's go.
Oogi!
Where are the others? 
We need  heeeeeelp!
Everybody! Hang on!
Whoa! That was awesome!
I know that none of you chose to become airbenders.  But now, you do have a choice. We can relocate you somewhere safe  or you can come with me to the Northern Air Temple to live in peace and train as Air Nomads. You are no longer anyone's property. What path you decide, is up to you.  
I want to go with you.
Good luck at the Northern Air Temple. I'll send more airbenders your way when I find them. 
Be careful out there, and stay safe. 
I'll try. Seems like where ever I go, I make a new enemy. 
But you made some new friends too.  You did well, Korra. 
This is only the beginning. 
Did someone order  a fully-equipped Future Industries airship?  
It's perfect.  Thanks, Asami.         
I figured if we're  going to Ba Sing Se to search for airbenders,  we should do it in style. 
Yay! Airship!         
I wanna see! 
Come on, Poki. 
While you guys are gone, Pema and I will hold down the fort.  Who's excited to spend some time with your Auntie Kya?  Oh.       
Aww. He likes you. 
Mako,  I'm so glad you're here.    
Of course, Korra.  Avatar. Avatar Korra.  Once I received your message, I proceeded to contact various locations within the Earth Kingdom as ordered by you,  the...  Avatar.           
Right. The Avatar thanks you for your loyal service. Did you find any more leads?  
There are reports of airbenders popping up all over the Earth Kingdom. I marked the villages on this map.  You guys can take it with you. 
Actually, I was kind of hoping you could come too.       
Really?  Um, it's probably better if I sit this one out.
I know things have been weird between us since we broke up, but you're a part  of Team Avatar and we can't do this without you.          
I'm sorry, I can't. 
I'll miss you, Sweetie. 
I'll miss you too. Once we find the airbenders, I'll send word. You can join us at the Northern Air Temple then.
Hey!  How come Jinora gets to go with you  but we don't?!  That's so  not fair!      
Yeah, what  this girl said.  Not fair!    
Because if airbenders show up here, they're going to need some guidance from you two.  It's a very important job.      
Really?  Me, a teacher?  Yay!              
Those maggots will bow to me! 
Go easy on them, son.     
Mako, wait a sec.       
Korra already asked, bro. I can't just leave Republic City. I have a life here and a job.              
A life? You sleep under your desk. And what's a more important job than helping the Avatar rebuild an entire civilization?     
It's not just that. I feel like I've been drifting apart from everyone. 
Well, drift back!  We need you. Come on, Mako, we're going to Ba Sing Se where Dad grew up. What if I meet our grandma for the very first time? And she asks me,  "Where is your sweet brother?"  And I have to say,  "I'm sorry, grandma. He had some really important police paperwork to file."  And she starts to cry those grandma tears and is like,  "Mako! Why? Why, Mako?  I can't go on.  I can't-"  and then she dies.          
Okay,  all right! I'll come with you.  I guess I gotta call Bei Fong. She's not going to be happy.          
Bye. We'll miss you.        
As of now,  these are the towns where we've gotten reports about airbenders.  It looks like we can hit up most of them before we get to Ba Sing Se.  
We're going to bring the Air Nation back from the brink of extinction after nearly 200 years. 
And it's all because of you, Korra. 
It's nice to see you again, Ghazan.             
Thanks for busting me out.  Where'd you pick up the new skills?         
I have Harmonic Convergence to thank for that. I was given a gift.  I believe it's a sign that our path  is a righteous one.  
Avatar Korra!  Oh, it is such an honor to have you come  to our humble village.     
Thanks.               
I hate to get down to business,  but is the airbender here now?     
Kuon and his family will be joining us shortly for a special dinner. Please,  right this way.     
Kuon has been the talk of the town ever since he got airbending. He's like a local celebrity.  
I just want to say that it's an honor to meet a fellow airbender.  
Oh, I still just think of myself as a simple farmer...  Who can airbend.  Oh, I'm so sorry. I still don't have any control.          
No worries.  I love pie.  And so does Pabu.  
Well, you're so much more than just a farmer now.  Harmonic Convergence changed everything.  You represent the future of a culture that is being reborn. You're going to help us rebuild the Air Nation.     
I'm gonna do what now? The only thing I'm planning to rebuild is my barn.     
But you must come with us to the Northern Air Temple.   
Well, I can't do that.  I have a family and a farm.   
Of course you can come. This is of the utmost importance! Your wife will understand.      
Wait, what? No, I do not understand.    
No one's going to take Daddy away, sweetheart.     
Actually,  this bald man does want to take him, but it's for an important cause. Your Dad is an airbender, and he should learn about his culture.   
I think there's been some sort of misunderstanding.  I'm not going with you. I might be able to airbend,  but I'm no Air Nomad! I'm no monk!          
Okay,  uh, maybe we should just have some dessert, huh?  Who's up for dessert?      
Sir, you must understand. You're an airbender now, and there are thousands of years of culture you must learn about. Skills you must master.     
You expect me to abandon my entire life? My family? No!  No, sir! I'm not going anywhere with you and  I think it's best that you leave! 
In my head I saw that playing out very differently.  
Maybe we should have stayed and tried harder to convince him to join us.   
Or we  could've thrown him into a potato sack and forced him into the ship. 
That's how they got me to join the United Forces.      
No, we can't coerce people.  Or throw them in potato sacks. They must come freely. But not to worry,  there are plenty of other airbenders out there who will be happy to come with us once they find out what the Air Nation's all about.   
When your son becomes a master, he'll get tattoos all over his body,  just like me.  
There's nothing more nutritious than our vegetarian diet.       
I can tell that  you're going to love wearing our  ancient airbender robes. They're very breathable.    
You'll never have to worry about your worldly possessions again because you won't have any.   
You'll get to shave your head!        
Your best friend will be a giant bison!     
I really thought I had that last guy.  Who doesn't want a bison as their best friend?      
It's okay,  Tenzin. I still want to be an airbender.          
Okay, we've tried it your way, and people just don't seem to be responding.  It's time for a little tough love.      
How old is he?        
Well, I have a great opportunity for him.  We're looking for airbenders to join us at the Northern Air Temple.   
Hi, I'm Korra.       
So, you're like the Avatar or something?  Big deal.     
Uhh...  I just wanted to talk to you about an opportunity.     
Yeah, I heard you talking to my Mom,  and I'm not interested.     
Well, you're gonna be interested! 
You're an airbender now, and you have a responsibility as a citizen of the world.               
Whatever. I didn't ask to become an airbender, you know.     
Well, I didn't ask to be the Avatar,  but I am, and I'm fulfilling my duties.              
So? You don't have to.          
Yes, I do have to.      
No, you don't. 
Yes, I do.          
No, you don't.        
Well,  if I didn't embrace my role, then our entire world could be thrown into chaos. Think about that. Is that what you want?
Maybe.            
No, it's not!         
So what? Who cares?      
Everyone cares!           
I don't care.         
Yes, you do!         
No, I don't.         
Well, you're about to care,  you little slacker, because you're coming with me!   
Stop pulling on my collar, you're stretching it out. Mom, are you just gonna just let her take me? 
No! Let me go!     
That's it!          
Korra, enough!  Let's get out of here.     
So nice to meet you. Good luck with your son. 
Great to see you too, Ming-Hua.               
We're getting her next.       
Well, I guess we should just go to Ba Sing Se and try our luck there.     
I don't know what to do. I just thought more people would be excited about coming with us.      
Well,  maybe you gotta do more to get them excited. You need to add a little  razzle dazzle. 
Yeah, razzle dazzle. We could put on some sort of airbending street performance. 
I was going to say we could cover Tenzin's robe in sequins,  but that's even better. 
It sounds ridiculous, but it might work.          
I'm willing to try anything at this point.
Yes! That is the kind of enthusiasm I like to hear.  
Come one, come all and witness the amazing airbenders!  An airbending show that will leave you  breathless  with wind! First up, the tattooed master himself. You know him as the son of Avatar Aang.  He shaves every hair on his head, every single day.  It's the one, the only guy with an arrow pointing to his nose-  Tenzin!             
Now, now,  ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, please be quiet.  I have some serious news. We've heard that an escaped firebending convict has been spotted near here.  Now, I don't want to panic anyone,  but if you see a firebender  with a red scarf...       
I am the escaped convict, and you will all reap my fire. 
Oh, no, who will help us?           
I will!  With my airbending skills.      
Whoa! Aah! Oh! Aah! Aah! Hey! Let me go!  This is not what we rehearsed! Korra!         
With the power of airbending, even this beast can float like a feather!  Look what can be done in only a few short weeks of practice.  No, no, don't worry, folks, she might be young, but she is in full control. 
Ladies and gentlemen, if you or anyone you know is an airbender,  please send them our way. Master Tenzin and Avatar Korra would love to teach them all they know.     
Hey. Hello. If you're looking for airbenders, you just found one.  I want to join you guys.   
Get outta town!           
We got our first recruit.   
Just to be totally clear, we're going to be heading to Ba Sing Se,  then the Northern Air Temple to live as nomads and rebuild the Air Nation. All that sound good to you?   
Yeah, Ba Sing Se, rebuild the temple, Air Nomad whaddyado- I'm in. Let's go right now.       
This is going to be so great! You are gonna love it-  Uh, ah- Real quick, what's your name?  
Kai.  So when do we hit the road?               
Hang on a second, Kai. Where are your parents?  We can't have you come with us without their permission.       
My parents are...  gone.  
You're an orphan?       
It happened about a year ago. My hometown was raided by outlaws, but my parents fought back against them.  I was so scared, but they told me not to worry. They would protect me. And they did. My parents saved me and the entire village, but they died in the fight.  Mom and Pop meant everything to me. They were my whole life.    
Ever since then, I've been on my own and on the run. Those same outlaws are still after me.       
Well, you don't have to be on the run anymore. Right, guys? Tell him.               
I'm so sorry about your parents. I know we could never replace them,  but we're here for you.     
We'll keep you safe.  Come on. 
When you board this airship, you're gonna leave your old life behind and start a new path. That's some big brother advice.  Just think of me as your big brother.      
Guys, I think we got trouble. 
Release the boy  or we'll take him by force.   
The outlaws- they're after me.  L-let's get out of here!     
We're not running from anyone. 
If you want Kai, you'll have to go through me!  
Your days of harassing an innocent boy are over.  You outlaws are going to prison.
Outlaws? Innocent boy?  I'm a sheriff and these are my deputies.  And this kid is a thief.  Whatever he told you is a lie. We've been chasing him for months.           
Where's Kai?         
Right here.  I found him slipping away.      
I was going to the bathroom. 
With your sack of gold?       
I told you, I found that on the road!
Enough with the lies, kid. I want the truth.           
The truth is, he's the outlaw.  He spent his entire life as an orphan until  he got adopted by a real nice family about six months ago.  And how did he repay them? By taking their entire life savings.  We've been after him ever since.           
Is that true?         
The person who stole that stuff was the old me. Once I got airbending,  I changed. I don't know how to explain it,  but I feel like airbending chose me for a reason. Like I'm a new person. I'm sorry!  Please! You have to listen to me.       
Are you taking him back to the orphanage?           
No. He's headed to jail.      
Wait!  You guys  got the family's life savings back. Now let us take Kai.      
Do you really want our first new member of the Air Nation to be a liar and a thief?       
He just needs some guidance, Tenzin. And who better to give it to him than us?         
Do you want this kid or not? 
Yes.  You can release the boy into our custody.       
Thank you.          
Don't make me regret it.      
Welcome to the family, little bro.          
I just want you to know, I'm going to be watching you, kid. I know exactly what you're all about because I've been there before. You don't have me fooled.       
Whoa, hey, lighten up.  I'm turning over a new leaf. Making a change.  Don't you worry about me.     
Hi, I'm Jinora.  If you need any help with airbending I could show you what I know.  
Thanks.  That's real nice of you.    
Jinora!  We're leaving now.          
What's up with the coat? And where did you get that pie?               
It's a Varrick ship, you never know what you're gonna find. There's a whole level filled with funhouse mirrors. Of course...  there's also the cat-gator deck.  I miss that guy, he really knew how to make a long trip interesting. So have you told Korra yet  about how you guys broke up and then you kind of started dating Asami  while she was off getting attacked by dark spirits?        
You wanna keep it down?  I'm waiting for the right moment.      
Oh, Mako.  You know, a wise man once told me that delivering bad news to a girlfriend  was like ripping off a blood-sucking leech. You just have to do it fast and get it over with.      
I hate it when you listen to me. Fine.              
Unalaq will be waiting for you. You'll need all of your Avatar power to stop him. 
I'm going to close the spirit portals, lock Vaatu in for another 10,000 years,  and make Unalaq wish he'd never been born!      
Thanks, Mako.          
Uh... Um...          
Did you want something?       
Uh,  no, no, nothing.     
As soon as we reach the Southern Water Tribe, we'll blast through the blockade at the main port. Then we can rendezvous with Tonraq and his troops, crash through the defenses around the portal, and enter the Spirit World.   
Whoa, since when does my little brother want to crash or blast through anything?           
I'll do whatever it takes to save my daughter.      
We all want to save Jinora, but I think your plan might be a tad overaggressive, seeing as there are only seven of us and one ship. 
Really? And what do you suggest?    
An attack like this calls for strategy.  I remember when I was surrounded by pirates in the Hurricane Straits. We managed to capture them all with just a feather, two eggs, and a barrel of molasses.       
I don't want to hear any of your crazy stories now! This is serious.        
Are we almost there?     
Almost. But, I just picked up a distress signal from the Southern troops, there's a problem.          
Mom!             
I'm so happy you're here.   
Where's Dad?         
Unalaq wiped out the entire Southern resistance and captured your father.       
I'll get him back.      
Where is my mother?      
She's in the healing hut. So many injured.        
What happened?        
Her soul is trapped in the Spirit World.      
Oh, my goodness. How long has she been away?   
Almost a week. I've tried to keep her energy flowing, but I can feel her slipping away.  You're the only one who can help her now, Mom.      
How much longer can she survive like this?      
I don't know. But she's very strong to have lasted this long.       
I talked to the rebels, they said Unalaq's got the Southern portal surrounded. Harmonic Convergence is only a few hours away.       
Then we have to break through the enemy lines ourselves and get to the portal now.      
There's no use in talking anymore. We know what our mission is.  
A suicide mission.      
You know, I was in a similar situation once. My platoon had crawled through the desert with no water for a week, but when we finally located the only oasis for 100 miles, it was surrounded by angry sandbenders.  I realized our only chance to get to the water was to drop in from above.  So I fashioned together a catapult, and with the help of a few well-trained hog-monkeys-
Enough of your ridiculous lies! Can't you see that the fate of the world and Jinora's life depends on what we do here today?       
Hold on, maybe Bumi's right. We don't have a catapult and hog-monkeys, but we have a flying bison, and there's a plane on Varrick's ship. Maybe we can attack from above.           
What are you thinking?    
Mako, Bolin, and I can use the plane to create a distraction and scatter some of the defenses. You, Tenzin, Bumi, and Kya can fly into the spirit portal on Oogi when you see an opening.    
Let's get moving.       
What are we still doing here, father?             
The invasion was completely successful, and the Southern Tribe is under our control. The spirit portals are open.  
You've restored balance, now we would like to go home.    
You don't understand. Everything I've achieved so far will pale in comparison with what I'm about to accomplish.    
What else is there? The Water Tribe is united.      
After today, there will be no more Water Tribe, no more nations of any kind. The world is about to be transformed into something magnificent and new. And I will lead this glorious revolution.  Now go outside and get the troops ready to defend the spirit portal.  
From whom? We've already beaten everyone. 
The Avatar will be here soon.  She has no choice.          
Are you ready?        
I'm an earthbender strapped to the wing of a plane hundreds of feet in the air, so, no?             
Don't worry. There's no way they'll be expecting this.      
I think they were expecting it!     
Ahhh!!! Asamiii!             
Get ready!         
Fire!              
There are spirits everywhere. I don't see an opening.     
Let's circle around and see if we can find a way from the other side. 
Hold on!            
The spirits are weighing Oogi down, we're losing altitude.     
Get off of him, you sticky, nasty, little blob of goo!  Whoa! If I go, you're coming with me.  Aah!   
Bumi!             
I wish Varrick was filming this.  We could call it "Nuktuk: Sky Warrior"!      
Brace yourselves!       
Dad.              
Korra, I'm so sorry. I failed you.          
Don't give up. Harmonic Convergence isn't here yet, we still have a chance.     
We tried.           
Congratulations, everyone. You've all got front-row seats for the beginning of the new world order.     
You don't know what you're doing, Unalaq. Freeing Vaatu won't make you powerful, it will only make you a traitor to everything good that's happened for the last 10,000 years.      
You think what Avatar Wan did was good?  Driving almost all the spirits from this world? The Avatar hasn't brought balance, only chaos.  You call yourself the bridge between the two worlds, but there shouldn't be a bridge, we should live together as one.             
Even if Vaatu escapes, I'll put him right back in his prison, just like Wan did.          
It's true that when Wan fused with Raava, he tipped the scales in her favor. But this time, I'll be here to level the playing field. When Harmonic Convergence comes, I will fuse with Vaatu.  And together, we will become the new Avatar. A Dark Avatar. Your era is over.           
Think about what you're doing. I know that you've always had a deep connection with the spirits, but you're still a man. You're still my brother. You're Eska and Desna's father. Are you willing to throw your humanity away to become a monster?      
I'll be no more of a monster than your own daughter. The only difference is that while she can barely recognize her own spiritual power, I will be in complete alignment with mine. Vaatu and I will be as one.  No one will be able to stand against us.  Keep them locked up.  After the Harmonic Convergence, I will come for Korra.     
Yes, father.         
I failed in every way. We've lost Jinora forever.      
There's still a chance. They didn't get Bumi.      
Oh, you want to play some more. Well, bring it on.          
Oh, we're playing dirty, huh?  
Hmm, looks like we've got a music lover here.       
Reinforcements!
All right, soldiers. Looks like it's on us to save the day. Luckily, I've got a plan.       
Eska, Desna, listen to me.
You've got to help us stop Unalaq. I know he's your father, but Vaatu has made him completely crazy.           
We will never turn on our father.         
Please, if you let me out now, I can still stop him from destroying everything. Once he fuses with Vaatu, no one will be safe. Desna, he won't be your father anymore.      
You don't know what you're talking about! Our father is the wisest man in the world, if he says what he is doing is right, I believe him.         
All right, spirit army,  your general is here. Follow me! 
It's working!                                      
It's not working!           
Get me out of here!       
Whoo-hoo!               
All right, guys. Rescue time!          
Bumi, how did you manage to take out this entire encampment on your own?          
I did it all with my trusty flute and-  Oh, never mind. You wouldn't believe it anyway.  Let's get moving.           
You run into the portal. I'll try to hold off anyone who comes after you.      
No, you're too hurt. You need a healer.  Asami, can you take Oogi and my Dad back to my Mom?      
Mm-hmm.               
This is my fight now.     
Korra, I love you.           
I love you too, Dad.     
Yip-yip.              
Once we're inside, you go find Jinora.  Mako and Bolin will take care of Unalaq while I close the portal, so Vaatu can't escape.   
Wait a second.  Worst-case scenario: So we're fighting Unalaq, you close the portals, and let's just say something happens to you, are we gonna be trapped in there for eternity?     
If everything goes as planned, we'll all walk out together after Harmonic Convergence.  If not...                        
Let's go.               
Tenzin, go find Jinora!       
Come on!              
You're running out of time, Raava. I know you feel it coming.      
Raava, nothing could stop this moment. Harmonic Convergence is upon us again.
I'm not going to let you fuse with Unalaq. You're going right back in that prison.
Don't let Unalaq back in the Spirit World!
We're on it!
Jinora... Jinora's spirit, do you hear me? It's your Uncle Bumi.
Ah, this isn't working. We can't just randomly wander the Spirit World, call out for Jinora, and expect to find her!
We just need to employ the simple rules of tracking.  First we locate her footprints... then we follow them.
Do you even know what Spirit footprints look like? Do spirits even leave footprints? Face it, your tracking skills won't work in the Spirit World.  Let me try something.  Ommmm...  Jinora is over there. I feel a lot of spiritual energy coming from that direction.
We're in the Spirit World, there's spiritual energy in every direction!
Enough! We can't do this by ourselves, we need a spirit guide.  There!  Spirit, hello. I'm sorry to disturb you, but I am in need of your assistance.
Well, that didn't work. Now where are we?
We're completely lost.
No!
Huh?
I don't know if we can win this fight.
We don't need to win. We just need to stop Unalaq from getting back in the Spirit World. Huh?
We're walking in circles! I've seen that same Spirit Mushroom five times! 
That's not the same mushroom.
See? Even it knows we're lost.
Oh, sure, listen to a fungus over your own brother.
What's that?
Mushroom, is that you?
Iroh?
How...? Where...? It's been so long.
Iroh, we are grateful, but we're not looking for the way out. We're looking for my daughter.
I'm not leaving until I find Jinora.
A place where only the lost can find you... That's it! I know where to find Jinora!
I'm locking you away for another 10,000 years, Vaatu!
Unalaq?  Are you out there? He must have gone home? 
Hello, my feeble turtle-duck.
Aah!
Huh?
Don't let them escape this time.
Are you sure this is the best way to find Jinora?
Trust me.  Hey, you, spirit- Wake up!
I thought we were going to be taken to a prison.
This is a prison.
Stop!
No!
We are now one.
Now a new era for spirits and humans will begin, and I will lead them all as the new Avatar.
Well, I'm the old Avatar, and my era's not over yet.
What kind of prison doesn't have any bars or walls? We could walk right out of here.
The Fog of Lost Souls is a spirit prison for humans. I read about it in an ancient text. The Fog is actually a spirit... that infects your mind and slowly drives you mad, imprisoning you in your own darkest memories.
How long can you be trapped in here?
I am Zhao the Conqueror! I am the moonslayer! I will capture the Avatar! I am Zhao the Conqueror! I am the moonslayer! I will capture the Avatar!
Hopefully we're not trapped in here as long as that guy.
You! You're him! The last airbender! 
Ah! No! Get off me!
You've grown... But I will still defeat you! Ah! Ohh!  Come back, Avatar! Face me! I am Zhao the Conqueror! I will capture you! Victory will be mine!
If we stay together, we'll find Jinora and make it out of this fog.
Give in. Your time is over.
Korra, this fight is not over.
Raava...
Vaatu cannot win. Do not give in to 10,000 years of darkness. You are the Avatar.
You cannot win!
Jinora! Jinora!
Wait a second.
what? Do you hear something?
Yes, they're all around us. The cannibals, they're everywhere.
Bumi, you must focus your mind right now. There are no cannibals.
Yes, there are! They're gonna eat every last one of us!
Aah! Who are you two?!
Kya, we're your brothers. You must remember before the Fog infects you.
No, you are just a vision! I have no family! You can't tie me down!
They're closing in!  I gotta get outta here! Aah!
Aah!
No!  Bumi! Kya! Come back!
Please, let us out.
His groveling is pathetic.
But I do enjoy the sweet scent of desperation.
Come on! Your dad has become an evil monster, he's trying to bring on eternal darkness! Why would you protect someone who doesn't care about you at all?
Father was going to let me expire when we tried to open the Northern portal... Perhaps we should rethink our position.
Yes!
No. Don't listen to him, his words are poisoning your mind.
What's with this outburst of emotion?
I'm sorry, I can't help it. It's just so sad... that I'll never get to be with you again.
What? Explain yourself further.
Eska, I've always loved you, and I've always wanted to be with you... But now that the world is ending, I'm never gonna get that chaaaaaance!
We could have been together, but you left me at the altar.
I was scared! I was scared of my true feelings for you. I should have never left you! I'm sorry! And I'm sorry that we'll never have a chance to rekindle the dying ember that was our love into a... Big fire of love flames!
You'll never defeat my father. But should you survive, perhaps we can spend eternal darkness together.
Wow, that was the best acting I've ever seen. You completely fooled her!
Yeah, right, that- That was acting.
They will certainly perish.
I must stay focused. Remember who you are, Tenzin. You are the son of Avatar Aang. You are the hope for future generations of airbenders. The fate of the world rests on your shoulders.  But what if I fail?  Then your father's hope for the future dies with you.  I can't fail!  You will.  Aah! Stop it! I am the son of Avatar Aang. I am the hope for future generations of airbenders. I am the son of Avatar Aang!
Hello, my son. 
Dad, I've failed you. I am no spiritual leader, and I've let the world down. I'll never be the man you were.
You are right. You are trying to hold on to a false perception of yourself. You are not me, and you should not be me. You are Tenzin.
I am not a reflection of my father. I am Tenzin.  I am Tenzin. 
Jinora!
Ah... What happened?
I think our brother saved us.
Dad. 
You're going to be okay, sweetie. I'm here.
What happened? The last thing I remember is dark spirits taking me away.
You were trapped in The Fog of Lost Souls, but I wasn't going to let you stay there.
I'm so happy to see you, Dad.
Korra!
He's got the light spirit!
The world's in trouble.
What are you talking about? How do you know?
I can feel it.
What happened?
It's Korra.  This light spirit will guide you out of the spirit world.  I have to go help. 
Jinora, wait!
Now... 10,000 years of darkness begins!
Dad's back!          
Where's Jinora?           
No!               
Her spirit is trapped in the Spirit World, but she's going to be all right.        
How could this happen?    
It was all my fault. I should have never let Jinora enter the Spirit World without me, I couldn't protect her.     
I'm so sorry, Pema. I tried to save her, but Unalaq tricked me.     
Don't worry, honey, I'm not going to stop until our little girl is back safe with us.      
Hey, Mako.          
Hey. What's with the fancy duds?   
I'm on my way to the big finale for "Nuktuk: Hero of the South." Yeah, everyone's gonna be there, except for, you know, you... because you're in jail and stuff.              
Thanks for the reminder.      
Hey, I brought you something. I thought this would brighten up your new place.  Read the inscription.      
"Dear Mako, Nuktuk says, 'Keep smiling'."  Did you come by just to give me a poster?       
No. I came by to give you my sincere, heartfelt words of encouragement. I know our lives have been moving in two different directions, but I want you to know that I will always be there for you. We are brothers, after all, even if one of us is a member of high society and the other one is a criminal.         
I am not a criminal!     
Of course I know that, but you do kinda look like one, 'cause you're in a jail, and that's where criminals live.
I was set up! Varrick knew I had figured out he was hiring gangsters to pose as Northern soldiers to get Republic City to join the war. That's why he had me arrested. 
Ah, I see what you're doing. You're going for the insanity defense. Smart.             
No! I'm trying to tell you that Varrick isn't what he seems. Where's Asami? She'll listen to me.      
I asked her to come, but she said it was too hard for her. You being in jail like this reminds her of her dad. Okay, gotta run, but I'll be back tomorrow. And I am gonna get you the best attorney fame and fortune can buy. 
Bolin, wait. If my theory about Varrick is right, something might go down tonight at your premiere. Promise me you'll keep your eyes peeled.     
Yeah, okay, big brother. I promise.  Whew! That insanity defense is definitely gonna work.       
We can't wait any longer.  It's time we take back what is ours! It's time to take back our city!               
Say "Nuktuk."         
Let me get a picture.           
Wow, that was fun. And did you hear what Shiro said? We're Republic City's most famous couple.       
Bolin, you're a doll, but you're as dumb as the rocks you bend. We are not a couple. 
That's not what Shiro said.  
Stop stuffing your moustaches with Varri-cakes and get to your post!      
You got it, boss. 
You two are the pinnacle of refinement.         
There they are, my two most honored guests.  What do you think? No expense has been spared.  I brought in the finest entertainers from Ba Sing Se and the best food from around the world. Heck, I even had this red carpet imported from the Fire Nation. They make the best red stuff over there. Fact. All right, picture time!    
Varrick, you didn't have to do all this for us.   
I wanted to. Mr. President, I took one look at your wife, and I knew that you were a man of exquisite taste.  And that's why I know you're gonna love this mover!  
Varrick, I know what you're doing, and I doubt your propaganda is going to change my mind about going to war with the Northern Water Tribe. 
Oh, I think you'll be surprised how persuasive I can be.  
Thank you all for coming to the finale of "Nuktuk: Hero of the South". You know, when I first started this project, there were a lot of naysayers out there. "You can't make pictures move," they said. "You can't take some knucklehead earthbender and make him a star," they said.  "You can't teach a polar bear dog to speak," they said. Well, they're wrong. Thanks to the magic of the movers, our furry friends have found their voices, and you'll be shocked to hear what they have to say. They speak of the injustice that's happening in the Southern Water Tribe right now.  My hope is that their words and this epic mover will inspire a real-life hero to rise up and help.  Thank you again, enjoy the show! 
Thank you, wise sage. I will travel to Republic City and seek help.
Mr. President, there's something more important than the sniffles right now. I need your help to stop the Evil Unalaq.    
The seal-lion seemed a bit far-fetched, but the portrayal of this president is right on the money.     
I think this is your best mover yet.     
I just wish Mako was here to see it.
Mmm. I like to eat the top off the Varri-cake first.       
I just try to shove the whole thing in my mouth at once. 
I love our job. Huh? 
Northern Water Tribe Automatons! Nooo!              
Bee bo bop, Nuktuk cannot stop Unalaq. Must destroy Nuktuk.      
Ha ha! Aah!  Looks like you forgot that water and Automatons don't mix.              
Beep bop boo. Oh, no, circuits not working.      
We did it!  But wait, where's Juji?          
You can't die, Juji. Not on my watch.        
It's okay, Nuktuk. At least I got to be... Your friend. 
Juji! 
Are you okay? It seems like this mover is really getting to you. You do know Juji's not really dead?        
Of course I know. Juji's fine. He comes back to life in the end when the doomsday device shifts the polarity of the Earth. Oops. Spoiler. Sorry.             
Then what's wrong?      
I guess I just miss my friends. Everything is going so well for me, but it feels empty without everyone around. Korra's gone, Mako's in jail, you're doing... business lady stuff. Team Avatar's fallen apart.   
I know, things have changed so much since we first met. Why don't you come back in and finish watching the mover with me?          
You go ahead. I need another minute.     
That's weird.         
Whoa- ahh! Ugh!              
They're after the President! 
I don't think so!  
Mr. President, get back! I'm here to help. 
Looks like there's nowhere to go.         
Secure the President and call for backup immediately!          
Bolin, look out!  
Tell me who sent you!     
It was Varrick. Please don't hurt me, Nuktuk!
I think this is our cue to exit.       
Where do you think you're going?          
They're falling back!
Varrick's plan was to kidnap you and blame it on the North. Then Republic City would have no choice but to join the war on the side of the South.   
I can't believe Varrick would do something like this, and no one saw it coming.       
Actually, someone did. Remember Mako?         
You've got a great officer on your hands.         
He's one of the best.     
I can't believe my boyfriend is a real-life hero!      
Boyfriend? Wait, stop. I thought you said we weren't a couple.      
Ah, you really are as dumb as those rocks.  Of course we're a couple. 
Bolin, you saved the President and you proved Mako was right all along. We have to go tell him what happened.         
Yeah!       
Ahem.      
Oh, you meant right now.      
President Raiko...      
Avatar Korra, what's wrong?  
Sir, I know I've asked for your help before, but things have changed. Unalaq doesn't just want to take over the South anymore, he wants to destroy the whole world.       
Unalaq is gonna destroy the world? He really does have a doomsday device?          
He's trying to release a powerful dark spirit during Harmonic Convergence, which is only a few days away. If he succeeds, the world as we know it is over. Sir, we desperately need your help.         
I'm sorry, Korra, but my answer is still no.
There are lives on the line! And my daughter is one of them. Raiko, you must reconsider!   
I'm aware that lives are on the line, and that's precisely why my troops are staying here. If the world is going to be thrown into chaos, like you claim, I need to protect my citizens. I'm sorry.     
Sir... Nuktuk needs your help. I know you love helping people. 
Son, I appreciate you saving my life, and I'm a big fan of your work, but my decision is final.               
I never should have saved that guy.    
If you guys need help, I'm here for you.           
Yeah, me too.         
Thank you. It's so good to see you guys again.  Wait, where's Mako?       
So, how was the big premiere?           
I saved the President! In real life!          
Wait, w-what?          
You were right about Varrick, he tried to kidnap Raiko!       
I knew it!          
But it didn't work, because of you and because of me. Let's just say we both did good. Bei Fong says you're free to go.  Sorry for ever doubting you, Mako.       
Don't worry about it, bro.  
Nice job, Mako. You're going to make a great detective.          
But, Chief, there aren't any detective openings right now.  
Actually, we have two openings.      
Mako, I missed you so much.      
Oh, yeah, did I forget to tell you? Korra's back.          
Korra, hey, I missed you too. So you're not still mad at me?        
Why would I be mad?      
We had that fight before you left, remember?      
No, not really. I got attacked by a dark spirit, and I lost my memory for a little while. Maybe it hasn't all come back yet. Was it a bad fight?       
Uh... Mm...  No. No, it- it wasn't that bad.       
Korra, we don't have much time. We need to figure out how to deal with Unalaq.    
I think I know just the man to talk to.    
Guys, hey! What do you think?  Varrick Industries built this prison, and I had this cell made special. I had a feeling I'd end up here one day.  Zhu Li, come on! We got guests, whip up a pot of that green tea I love.       
Zhu Li's in prison with you?               
Of course. I don't go anywhere without my assistant. Do you?             
We're not interested in your tea, and this isn't a friendly visit.           
Don't tell me you guys are still mad about everything that happened. I did some good things too. Korra, who warned you about Unalaq? I did. Bolin, who got you into the movers? I did. Asami, who saved your company? I did. Mako, who got you thrown in jail? I did! Oh, yeah, I guess that was a bad thing.      
You stole everything from me, and you tried to kidnap the President. Those are pretty bad too.       
I wasn't going to hurt him. I just needed to start a war. Well, a bigger war.       
Well, we're gonna end it. Where's all the stuff you stole from Asami?      
The Future Industries stuff? It's on my battleship.     
You have a battleship?    
Of course I do! I bought the first one they made, named her the Zhu Li.      
You named your battleship after your assistant?      
Yep. They're both cold, heartless war machines.     
Look, I am truly sorry for the mess I caused. Let me make it up to you, take Zhu Li.  My battleship, it's yours, and everything on it.      
It's not the fleet we were looking for, but it's the next best thing.  
All right! Team Avatar is back In business!          
It's okay. We're gonna stop Unalaq and get Jinora back.      
I hope my Dad's all right.  
I'm sure he's fine.      
Get the men and fall back.      
What about you?           
I'm going to end this right now. Go!               
Hello, Tonraq. Looking for me?         
Brother, I'm too strong for you.     
You're no brother of mine. You betrayed me. You had me banished!      
Yes, I did.          
Stop! He's mine.              
You are not the true Chief.         
I am, and you will bow to me.     
Now that I've defeated you, your daughter is next.     
I can't believe my little girl had to guide Korra into the Spirit World instead of me.
She's very smart, and she obviously has a strong connection to the spirits. She'll be fine.         
Yeah, Dad went all the time.          
They won't have their bending in there. They'll be defenseless.      
Ahem. Excuse me, but I've never had bending, And I don't think I'd call myself "defenseless." 
Of course you aren't, because you have your, um...          
Positive attitude?      
I would have said acute intellect and catlike reflexes,  but whatever.          
Why don't you two get some sleep? I'll take the first watch.        
Wake us up if you need some company.       
Or if any interesting spirity stuff happens,  like their bodies start floating around and you need someone to  help you grab them before they fly off.      
Bumi!             
I'm just saying we're here if you need us. 
I know you are. Thank you.  Please come back soon.       
Isn't it beautiful?      
Just stick close to me, okay? This seems nice, but you never know when we'll run into some dark spirits.  Huh!              
Look. It's like it's made of jewels. The spirits are so much more beautiful in their own world than they are at home. 
Jinora, be careful! Hold on!            
Sorry.            
I'm the Avatar.           
I'm trying to find the spirit portals? I opened one-         
No, I did, but-          
B-b-because I was at the South Pole.          
Get away from me!       
Jinora!             
Korra, stay calm! Your energy is upsetting them.  You're only making it worse.                    
Jinora!               
Jinora? Jinora!                          
Ah! 
Jinora! 
Korra! Where are you? Hello? I'm lost. Can anyone help me? 
Furry-Foot, is that you?  It's so good to see you again! You're so big here.  I don't suppose you know where Korra is, do you? We were supposed to go find the spirit portals, but I don't know how to find anything down here. 
It's like an awesome tree house!  Wait, I read about this place. Grandpa Aang came here. It's Wan Shi Tong's spirit library!         
Complete opposites? I know!             
I tried to fight it, but she really grew on me.             
Wow. I could just stay in here forever, reading.           
Professor Zei!        
I thought anyone could come in if they brought you some new knowledge.       
Well, since you've been down in the Spirit World, the humans have invented radio.         
But do you know how it works?          
Actually, when we speak, our voices produce sound waves. Radio takes those sound waves and converts them into electromagnetic energy that is transmitted through the spectrum-     
My grandfather was the Avatar, and I came to the Spirit World with the new Avatar to find the spirit portals. I would think that you'd wanna help me.       
Come on, Furry-Foot! We gotta hurry!         
Did you say something to her?             
Me? You're the one with the big mouth.       
Ugh, it's not in here either. I have to find the portals, Korra's probably waiting for me there right now.  I need to find a map that shows where the spirit portals are. Could you help me?          
Thanks, this is it.  The Tree of Time. That's where Avatar Wan imprisoned Vaatu.  "The elders believed that as long as the portals are closed during the Harmonic Convergence, Vaatu will remain imprisoned and the battle between good and evil will not be fought again."  But if both portals are opened, spirit energy is amplified greatly.  During the Harmonic Convergence,  this energy will be great enough to allow Vaatu to break free from his bonds,  and the Material World will again risk being consumed by darkness."  We have to warn Korra.     
Leaving so soon?
When Wan Shi Tong told me he had a visitor, I had to see it with my own eyes.  I can't believe Tenzin sent his daughter here instead of coming himself. What kind of a father is he?             
Better than you. Wan Shi Tong, how can you be helping him?   
Why would you wanna help Vaatu escape? He'll destroy everything.       
Don't believe everything you read.  Why don't you come with me so you can do some first-hand research?       
Furry-Foot?           
All right, now let's close that portal and go find Jinora.       
That's where Vaatu is.     
So you've returned, Raava.
I think you've said that before, Vaatu, but I'm here to close the portal. You're not getting out.    
You might want to reconsider. That is, if you want to save your friend.      
Jinora. 
I can't believe I trusted you. You made me think you wanted to restore balance with the spirits but this, this isn't balance, it's madness. Now let her go.         
If you want your friend to make it out of the Spirit World, you'll open the other portal now.      
Don't do it, Korra!      
What will it be? Open the portal,  or lose your friend's soul forever?                    
Stop.  I'll do it.            
Now let Jinora go.
Ah!               
You should have come through the portal, then you could do this.     
Korra!             
I'll see you soon, Raava.  Once the Harmonic Convergence comes,  I'll be free from this prison. And then I will have my revenge.                     
Korra. What was it like? Did you manage to close the portal? Was Jinora able to help you?          
Tenzin, I'm- I'm sorry.              
Where's Jinora? W-why isn't she waking up?
Korra, what happened to my little girl?          
Gotcha!  Furry-Foot, come back.     
Jinora, there you are. Come on, everyone's waiting.  Were you playing with someone? 
Oh, just some... imaginary friends.
Stop telling lies.      
It's true! I once beat an earthbender in a rock-throwing contest! I have the trophy to prove it. 
All right, who's ready for an exciting tour of the Eastern Air Temple? We've got a lot to see today; Including ancient statues, ancient gardens, and the meditation hall used by ancient airbenders.   
Yay. Old things.           
Korra?            
What are you doing here?      
And how did you know where to find us?           
Tenzin's itinerary. We went over it like a hundred times before we left Republic City.  
See? This is why schedules are important.    
It's so great to see you all again.      
It's great to see you too, but why aren't you training at the South Pole?          
Wait, you don't know about the civil war?      
What? No. We've been out of touch with the outside world since we started our vacation. 
Tenzin's idea. What happened?         
So much. I don't know where to start.  
Just tell us everything!      
Everything? Okay.  I opened a spirit portal at the South Pole, but then Unalaq turned out to be bad guy and wanted to take control of the South. So I sort of started a civil war, but when I went to find some help, I was attacked by my cousins and then by a giant, dark spirit, and then I forgot who I was, and then I met the first Avatar, and then I realized I shouldn't have opened the portal in the first place, and now I need to close it again!         
I knew this would happen.  So Avatar Wan imprisoned this dark spirit Vaatu in the Spirit World?      
Yes, and now I think my uncle is trying to free him.     
I knew Unalaq was hungry for power but never realized how far he would go to get it. 
This is all my fault.     
No, don't blame yourself. This is Unalaq's doing. Now, we must focus on setting things right before he can do any more damage.        
Thank you.          
So you need to close the Southern portal, but if Unalaq's army controls the South, how are we going to get to it? 
I thought about that. My best chance to close the portal is from the inside. I have to enter the Spirit World.           
A journey to the Spirit World. All my years of spiritual training have prepared me for this moment.  I will help you. Today, we enter the Spirit World.           
Father, what are we doing here?     
You're here to straighten out the mess you caused when you failed to capture the Avatar.     
I told you, it wasn't our fault.      
We'll make it up to you, father.             
Good, because I'll need your help to open the Northern portal.  
I thought only the Avatar could do it.     
I believe there is another way.      
This way.  There it is: The Northern portal.      
Hello? Anyone? Nuktuk's still up here, all alone.  Asami! Hey, what are you doing here?  
Varrick invited me to watch some of the filming. Are you filming right now?      
Right now? Nope. We're, uh... We're at lunch.         
Asami, there you are. Is Bolin around?        
Up here. 
Good. I've got something to tell you both.           
Ow. I got to stop doing my own stunts.         
I found out who's been stealing from Future Industries: Varrick.            
What? No.               
He attacked his own ship?   
Yes! It was a ploy. He wants Republic City to go to war, and he wants control of the businesses that stand to profit the most from it. He already had all the shipping. All he needed was Future Industries.     
Varrick helped save Future Industries. He's my business partner now, not an evil mastermind. Mako, you seem stressed.    
I am stressed!        
See, this is why I had to move out.          
You guys aren't living together anymore?    
Nope. It was time for this eagle-hawk to spread his wings and fly.            
Sounds like you've had a pretty busy week.  Maybe you just need to relax.  
Wait a minute. Are you two-  You're dating again! What?!              
Dating? No!               
That's crazy!         
Korra just left a week ago!  
Guys, listen to me. Varrick is up to no good, and I have proof. The detonators he uses in his movers are exactly like the one I found at the Cultural Center attack. And those explosions were exactly like the ones the captain reported when Asami's shipment was hijacked. Don't you see?         
Anyone could have gotten their hands on one of those detonators.           
Yeah. Let it go, Mako. Let it go.              
Uh, no! I'm not going to let it go!   
You're lucky. This temple is the most spiritual of all the air temples. Why, this very garden is where my father met Guru Pathik.      
Wow! Spirit World, here we come.   
Are you in the Spirit World? 
I would be if Meelo could ring his bell at the appropriate intervals.  
Aww, did I do it wrong?       
Let's try something else.   
I thought your bell ringing was just fine.         
Thanks!               
Kya, this is too much smoke. You set it up wrong. This isn't going to work.       
I'm sorry, I did what you told me.     
Well, the moment's ruined.
We could have tried a little longer.
Come back, Furry-Foot!    
Hey, Jinora, what are you chasing?      
Nothing.              
Focus, Korra. Focus.             
I am focusing.        
No talking. Feel the energy of the universe.
Okay, I feel it.          
Korra, really! I'm trying to concentrate here!  I don't think this location is going to work either.    
What's going on with you? First, you're blaming Meelo, then Kya, and now me.      
Well, nothing is feeling right to me.      
I don't want to rush your feelings, but we're kind of in a hurry. How did you first get into the Spirit World? Let's try that.         
Well... Actually, I've never been into the Spirit World.    
You've never been into the Spirit world?     
But you used to spend days in the temple meditating.       
Trying to get in. It never happened. It's my greatest shortcoming as an airbender, spiritual leader, and son of Aang.        
Welcome to the "I Disappoint Dad" club.  
If you've never been to the Spirit World, how were you planning to get Korra into it?      
I've spent years studying the techniques and theories of ancient spiritual leaders. Now that the Avatar needs me, it must be my time.       
Tenzin, Harmonic Convergence is almost here. If Vaatu escapes from the Spirit World-     
You have to trust me. I can help you.         
There might be another way.  Jinora, is there something you want to tell Korra?    
Jinora? She is too young and untrained to have any knowledge about spiritual matters.    
Actually, I think I do know where Korra needs to go to get into the spirit world.  
And how would you know that? 
My spirit friends showed me. It's okay. You can show yourselves.    
How did you do that? 
Jinora...               
Bunnies!              
Actually, they're dragonfly-bunny spirits.    
I knew it. Looks like she does know something about spiritual matters. 
So cute.              
Bunnies!              
Come back!              
How long have you been able to do this?           
I don't know. I guess I've always kind of had a connection with spirits.   
I think this one likes me.      
Are they here to help?    
I think they want you to go down there.           
I don't know. The spiritual energy is historically strongest near the temple.        
No offense, but I'm guessing the spirits have actually been to the Spirit World, so I'm gonna follow them.       
If we need to go to the Tenzin World, we'll call you.         
Father, haven't the spirits had 10,000 years to open this portal?      
If they could not succeed, what makes you think we will?  
By entering the Spirit World through the portal, we bring with us something the spirits never had: Our bending.  Join me! Together we can open this portal.           
Desna!            
Leave him. Keep bending!          
He needs a healer at once!  
This is more important!       
I'm taking him back.          
I hear you've got some ideas. You wanna tell me about them?  
Go ahead. Torture me all you want. I'm not gonna talk.       
Torture? The only thing I want to torture is this pesky foot fungus.  Ooh! Ah! Eee! Ooh! The burning means it's working.  I heard you've been investigating the recent attacks on my ships, and I think you know that I know that you know, you know?    
Know what?          
That the world is a dangerous place, and that's exactly why I want to offer you a job on my security force.   
I have a job.         
We need you.  Me, Asami, Bolin. We're all on the same team here. We want you to join us. You wouldn't want anything to happen to Asami, would you? I mean, I heard you and her were kind of an item again? Or what about your brother?   
What are you saying?     
I'm saying I want your help to protect them. Without you, who knows what could happen?    
Thanks for your concern,  but the answer is no.      
Oh, you are just so cute. I'm going to name you Bum-Ju. It's short for "Bumi Junior." Don't you think he looks like me?           
The resemblance is uncanny.  
I think Dad's mad at me.      
Your father's not mad. His pride's just a little bruised since he isn't able to see spirits like you.    
You have a natural gift. That's pretty lucky.      
You're the lucky one.You actually got to meet the first Avatar. I know about a lot of Avatars, but I don't know anything about him. Is it even a him, or is it a her?         
It's a him, Avatar Wan. He was amazing. I saw how he became the first Avatar by fusing with Raava, the Spirit of Light.      
The Avatar is part spirit? Of course! Just like the statue!      
What statue?         
When we were at the Southern Air Temple, I was drawn to this old carving. I couldn't figure out what it was until now. It was the first Avatar.    
When did this happen?     
It was on the solstice.       
That's the day I opened the Southern portal.    
We're here!          
Are you sure these spirits are leading us to the right place?       
Of course! I trust Bum-Ju with my life.  
Look! There are carvings on them.  
This is an ancient airbender meditation circle.          
There's a lot of spiritual energy in this place, but it feels really strange.  
We'll have to perform a spiritual cleansing ceremony.   
What are you talking about?  
Dad taught it to me. This site has been neglected for many years. A cleansing ceremony will help strengthen its connection to the Spirit World.      
Good job, you cleansed the area of the only spirits that want to help us, and you scared away Bum-Ju.   
It's working.         
Ah! Bats! Evil bats!              
Not bats, dark spirits!          
What are we supposed to do?  
Amazing.              
Your spiritual training has come a long way.      
Unalaq may be a horrible person, but his spirit powers are no joke.          
He taught you how to transform dark spirits. I can't even get you into the Spirit World.     
Everything Unalaq taught me was to help himself. Everything you've done was meant to help me. I am so sorry for turning my back on you as my mentor. I need you now more than ever. 
I won't let you down.  The ancient airbenders must have built this site. If we meditate here, we'll be able to enter the Spirit World.      
Why don't you go first?       
After all these years, my father's dream for me will finally come true.     
Hi. 
Did you come by to tell me how paranoid I am?          
No. I just wanted to come by to make sure you're okay. You seemed so agitated earlier. 
I'm fine.           
Maybe you need a night off. Why don't we go get some dinner?
No, thanks. I'm a little busy.          
Too busy for Kuang's cuisine? Remember?  We had our first date there.  
Maybe I do need to get my mind off things. 
Police!  Hey, May-ko. Hope we didn't interrupt you two lovebirds. 
What's going on?          
We busted some Triple Threats who said you hired them for a job. 
All right. It's true. We were trying to figure out who stole Asami's stuff, so we hired them for a sting operation. I'm sorry for going behind your back. 
According to the Triple Threats, you did more than that. They said you helped them steal a warehouse full of Future Industries property.   
That's crazy!         
You're gonna believe a bunch of criminals?      
I have to follow up on a lead.
Well, looky what I found: Cash...  And these.              
What are you doing with explosives, Mako?     
I don't know where those came from.     
You're under arrest.     
None of that is mine.     
Sure. Should've known you'd hook up with your old pals. Once a Triple Threat, always a Triple Threat.     
This has to be a mistake. 
Sorry to break the news to you, sweetie, but your boyfriend's just a crooked cop. That sting operation was just a way to lure you away from your warehouse.        
He was using you the whole time.         
That's not true, Asami. I would never do anything to hurt you.  It's Varrick. This is all Varrick. He set me up!          
Yeah, it's Varrick's fault. Varrick. Varrick.            
No, I am not, and stop bugging me! 
It's okay, Tenzin. Maybe you weren't meant to guide Korra into the Spirit World.     
No! Just give me some time.     
Stop being so stubborn. It's not your destiny. I think Jinora was meant to guide the Avatar.           
Jinora will not enter the Spirit World! She's not ready for the dangers of the other side, but I am. I've spent years training, studying, and mastering everything there is to know about the Spirit World.     
Tenzin, we're running out of time.          
If everyone could just be quiet and let me focus! 
Aunt Kya is right. I can guide Korra into the Spirit World. I'll be all right.          
Perhaps I will never have the connection with spirits like I always wanted... Like my father wanted me to have.          
It's okay, Daddy.       
I'm proud of you.  Go. Close the portal. We'll wait here and keep your bodies safe till you return.     
We'll be all right.      
The Spirit World. 
The Avatar is dead, and we cannot open the Northern portal. I have failed you, Vaatu.       
You have not failed me... Yet. The Avatar still lives.     
How do you know?          
Even though my connection to Raava was severed, I can still feel her presence. 
I'll find her.        
The Avatar will find you. She has just entered the Spirit World.           
Should we pull her up?    
No. She is connecting with her deepest Avatar memories. She must confront her own past if she is to move forward.  We can only hope that she survives her ordeal.  
The human and spirit realms are headed toward annihilation, and it's all your fault! This is why humans have no place interfering in the business of spirits.           
This world is home to all of us, and what happens here is everyone's business.     
Thanks to you, this world may cease to exist! I only hope I can track down Vaatu before it's too late.
Let me help you.
I don't want your help. Don't interfere with me again, human!          
Let's get moving. 
Do you see that, Mula? People. And they have some kind of wind power.        
More humans! I found you.          
Aah!             
Wait! I'm friendly!      
Huh?
The legends are true! Another Lion Turtle city. And it's flying!  I have got to get over there.  
There.  Okay, Mula. Wish me luck.  Oh, no-                     
Wow. 
Hi, how are you? I'm Wan. I'm sorry to interrupt, but it's been a while since I've seen other humans.  
Another Lion Turtle city far away. For the past two years, I've been living among the spirits and exploring the wilds.    
Vaatu.            
So we meet again, human.      
Uh, I'll explain later.  Leave these people in peace. They've done nothing to harm you.          
Be gone.  
How are you feeling since our split, Raava? I've never been better. When Harmonic Convergence comes, I will destroy you forever.   
I told you not to interfere! 
I had to do something. These people were in danger.  
Ask him.              
It wasn't my fault. Vaatu tricked me into freeing him. I'd take it all back if I could.           
It's too late for that. Now that Vaatu is free, he is turning other spirits dark. The more spirits he turns, the stronger he becomes.    
He's getting bigger, and you're getting smaller.   
As darkness grows, light fades.          
I'm sorry for endangering your village, but I promise to set things right.      
Great Lion Turtle, I ask that you grant me the power of air so that I can defeat Vaatu before it's too late.      
I'm not like other humans. I can learn to do it.      
Ancient one, why would I do that for a human? Especially one who's caused so much trouble?        
Raava, please, I can't let the world fall into chaos because of my mistake. Neither of us can defeat Vaatu alone, but together we have a chance.           
You may be right. Very well. I will help you to master the power of air.           
Thank you. And in return, I will help you restore balance to the world.          
What's this Harmonic thing Vaatu was talking about?    
Harmonic Convergence. That is when Vaatu and I must battle for the fate of the world.      
How long do we have until then?           
About a year in your time.          
Then we better start training. 
All right, I'm ready to try air. How's this gonna work?
The only way for me to give you the other element is to pass through your body and combine our energies.       
Great. So you've done this before.   
No. This has never even been attempted. It is very dangerous.      
That's what they said about living in the Spirit Wilds, and I survived that. I'm ready. Give me the air. 
It feels completely different. If you and Vaatu have the same fight every 10,000 years, why hasn't one of you destroyed the other? 
He cannot destroy light any more than I can destroy darkness. One cannot exist without the other.  Even if I defeat Vaatu in this encounter, darkness will grow inside me until he emerges again. The same will hold true if Vaatu defeats me.      
That doesn't sound so bad. Even if Vaatu wins, you'll come back.           
Yes, but you will probably not survive to see it. Vaatu will destroy the world as you know it. Darkness will cover the earth for 10,000 years.           
If I'm gonna help you battle Vaatu, then I should visit more lion turtles.          
Why is there so much conflict between humans and spirits in the first place?
This physical world is where humans come from. Spirits come from another realm.  At the North and South poles, the two realms intersect. Over time, more and more spirits have drifted into this world.  Humans have been forced apart, settling on the lion turtles who protect them, and losing touch with each other.        
Most people think they live in the only human city in the world.          
Most humans think only of themselves, no matter how many others are around.   
When you pass through me, I feel an incredible rush of power.  I feel like I'm changing. The more we practice, the stronger I become.  Smells like smoke.          
Humans are nearby.      
Let's check it out.      
A spirit!           
Easy there, fellas. We're friendly.         
I can't believe it. Wan?              
Jaya!  What are you doing out here?  
Ha ha! You inspired us. Once we heard that you survived out in the wilds, we decided to try it too.       
Where's Yao? Did he come with you?      
Yes, but sadly, he didn't make it. We- we lost a lot of good men along the way.  So why were you protecting this spirit?          
This is Raava. Don't worry, she's not like the dark spirits you've probably run into.       
Dark spirits? What's the difference? We throw fire at any spirit we see around here. Just like they attack any man. 
You have no idea what you're doing! You're only making things worse!     
The spirits are coming back! 
Let's wipe 'em out this time. We'll burn down this whole forest if we have to.
What happened to you? When did you become so violent?          
You showed me we could change the world if we just stopped being so afraid. Now we're doing it.       
This isn't what I had in mind.
Wait, we can resolve this peacefully.           
It's good to see you again.           
You are the one who's getting cleared out.      
There's no need  for violence. I know there must be a way to work out a compromise.       
Spirits like him killed our friends. I can't let them get away with that.         
It's Vaatu. He's growing stronger, using their anger to turn them to his side.        
Stop, please! 
Raava, we need to combine our energies. Maybe then we'll have enough power to stop this.  Enough! You need to stop fighting now before you destroy each other.       
He's controlling all four elements.          
Wan, I have to leave your body, or I'll destroy you. 
No. It's working. If you leave, the fighting will start again. 
Wan!                    
We have to go back.       
Don't bother. Your human friends have already been annihilated. 
No!              
Enjoy your final days. See you at the end of the world.          
Raava.            
I'm sorry, Wan.           
We're almost there. I was wrong about you, Wan. I had no idea that humans were capable of such nobility and courage. I'm sorry that we do not have much more time together.    
Let's not give up before the battle's even begun. Who knows what will happen? After all, this is my first Harmonic Convergence. 
This is the Southern portal to the Spirit World. Here, Vaatu and I will do battle once again at the place where the two worlds meet.
Are you ready for our final battle, Raava? Thanks to our friend separating us, I think this time, I may be rid of you once and for all.           
Before you get to her, you'll have to go through me.
No human can stand against me.      
Haven't you heard the legends? I'm not a regular human anymore.                        
I lived 10,000 lifetimes before the first of your kind crawled out of the mud.    
It was I who broke through the divide that separated the plane of spirits from the material world!    
To hate me is to give me breath, to fight me is to give me strength. Now prepare to face oblivion!           
Raava! The only way to win is together.                     
I have to leave you. If I stay any longer, you will die.          
It doesn't matter. If you leave me now, Vaatu will destroy everything. We have to finish this together!               
The Harmonic Convergence is about to begin. The era of Raava is over.
We are bonded forever.
This is your prison now. And I will close the portal so no human will ever be able to physically enter the Spirit World and release you. 
The spirits must stop fighting with humans and return to their home in the Spirit World. I will teach men to respect the spirits so that balance will be maintained. 
I will be the bridge between our two worlds. 
Different groups of people must learn to live together.  This is my mission- to use Raava's Light Spirit to guide the world toward peace.          
Don't worry. We will be together for all of your lifetimes and we will never give up.      
I remember.           
Do you know who you are?      
My name is Korra. I'm the Avatar.         
We've been raising this herd of air bison since the Hundred Year War. I never thought I'd be able to present one to the Avatar.  
Thank you for all your kindness. I wonder how long I've been away.         
That I cannot say, but you do not have much time left. The Harmonic Convergence is only weeks away.       
I have to close the spirit portal before that happens.      
Raava. Raava. Raava...             
A dark energy has infected her. We must purge it before it destroys her Avatar Spirit.  Let the waters cleanse the darkness that plagues your spirit.          
Who are you?         
Who am I?
You are the Avatar.      
I don't know what that is.          
In order to remember, you must regain your connection with your Avatar Spirit.    
If you don't, darkness will engulf the world. You will die, and our era will end.      
How do I regain my connection?         
Go back, return to the beginning. Find Raava.           
Are you Raava?        
No, but I can help you find her. My name is Wan, and I will show you how I became the first Avatar.           
Really? Because I just did.       
Actually, I feel quite alive.        
Hey, fellas. You're just in time for lunch!               
sighs Did you steal from the Chous again?      
Yeah, and I got nothing to show for it except a few dirty rolls and a whole lot of bruises.  Hey, Yao, I got some food for you.    
You guys are hungry too, huh?      
Wan, you should eat.     
They need it more than I do. Besides, I'm tired of eating scraps.  If only there was some way to get into the Chous' food cellar. We'd be eating like- well, like Chous.           
If Chou the Elder catches you sneaking into his palace, you'll end up dead. Or worse, he'll banish you to the Spirit Wilds.      
Don't do anything crazy, Wan. You just gotta accept the world is the way it is. Some people have power. Some people don't. And you don't.          
Not yet, anyway. 
Are you strong? Are you fearless? Do you have what it takes to battle the spirits? Then join the hunt!      
Count me in.                  
We're going to be out in the wilds for a week. You wouldn't last two seconds.          
I can handle myself.  We all get fire, right?     
Yeah, but do you know how to use it?         
Well, not exactly, but I-             
All right. Welcome to the hunt. 
The Lion Turtle.          
Great guardian of our city, we are venturing into the Spirit Wilds to bring back food for our people. Please, grant us the power of fire.          
You're first, kid.      
Whoa!
Just make sure you aim at the spirits, not us, okay?  
Sure thing.
Everyone stay close. Spirits love to pick off stragglers.     
Uh, guys? I don't think I can do this.         
Now, quit your whining. We haven't even seen a spirit yet.          
I think I wanna go home.        
I knew you were nothing but a sniveling coward. Go give your fire back to the Lion Turtle,  and don't ever show your face around me again.      
Wan, you're back.       
What did you do? You can't steal from the Lion Turtle.      
Really? Because I just did.       
You know it's forbidden to bring the power of the element into the city. Please, go back to the Lion Turtle and return the fire.      
Jaya, it's time to stop being so afraid of the Chous and show them we have the power to change things. 
Hey, Chous! Open the gate, and let us in.  
Hand over all the food you're hoarding, and we won't give you any trouble.            
Powerless, huh?  Follow me! 
Grab as much food as you can.           
Maybe you're right. Maybe we do have the power to change things. 
Looks like the Chous found backup.          
Get everyone out of here. I'll hold them off.       
I'm not telling you anything.      
No, wait! Great Lion Turtle, I am sorry for stealing the fire from you, and I accept my punishment. But please, I need to be able to protect myself in the wilds.          
Who said that?        
You're just a little frog.      
Get off me! Get off me!           
Please, help me. I'm starving, and I haven't slept all night. 
Let me pass!         
I am Bushy, the Bush Spirit. And I would like to enter your oasis.           
Come on, let me in, just for a little while.    
Believe me, I'd love to go back home. But I can't. I was kicked out.           
Who are you calling ugly, ugly?
What? There are other Lion Turtles?  
So which way to the nearest Lion Turtle city?
Real funny. You know what? I don't need your help. I'll find it myself.      
It's okay, I'm gonna get you out of there. 
Finally, we caught something. Get it down.
Back off.           
Wan? What are you doing here?    
I'm saving this animal.       
That animal's our dinner. Now, get out of the way.    
No.             
Well, looks like you're all out of tricks, Wan. 
I feel great. What's in this water?      
Thanks.  So what did you do to that hunter?         
Thanks for saving my neck. But why'd you do it?      
Told you I wasn't like the others.       
I was. But I think I've had enough of humans for a while. I've decided to stay here and learn the ways of the spirits.         
First time for everything, right?     
The name is Wan.          
What happened in the wilds? Where are the others?      
Gone. Spirits took them. They were protecting that kid Wan like he was one of their own.           
Did you hear that? Wan's still alive!
The way Wan moves fire, it's like nothing I've ever seen.  He uses it like it's an extension of his body. 
Wan has proven that with the power of fire, anyone can survive in the wilds.  We don't have to live under Chou the Elder's rules anymore. So I say we leave this city and start over!  Who's with me?         
You ready to go, Mula?    
Yes, it's time I see the rest of the world and find the other Lion Turtle cities.  
Thank you for everything. Good-bye, everyone.       
Stop, or you'll destroy everything!
This doesn't concern you, human! 
It does when the lives of spirits and animals are in danger!         
If you're a friend to spirits, then use your fire to help me break free!           
Don't involve the human. This is between us.       
Please, save me. She has tormented me for 10,000 years.           
10,000 years?  Let him go!           
Thank you, human. You have performed a great service for the spirits.
Do you realize what you've done?
Yeah, I helped a spirit who was being bullied by you!  
You are gravely mistaken. I was keeping him under control.         
And what gives you the right?              
You don't even know who I am, do you?             
Should I?           
Yes. My name is Raava. That spirit you freed is Vaatu. He is the force of darkness and chaos. I am the force of light and peace. Since the beginning of time, we have battled over the fate of this world. And for the past 10,000 years, I have kept darkness under control and the world in balance, until you came along.      
So by freeing Vaatu, I let chaos into the world?         
Precisely. The human and spirit realms are headed toward annihilation, and it's all your fault!    
Raava, I found you. 
Where is he?         
Father said he would meet us at this location. He'll be here.  Were you just in the Spirit World?
Never mind that. Where is the Avatar?      
She was within our grasp until a dark spirit attacked her.          
They're out of control.       
You didn't get her?!      
The Avatar is dead.      
We finally made it. Now we must stop the evil Unalaq!
Don't worry, Juji and Roh-Tan, I will end the Evil Unalaq's reign of terror. For I am Nuktuk, Hero of the South!
Nuktuk, you're not just the Hero of the South, you're our best friend. 
You two are the best snow raccoon and arctic panda a guy could ask for.      
Aww.               
Bolin, look up there. What do you see?        
I- is this a trick question?       
I'll tell you what I see- a star being born. You're a star, people love stars. Stars tell them what to think and how to act. Bolin, have you ever tried to force a monkey-marmot to ride a bicycle?
Uh... Not that I can recall.  
Of course you haven't. You can't force monkey-marmots to do anything, they've got to want to do it themselves.      
Right.      
With these movers, we'll have the support of the people, and before long, they'll persuade the President to lend his troops to the war effort.          
Not so fast, Evil Unalaq!  Oh, I will save my true love and the South!         
And now, your time is up.           
No! Please... Power... Weakening.          
Wow. We got some major chemistry on-screen. Am I right?           
Yeah. On-screen.          
What's wrong? Are you mad because I left you in the clutches of the Evil Unalaq? I'm gonna save you in the next episode. Ginger, let's work through this.    
Darn it, Zhu Li, haven't I told you I hate getting bad news without first getting good news?
That's old news! Let's go.                  
Is it true?          
I'm so sorry. Your entire shipment was stolen.
Without that sale, I don't know how much longer I can keep my company going. What am I gonna do?       
Don't worry. I'm gonna find whoever's responsible. Chief Bei Fong is about to question the captain of the ship.       
I know it's been a long day, but walk me through what happened.     
This is the third attack this week. At about the same location.   
Yep, and smack-dab in Republic City's jurisdiction, which means another problem for us.  All this stress is gonna turn old black beauty gray.
It's gotta be Northern Water Tribe. They're trying to stop supply lines to the South.      
I agree. Is there anything else about the attack you remember? Anything unusual?           
Like the bombs at the Cultural Center!
Wait, where are you going?      
I gotta grab some evidence.         
Asami, I heard the news. I can't believe they took my fifth favorite ship in the Varrick Industries fleet! Named her after my mom. Rest in peace, Rocky Bottom.
Without the money from that shipment, Future Industries is almost broke.
Chief, I think there's a link between this attack and the attack at the Cultural Center.     
What do you think you're doing?          
Solving this case. Did any of the people who attacked you have one of these in their hand? I think it's a remote detonator.
Mako!             
Chief, I don't think the people who attacked were Northern Water Tribe.      
Of course they were Northern Water Tribe, they were waterbending!     
Was this one of the guys who attacked?          
Oh, that's embarrassing.         
Nice try, rookie.           
Mako, leave. Now.              
Great work, everybody. Another open and shut case for the dynamic mustachioed duo!
Wait, I think Mako might be onto something.    
Chief, I know it's a long shot, but I have an idea how we can catch these guys.  
Yeah, let's all listen to the rookie.         
He's doing a better job than you!              
Who's hungry?         
Enough! I don't want to hear your lame-brained rookie ideas. You're a beat cop, not a detective. Now hit the street and do your job!           
Lu and Gang are idiots. I hate them and their stupid mustaches.   
Forget them. What's this idea of yours?      
A sting operation. I was thinking we'd set up a bait ship, take it out into the open ocean, and capture whoever attacks it.       
Let's do it!         
It's not that easy. For the plan to work, we need the police, and Bei Fong already said no.            
We can make it work, just the two of us.       
I don't know. I don't want to go behind Bei Fong's back. If she finds out, I could get kicked off the force.      
Mako, I need your help. My mom is gone, my dad is in jail. Future Industries is all I have left of my family.       
I want to help you, but this is more than a two-person job. First of all, we'd need a ship.
You need a ship? I got a ship! I want in on whatever you're talking about. I love being in on plans.               
The less you know, the better.           
Perfect! I love not knowing things.      
All right, I'm in. Let's get these guys. 
The ship's all loaded with the dummy crates. Let's get this sting operation going.   
Not yet. We need some extra manpower.  
What about Korra? No better muscle than the Avatar.        
Right, uh... Korra. Yeah, actually, she's, um- she's out of town right now.  
Everything okay with you two?          
Yeah, yeah. Forget about Korra, I'll go talk to Bolin.     
Hey, Mako, what do you think? I did a little redecorating. It turns out that one of the perks of being a star- You get lots of cash.      
Is this a marble statue of you?             
It's also a hat rack.     
We don't even have hats!      
That's because we've never had a hat rack and now we do. Mako, you seem stressed. I think you need to take a little dipity dip.      
I don't have time to take a "dipity dip", okay? I'm trying to catch whoever's been attacking the shipments, and I need your help.      
You need my help? I don't know. I'm kinda busy.         
You're sitting in a hot tub.          
I'm maintaining my instrument.  As an actor, my body is my instrument.       
Are you gonna help or not?  
You know, I recall a time when I needed your help, and you basically told me to get a life.         
So that's a no. What am I supposed to do now?              
I don't know, Mako. Figure it out. Remember? That's what you said to me. Hurts, doesn't it?          
Ow! My instrument!            
Are you sure this is a good idea?      
No, but it's our last resort.        
I'm not here on police business. I'm running an off-the-books operation, and I thought the Triple Threats might want a piece of the action.      
So Mr. Law and Order needs our help, huh? What's in it for the Triple Threats?     
I am personal friends with the Avatar. I might be able to convince her to give Shady Shin his bending back.           
What about the rest of us?             
I've got vehicles, all brand-new and top of the line. They can be yours if you help.          
I think we got ourselves a deal.             
This is right around the area where the attacks happened. So keep your eyes peeled, and stay quiet.         
Two Toed Ping, please.    
Ping, stay focused!      
You broke up? When? Why didn't you tell me?     
I don't know.         
Sure he did.         
All right, would you guys knock it off and do your job?  
And action!          
Forget about me. You must capture the Evil Unalaq before he gets away!     
No! I'll never leave you.      
Mm!              
Cut! There's no kiss in the script.         
Sorry, I just kinda lost myself in the moment. It just felt so right.     
Ugh!             
It did, huh? Your girlfriend's about to die and instead of untying her, you kiss her. Wait a minute! Maybe that will work.Yes! It's genius! Everybody take five. Except for you, Zhu Li. Grab the tweezers, I've got some neck-hair issues to resolve.                  
So... That kiss. I liked it. And it seemed like you liked it too.           
Ugh! You're confusing Ginger the actress with Ginger the character.      
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm totally getting, like, a weird vibe from you right now. It's like, a minute ago, when we were shooting, you were into me, but now you're not.
That's because Ginger loves Nuktuk, not Bolin. 
But Nuktuk is Bolin. I'm a hero!
Because you have two... extra toes.         
Wait, guys. Do you hear that?           
I didn't hear anything.       
Ah! What's taking so long?  
I'm gonna check it out.       
I told you, it's gonna be a few hours. What, do you have a hot date?           
Well, your date's gonna have to wait.       
Too bad. We were paid to keep Mako and that dame distracted for a few hours, so that's what we're gonna do. 
I just overheard Shady Shin and Viper. We've been double-crossed. We have to get off  this ship.              
Where do you think you're going?                      
Get 'em!              
They're getting closer!     
Not for long.         
Watch out! We're not gonna make it.                
One down, one to go.       
We're stalled!        
Mako, hang onto something.             
What was that all about?      
Someone paid the Triple Threats to keep us distracted. 
Distracted? From what?  Oh, no.             
Whoever paid the Triple Threats stole everything.       
I'm ruined.  
My company... It's over.              
We should check out your other warehouses. Maybe they didn't have time to hit them all.        
You don't understand. Everything I had was in here.          
We have to search the place for evidence. If we can find a lead...    
Mako... It doesn't matter anymore.      
I can figure this out.    
Just stop. It's over. I give up.              
Well, I'm not giving up on you.               
Sorry, I-        
Uh... It's- it's okay. Um... Anyway... I gotta run. I'm gonna find out who did this. And I know just who to ask.           
Who hired you to double-cross us?       
I think you do know. And you're gonna tell me, or we're gonna have to change your name to "No-Toed Ping."
You expect me to believe that?
Get out of here.                 
Bolin, have you seen Varrick around?  Bolin!  Nuktuk.             
Yes? Oh, hello, Mako. Didn't notice you there.       
Where's Varrick? I need to ask him something.              
Hmm. Can't say that I've seen him but I've been kinda busy, you know, rehearsing for my big scene. There's gonna be some crazy "pyrotechnics." That's mover speak for explosions.
Or sometimes we just call them explosions. Anyway, wish I could stand around here and chitchat, but you know, I gotta go shoot my big scene.
Ginger, stay down! I'm coming for you.       
How did you rig those explosions to go off like that?      
Varrick.              
Asami, I think I know who set us up.         
Hello, Mako.         
What are you doing here?      
He just saved my company. Varrick bought a controlling interest in Future Industries. Isn't that great?           
Yep, I like to think I'm always there to stand up for the little guy. Especially if that little guy can help this guy become a bigger guy.      
So what were you saying, Mako? You think you know who hired the Triple Threats?  
Yeah, and I'm real close to proving it.  I'll fill you in later.     
Get away from me!           
It's okay, we're here to help you, Avatar Korra.      
Who's- Who's Avatar Korra?       
What happened to you? How did you end up on our island?         
I... don't know. I can't remember anything.
Yes!  He listened to me, Mako!  I told him not to throw the fight and he listened! 
Oh well,  you know I'm sure they're other factors. 
I am an honorable man; I just needed someone  to remind me.  Here's your money back.  Now get out of my gym. 
Wait. You guys have got some real bending skills! With a little training, I think you could go pro!  I can teach you everything I know. 
I could find you a place to stay right here  in the arena. Who knows? You could be champs!  At least it's a chance at an honest living. 
Can we, Mako? Mako, can we pleeeaaase? 
Sorry, Shady. But you're right, I do have to take care of my brother and I think this is what's best for him. 
I'm so glad we're not criminals any more!  Let's celebrate over dinner! 
I think we better save our money.
Ohhh, I  have lots of money coming. I bet everything  we had on the Boar-q-pines! 
What?  But you knew the fight was fixed. 
What can I say, I had a good feeling.
Light on your feet, Uncle Bumi.  Remember, you want to be quick and evasive.          
Don't worry about me, little lady.  I've been in a scrap or two, you know.  Oh, you're just a youngster,  so I'm going to go easy on you.  Wouldn't want to hurt a kid-          
Woah!              
Uncle Bumi,  you've got to work on your stance changes.  Kai, that was just... really good. 
Thanks, Jinora. You're a great teacher.     
Hmm.  Did I drop my wallet?      
Give me that,  you little thief! 
It's so exciting to be on a diplomatic mission to Ba Sing Se.  What's the Earth Queen like?  
I've never met her, but I've heard she can be quite... Demanding. 
This is it, Mako! We made it! This is where Dad grew up!  Come here, look! Look!     
Okay, calm down. I'm looking.          
I wonder how many airbenders are down there.         
Ugh.  The Lower Ring looks terrible. 
Yeah, I can smell it from here. No wonder Dad left.       
Hello, Middle Ring!      
Wow. Now, this is more like it.      
Avatar Korra, Master Tenzin,  it is a pleasure to welcome you and your party  to the Upper Ring of Ba Sing Se. I'm Grand Secretariat Gun.      
Thank you.   
Ahh,  it's got that  Upper Ring smell.     
Oh, no. The Queen hates animals.  We've got to get them out of sight.          
Well, I can just  stash Pabu in my shirt.  These two are gonna be a little tougher.   
Come with me, hurry. I'll take you to your quarters. 
Now, when you meet the Queen,  make sure you bow low enough. That's very important.  And don't look her in the eye, she can't stand that.  If any food is served, don't eat before she eats. Oh, actually, I have to taste her food first, then she eats, then you can eat. Better yet, just don't eat.   
Seems like an awful lot of rules.     
Oh, you have no idea,  and I'm the one who gets in trouble when people don't follow them. So please,  please,  for my sake, just try not to upset Her Majesty. 
Here we are.          
Ooh, very swanky.       
Now, go in and make yourselves comfortable... 
Hey!             
And keep those animals out of sight in the backyard!  Avatar Korra, if you'd follow me,  we don't want to keep  Her Majesty waiting.      
Your Majesty,  may I present Avatar Korra.   
Well, actually, Your Majesty, I was hoping you could- 
Well, I- I'm not sure what I can do about that.       
I'm very sorry for your troubles, but actually-     
Hey, has anyone seen Kai?   
Kai?             
Kai! Little bro? 
He's not over here.
I don't think I've seen him since we landed.        
I knew that kid was no good. He was just waiting for an opportunity to run away again.          
We have to find him.     
What's the point? He obviously doesn't care about us.     
But he's my new little brother. He's probably lost and scared.           
He is just a little boy, and he's our responsibility. Besides, he's the only airbender we've recruited so far. We can't lose him.       
Fine. Bolin and I will find him.      
I don't really have servants.  But, Your Majesty, the reason for our visit is that we're trying to gather all of the new airbenders who are popping up in the Earth Kingdom, and we'd like your help finding the ones in Ba Sing Se. 
Before we left Republic City, we got some reports.      
Oh. Of course. What is it?           
Yes, Your Majesty.      
Kai! Did you go fishing?  You under the bridge?      
Here, sir, let me help you. 
Yeah, that was really weird.     
Kai!  Get back here!         
Kai, it's us! Mako and Bolin! Your new family!        
Excuse me,  pardon me. No, no, carry on. 
What are you doing running around robbing people? 
I was just practicing my airbending.         
Yeah, right.  Let's go. You're in big trouble.     
Hey!              
Your little brother, huh? 
Yeah, just lovable little scamp, isn't he?     
Reminds me of my little brother.      
This is the express line to the Lower Ring. Next stop, Po Kong Station.        
Ah!              
Oh!              
All right, let's see if we can catch a train back to the Upper Ring.   
We can pay, hold on. Where's my money?  No. Kai wouldn't-  Aw, man!            
Ugh.
Hey!       
The bad news is,  we're stuck here. The good news is,  you can go the bathroom wherever you want.          
Are you sure we shouldn't have brought more people to collect the tax money?       
There are royal guards waiting at the vault. I doubt anything will happen. I think Her Majesty just likes ordering me around.         
Man. Oh, I think  I slipped a disc sleeping here. It's been a while  since we spent the night on a trash pile.  It's about how I remembered.  
I bet everyone's freaking out that we've been gone all night. 
I'm worried about Kai. He's just a little kid out there on his own. He's probably really scared.  
Your breakfast, Master Fung.     
Keep the change.  I love Ba Sing Se. 
Whew, I'm getting hungry.  We might have to hustle up a little breakfast with the old  fruit stand scam. Come on.  You remember how it goes.  I push you into the stand,  you scream,  I pretend to faint. 
I don't want any part of this. Besides,  look at this fruit.  It's disgusting. We don't want to steal this. 
Hey,  you trying to steal my fruit? 
No, I just said I don't want any of this rotten fruit.       
Oh,  you too good for my fruit? This is the best fruit on the block.          
So you want me to steal it?  
I'm confused. Are we stealing the fruit or not?             
I knew it,  thieves!      
What's going on here?     
Dad, these fruit thieves are insulting our fruit.    
Bolin? Mako?         
How do you know our names?  
Yeah, I mean, I'm famous, so I get that, but how do you know his name?  
You look just like San.  Tu, you'll never believe who these guys are. They're your cousins, my brother San's kids.     
Lord Zuko, Uncle. This is a surprise.       
Finally something interesting happens. Ruling the tribe is so tedious.         
Your father sent us a letter years ago with your names,  but that was the last we heard from him. Then we saw your pictures in the sports pages with your bending team, and Bolin, we love those Nuktuk movers. They're hilarious.          
Yeah, they're not really comedies, but, uh-       
Yeah,  I could probably be a pro-bender, or an actor, or something if I lived in a mansion in Republic City like you guys. You don't know what it's like here on the streets.  You gotta be tough.       
Oh, Mako and I grew up on the streets.  We were homeless, then we were kind of in a gang, then we lived in a gym. 
Hey, everybody! Look who's here! San's kids, Mako and Bolin!     
No way.        
Come in.              
Welcome.              
Is it true?  After all these years?     
Boys,  this is your grandmother, Yin.     
Oh, it is so wonderful to finally meet my long-lost grandchildren.  Where is San and your mother? 
Wait, you mean,  you don't know? 
I'm sorry. They were killed when we were little.      
I don't like the looks of this. Let's hurry up and get out of here.      
Go ahead and load it on the airship.         
So much for our escorts.      
Maybe we should've brought everybody else.         
Step away from the gold,  ladies, and you won't get hurt. 
Sorry to disappoint you, but we're taking this gold back to Ba Sing Se.       
Aw, we love gals with spirit. Suit yourself.         
Retreat! Retreat! 
You're on the wrong side of this fight, Avatar!  That gold belongs to the people, not the Queen!         
Why do I get the feeling he's right?    
Why didn't anyone tell us  we have a secret prison we could have been throwing people in?       
I'd like to put my tailor in here. He never gets my cuffs right.  They're so creasy.          
Don't feel bad. I tried to kill Korra  after she ruined my wedding. It happens.         
Let's just focus on keeping this woman in prison.
There's certainly no way anyone's breaking out of here. 
Don't get used to it. 
This is so great. We've never had a family before. Now we've got...  One, two, five, eleven...  A big family! Yeah!              
So why did Dad leave Ba Sing Se?           
Oh, he always had big dreams.  He couldn't wait to get out and see the world.  Your grandfather thought  it was ridiculous.  He wanted San to stay home and work the fruit stand,  but San was determined to leave  and they had a huge fight.  And that was the last time they ever spoke.  Oh, um, sorry, Mom.       
Come with me. 
I have something to show you.  
This is the only letter  we ever got from San. It says he married a beautiful girl from the Fire Nation and had  two wonderful sons.  He sent this picture of you all on his birthday.        
Look, Mako. Dad's wearing your scarf.      
I'm so sad that I never got to meet your mother,  but you have her eyes.  I know from looking  at you two  that she must have been a wonderful bride for my boy.           
I'm sure they would want you to have this.          
Your Majesty,  the Avatar has returned with the tax payments. 
It's being done as we speak.          
So now, Your Majesty, if I could start meeting  some of the airbenders here in the city.           
You make me do your dirty work extorting your own citizens  for your stupid palaces and topiaries, and then you just want to send me away?  We're not going anywhere until we find some airbenders! We know there are some here!  
This isn't over! I'm going to find the airbenders!         
You know, San would have been so proud of you guys.  Traveling the World with the Avatar, he would have loved that.       
We actually need to get back to the Avatar in the Upper Ring.
We're supposed to be helping her find airbenders  in Ba Sing Se.         
What?  What happened?         
One of our neighbors started airbending about a week ago. A couple days later, two Dai Li agents come out of nowhere and snatch him up.  No one's seen him since.    
They say the Earth Queen's locking  all the airbenders up somewhere and using them for experiments.     
Tu!  Don't talk  like that about Her Majesty.  Long may she reign.       
We have to get back to the Upper Ring and tell Korra. 
I hope Kai is okay.      
Here sir, let me help you.  
Hey! What's going on?  I didn't do anything!  I'm with the Avatar!          
Welcome home, Avatar. Thanks for starting a war.      
I didn't start a war!  Well,  I did,  but it's more complicated than you're making it seem.   
Mako,  I want you back on the beat.  There's going to be a Southern Water Tribe peace march tonight. I need you there to make sure things don't get out of hand.  
I'm all yours.        
I'll go too. The people of the South need to see that the Avatar is on their side in the fight against the Northern invaders. 
Great. That should calm them down.  
Maybe you should sit this out. 
What?             
I just think having you there blatantly supporting one side will only make things worse. You could at least try to seem neutral.      
I'm not neutral,  the North invaded my home. The only reason I'm here is to get the Republic to send troops to help the South. 
Zhu Li's  already scheduled a meeting for us with President Raiko tomorrow. We'll get him on board.     
Whatever.  I gotta go to work.       
I better go check on my factory. 
I'm going to find out about this peace march. 
And I am dying for a pedicure! 
So, uh... what should I be doing?     
I don't know, Bolin. Figure something out. 
Say, kid, have you ever seen Republic City at night? 
Sure, I live here.      
Have you really seen it?      
Y- no?            
That's what I thought, come on.      
Leave them. My brother's no threat to us up there. Increase security around the spirit portal. Keeping it safe is our number one priority.   
I need you two to go after the Avatar. She's the only one who can open the Northern Spirit Portal.   
But, father, you told Korra- 
I told  Korra what I thought she needed to hear.       
I'll find her. She stole my husband.      
I need her alive.       
Fine.            
Watch me, Poki.  You lay down and roll over.  Roll over.              
No, no, you can't just demonstrate it, that never works. 
Good!           
Ugh, classic over-rewarding. 
Poki, where are you going?  
Command respect.  Having some trouble, son?       
Poki isn't very good at learning. 
Believe me, I know the feeling. Maybe I can help.  How would you like your old dad to teach you how to be a master trainer? 
Yeah!            
Hey! Stop!  Republic City Police! 
The Northern Water Tribe is out of control.          
I saw a firebender running away from the blast. The North might not be responsible for this.      
Of course they're responsible.  Who else would it be?      
Wow. Usually, when I see flashing lights like this, it's because I got hit in the head with a rock.    
Being famous is like getting hit with a rock all the time.    
Bolin! Bolin! Bolin!  Bolin! Bolin! Bolin! Bolin! 
Well, I took a trip South for the Glacier Spirits Festival, was briefly engaged to a princess, then went through kind of a tough breakup there, was accidentally involved in a civil war... 
But there's nowhere I'd rather be  than pro-bending night in Republic City! Am I right, people?  Republic City! 
Well, I definitely don't miss getting hit with things all the time and the humiliating losing.  I mean, that gets pretty old. You know, sometimes I actually cry myself to sleep... 
I guess what I miss the most are these fans!  They're the greatest fans in the world! Give it up for the fans! 
Look how these people love you, kid. They're eating that cornball spiel  right out of your hand.  
The trick is, whenever I get confused, I just say "Republic City" or "fans," and then everyone cheers.     
I think I just figured out your true calling.
I hope President Raiko listens to us.      
Don't worry, I was a big contributor to his election campaign.  Him and the other guy.  Gotta hedge your bets.     
Hello, Mr. President.  Sir, the Southern Water Tribe-  
Just a second. Keep smiling.   
Eh...     
Now, how can I help the Avatar and my most generous supporter? 
Unalaq's troops have invaded the South. We need you to send the United Forces to help. 
I'm very concerned by what's happening down there, but I don't think it's the Republic's place to interfere with internal Water Tribe matters.  
Unalaq isn't even the rightful ruler of the Water Tribe. He lied his way onto the Northern throne.       
Mr. President, the Republic is already involved in this conflict. The North attacked our cultural center last night.  
Believe me, we are doing everything we can to bring the people responsible to justice.    
"The people responsible"? Who else would it be but the Northerners?      
Now, I know that when you're young, it's hard to keep perspective-    
You're the one who's lost perspective. 
Sending troops is not something I can do at this time, but I promise I will work with Unalaq and the South for a diplomatic solution.  Now, I'm sorry, but my mind is made up. This meeting is over.    
My family is going to be wiped out, and it'll be on your head for doing nothing about it!   
I can't believe the President is doing nothing! He- he doesn't even care!    
I'm sure he cares,  but he can't just tell his people to go fight a battle at the South Pole that has nothing to do with them.     
How could you take his side?! 
What's with you and sides? Why do you always think I'm working against you?    
Well, you're not helping me! I'm trying to get troops to the South, what are you doing? 
I'm doing  my job.       
Well,  excuse me, officer.  Don't let me stand in the way of you writing tickets, I'm just trying to save the world!        
Well, you wouldn't have to if you didn't keep messing it up! 
I can't talk to you when you're like this. 
You're the one who's like this!  
Hey,  in a hurry?  
Sorry, I have to talk to Varrick.       
Yeah, me too.
Oh, hello. See?  I told you I could do it.       
Sorry I ever doubted you. 
We can't wait for the President to act. We need those troops now.     
And my company is about to go under. I have to find a way to make some sales.       
Right. Okay. Got it. Idea storm! Get the supplies.   You're about to get an inside look  at how Varrick Global Industries stays at the forefront of  imagination innovation,  or "imagivation"!  That's trademarked, pal! 
Brain work requires increased circulation.  Let's do this! 
Okay, here come the ideas, fast and furious.   Pink mint lemon tea.   Radio for pets. Uh, hand shoes. Hold on a tic.   We don't need the President to go to the South. We just need the troops, let's go straight to them!   If there's one thing I know about troops,   it's that they love fighting.  
I know General Iroh. He might be willing to help us. 
A man on the inside. Perfect.   And you need to sell some mecha-tanks, I know some people who need them. We'll ship 'em South.      
That's perfect.   You'll be making money for your company, and you'll be helping   to defeat Unalaq.    
It's true.  If you can't make money during a war, you just flat-out  cannot   make money.       
It's dangerous on the seas right now, but I'm willing to try if you are.         
It'll be crazy risky, but I love crazy risky! End storm! 
Zhu Li, get those other ideas  to research and development, I want prototypes by next week. 
I don't understand why it's so hard to get Republic City to support the South. 
Don't worry, I'm already working on that. As soon as people see this,  they'll be lining up to fight Unalaq. Zhu Li, do the, uh-  the thing. 
Don't freak out, it's not real.          
I had a film crew documenting the entire Northern invasion.    
Sorry. I keep doing that.          
We're gonna cut this footage together with scenes  we shoot of our superstar Bolin here playing a Southern Water Tribe hero   battling the evil Unalaq. No one will root for the North after they see  "The Adventures of Nuktuk: Hero of the South"!   
I'm Nuktuk! What do you think? 
Oh, man, you should have seen Varrick today,  that guy is a genius!     
Uh-huh.               
He's gonna help Asami sell her mecha-tanks to the South, and he came up with this great idea for Korra to get General Iroh to fight Unalaq without President Raiko ever even knowing!          
What?  That's a terrible idea.       
And he's gonna put me in the movers  as this hero, Nuktuk.  He's a man of action,  but he's got a heart of gold.  He was born in the tundra.      
Look, I'm trying to do something that's actually important here. 
Oh. Oh, sorry.  Uh, sure. What is it?             
Something doesn't make sense  about this bombing.  I just don't buy that  the Northern Water Tribe was behind it.  Wait a second!  That's him!  That's the guy  that attacked the Center.  I gotta go show this to Bei Fong. 
Glad I could help.  Nuktuk saves the day again! 
All right, Meelo. The first thing you need to do as a trainer is establish dominance.  You are in charge, never forget that. Now call Poki.         
Poki,  come here.  Poki.  Poki, no.               
Meelo...  you're rewarding him for bad behavior.           
But he's tickling me.   
You can't let him nap in the bed with you.  You are the alpha lemur.  He has to sleep on the floor. 
I know it's hard,  but it's for the best.     
No, Poki.  This is my bed. You sleep on the floor.  Being alpha lemur is lonely. 
I know. 
How did this Cultural Center attack happen right under your nose?  And why haven't you arrested the Northerners responsible? 
We're working on it, Sir.   
Well,  work harder. If you don't get any results soon,  I'm going to find someone who can. 
I got a break in the bombing case.  I I.D.'d the guy I saw at the scene.       
That's great,  May-ko.      
Yeah,  you better run that in to Bei Fong right now.      
You think?          
Sure,  you're gonna be a hero.    
What makes a rookie beat cop think he can interrupt my meeting with the President?! 
I'm sorry. I just- um, I found something out about the bombing.
Well, give it to Lu and Gang, you moron. Now get out!  
Sorry, was she busy? 
This is the guy I saw sneaking out of the building right before the explosions. He's a member of the Agni Kais. Someone must have hired him  to make it look like Northerners attacked the Cultural Center.      
Hmm. 
Did you learn anything about that remote control I found at the scene? That's gotta be the key to finding out who's really responsible.       
Listen,  kid, it was the Northern Water Tribe, okay? 
Yeah, give it a rest, super cop.        
I've heard good things about you. You've made some big triad busts for a rookie.          
Thank you, sir.           
And you're dating the Avatar, right?          
Yes, sir.           
I'm concerned that  she might be getting some bad advice from Varrick.  You wouldn't happen to know if they're plotting anything that might compromise the security of Republic City,  would you, officer?  Let me remind you that you've sworn an oath. You're a man of the law before anything else. 
Yes, sir.           
Well, keep up the good work.   
Wait.  There's something you should know.        
Thank you for seeing me, General Iroh. 
What can I do?        
The South needs military support before Unalaq wipes them out completely. But the President is refusing to give the order.  So I decided to come to you directly.    
I see. Well, suppose I were to take the fleet South on some routine training maneuvers. And let's say we were to "accidentally" run into a hostile Northern blockade.  We'd have no choice but to defend ourselves, wouldn't we? 
I guess you wouldn't. Thank you.              
Swapping old war stories? 
Mr. President. 
I hope you're not planning to take any military action without an order from your commander-in-chief.  
Of course not, sir.      
Good, because if a single vessel leaves this harbor without my say-so, you'll be court-martialed. Am I clear?           
Crystal, sir.         
Your activities  here are bordering on insurrection. The Avatar does not command the military of the Republic.  Don't go behind my back again.  As you were, General Iroh. 
I hate that guy!          
I'm sorry, my hands are officially tied.  
I understand.  Thanks anyway.        
But you should talk to the Fire Lord. My mother and grandfather have always been good friends to the Avatar and the Southern Water Tribe. I'm sure they'll be willing to help.     
Thank you, General.  
Wouldn't I be cold wearing this outfit in the snow?
Ah, Nuktuk is never cold.   
Ooh.  Hey, Ginger.          
How about that, huh?  It's the latest product in my Varri-Manageable hair line: Varri-dye!  We get some shots of her using it before Unalaq kidnaps her, I guarantee we sell a million cases week one. 
Bolin,  I need you to watch Naga while i'm gone.      
Where you going?          
The Fire Nation. I'm going to try to get them to help the South.  I need a boat.         
What happened with General Iroh?          
He was going to help, but then President Raiko showed up.  Someone must have tipped him off, but I can't  figure it out. No one knew about it except for us and Asami.    
And Mako. 
Mako? 
What?  There's no way Mako would have told.  Right?                  
Poki, sit.  Roll over.  Good boy! 
Well done, Meelo. I knew you could learn to train Poki.         
Not just Poki.  I trained all the lemurs. Watch.   
I've created a monster. Uh...  maybe we should forget about all this training discipline for now. Why don't you and Poki just have fun and play?     
Thanks, Dad. Training makes me tired.  Come on, Poki. 
You ratted me  out to the President?!           
Korra, let me explain.    
Explain why my boyfriend stabbed me in the back?     
Look, the President of the Republic asked me a direct question. What was I supposed to do?      
You betrayed me and my family! 
Enough! Look, I have a job to do! I can't constantly be worrying about keeping you from making another huge mistake!      
Well, I have a job to do too, only it seems like you're always standing in the way of me getting it done!     
Well, I guess if we're both putting our jobs first, maybe there's no room for our relationship!      
So what? Are you breaking up with me?  
Yeah.  I guess I am.     
What the  flamey-o happened here?         
I broke up with the Avatar.        
You got off easy.  You should have seen Air Temple Island after Tenzin broke up with me. 
You ruined my wedding! 
No one steals my Bolin! 
You're making a mistake.      
I wish it hadn't come to this. But your parents held meetings with the rebels, right here in their home.       
I can't believe you're doing this to your own family.    
Rest assured, I've appointed Judge Hotah to oversee the trial. He is the most fair and honorable man I know.       
Uncle, my parents had nothing to do with the men who attacked you.           
I'm sure you're right. So we should have nothing to worry about.         
I hope so.
Where's Varrick? We should've closed our deal an hour ago.          
Would you relax? This place is great, and the best part about it? Eska doesn't know I'm here.
Ee-yah. I wasn't hiding. Hey, hey-hey, hey.          
I'm not on the hunt for you. Currently.
We search for Varrick. Our father wishes him to stand trial.         
What did he do?           
He is a traitor to the Water Tribe, along with our aunt and uncle. 
What?             
Korra's parents were arrested?
Yes. Your powers of deduction are impressive.         
Yeah, he's a cop.
Very well. Desna, let us continue our search elsewhere.  Boyfriend! Bow to me when I exit.     
Yes, yes, my sweet koala-otter.      
You are so cute when you grovel. 
Don't let her treat you that way, stand up for yourself.     
I tried to break up with her, but Mako gave me terrible advice. Thank you, Mako. 
Wait, how are your girl problems my fault?          
Bolin, you need to be honest with her. Tell her how you really feel.  
Varrick?              
If you want to ditch this girl, then make yourself scarce. Disappear, like I did!     
Where are you?        
Somewhere Unalaq will never find me.  Inside Ping-Ping! How we doin'?      
The coast is clear. You can come out.           
No way, mister. Not until I know it's absolutely, 157% safe.  Ahh! Thank you, Zhu Li.     
Your assistant's in there too?
Zhu Li never leaves my side.  Yuck! Pyugh! Pyuck! You forgot the honey!      
No honey? We're in a bear, for crying out loud!      
I'm gonna go see how Korra's doing. 
Bolin, I got a little something for you 'round back.
Wow!             
Now listen up. Unalaq's rigged this trial, no doubt about it. So I need you to make sure my trusty rebels stay out of prison.       
What's the money for?     
Bribery, of course! There's always someone willing to look the other way for a few yuans.        
I think I catch your drift,  Varrick-Bear.
Ikki! Ikki, where are you?  Shoo! Go bother someone else.  You two are worse than Kya and Bumi.          
Okay, everybody here?      
Ikki! Oh, thank goodness.
Juniper Lightning Bug, paws off the table!  This is going to be a civilized breakfast. Daddy always says a blessing before we eat, so...  Be quiet and listen up!  We are thankful for this super yummy food and for being the best-est new friends in the world. But we are most thankful because Meelo and Jinora aren't here because they stink.  Oh! Hi, Daddy. I guess you found me. Do I have to go now?      
Actually, is there room for one more?          
Uh, sure. You can sit next to Blueberry Spicehead.  
Nice to meet you, Blueberry Spicehead.      
And that's Princess Rainbow, and that's Twinkle Starchild, and that's Juniper Lightning Bug. They're my new brothers and sisters.          
New ones, huh? Can they be my new brothers and sisters too?        
Maybe, but only if they say it's okay.  Uh-huh, uh-huh. No, no, he's nice.  They say it's okay.
We're good to go. I gave all the money to some guys over there. I told them to "take care of it," and then I winked.  Heh. Pretty sure they got the message.
Man! I should have paid him! 
Yeah, you think?          
I was asleep in my chambers when the rebels attacked. They overpowered me, and the next thing I remember was waking up in the snow after Avatar Korra had saved me.
According to Unalaq's testimony, you attended a meeting where Varrick tried to incite a civil war. Is that true?     
Yes.             
And were these men present at that meeting?        
Well, yes, but-  
And where exactly did this meeting take place?  
Objection!          
Quiet down out there!  I'll ask you one more time. Where did the meeting happen?  
My parents' house.      
And who led this meeting?   
Your honor, if I may...       
May what?           
May I... declare a mistrial?  
Sit down.  Varrick and your father led the meeting, didn't they?  
My parents are innocent!      
I've heard all I need to. I'll return shortly with my decision.           
Hey there, Eska!  I was wondering if we could talk.           
I grant you permission to speak freely.        
Oh, good, because I just need to be honest with you. You know, when we first met, there was this crazy spark... but I'm starting to feel like that spark is fading.      
I agree. It is as if a great chasm has formed between us and nothing can bridge it.      
Oh! Oh, yes! I am so glad you understand!  
Nothing, that is,  except marriage.        
We will wed at sunset. You may express your joy through tears.            
Oh, no, I can't- This is really tight.      
Senna, please step forward.  I have found you innocent. You are free to go.      
Korra!            
On the charge of treason, you are all found guilty. The punishment for this crime is death.               
You can't do this! You take their lives, and I'll take yours.      
Korra, calm down. I'll talk to him.  I know I promised to respect whatever decision you made, but I must ask you to reconsider. Show these men  and my brother mercy. 
Very well, I'll change their punishment. Your lives will be spared but you will live them out in prison.             
Thank you, Uncle.       
You like that, don't you, Blueberry Spicehead? Yes, you do.  You know, I could get used to it here. No one's yelling at me or telling me I'm delusional.  
We should have Uncle Bumi and Aunt Kya come visit. I bet they'd like it too.       
Let's not. They'll only spoil our good mood.         
What do you mean? Aunt Kya is super nice and pretty and always asks me how I'm feeling. And Uncle Bumi is, like, the funniest person in the world.          
But what about Meelo? He's hilarious too, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth. And Jinora can be so sweet and gentle.         Ikki:  And mean. And bossy.  Being part of a family is hard, huh, Daddy?      
I couldn't agree with you more.
But I guess the nice part about a family is they'll always be there for you.  Even though Twinkle Starchild and Princess Rainbow fight, they still love each other.   
That's very wise of you, ikki.
We should probably head back, huh?         
I suppose. We can't hide in this cave forever. 
Don't worry, Daddy. We'll come back and visit Blueberry Spicehead. I know you really bonded with her.               
Yes, I'd like that.                
Honey, are you all right?       
I'm fine.           
Good, let's bust you out of here right now.     
Korra, no. Saving me would start a war. If fighting were to break out, the North would crush the South. I'll be all right. Just promise me you won't do anything rash.     
Fine... I promise.              
It's okay, Mom.           
I- I hate feeling so helpless. 
I know.               
What do you want?           
It's not about what I want. It's about what Naga wants.  And she'd like you to let my father out of prison. 
I- I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do. I was just following Unalaq's orders.        
What are you talking about?!  
I- I've said too much.     
Unless you wanna be Naga's afternoon snack, you better keep talking.    
I- I've worked for your uncle for years! He said he needed everyone to think the trial was fair.  
So Unalaq told you what to say?          
Yes! Every word.          
Then why did he have you free my mother and change your sentence?       
He's trying to keep you on his side but he also wants your father out of the way. Just like when he got your father banished.  
What do you mean "he got my father banished"?  
Nothing!              
Keep talking.         
Uh... hey there, Dad. You're looking well.  Look, uh, I'm sorry I didn't turn out to be an airbender like you hoped, but I've tried my best to keep the world safe. Hope I made you proud. 
Of course he'd be proud of you, Bumi. 
Kya! I- I was just, uh...  cleaning off Dad's statue. It's so dusty in here.     
Come here. 
Thanks, Kya. You always know when I need a hug.          
Unalaq's a liar and a traitor!
I've been trying to tell you that from the get-go.        
What happened?        
I found out the truth about my Dad's banishment. Unalaq hired the barbarians to attack their tribe. Then he told them to hide in the spirit forest, knowing my Dad would go after them.      
Unalaq wanted your dad out of the way so he could become chief. It was a setup!         
Just like the whole trial. I can't believe I trusted him. I'm busting my father and the rebels out of jail. I need your help.           
If you do this, there's no going back.     
I know. Will you help me or not?    
Of course I'll help.     
Me too.               
Count me in!         
I don't even want to know.  
So I'm guessing the breakup with Eska didn't go well?       
No, no, the honesty thing worked out great.  So great that she decided we should get married!     
Sorry.            
I'm pretty sure the guy is supposed to give the girl the betrothal necklace.     
I guess Eska didn't get the memo. 
Look, the only way to deal with crazy women is to lie big and leave fast. Lucky for you, Varrick's got your back. Now gather 'round Ping-Ping. Let's talk plan.        
My dad's in there.  Where is he?          
I'm sorry, Korra.  You'll never see your father again.          
Where's my father?      
On a ship headed to the Northern tribe.  He'll serve out his sentence there.       
Bring him back or I'm taking you out, and the rest of your army.      
Remember who you are. As the Avatar, you cannot threaten war. You must remain neutral, or our tribes will never find unity.     
You don't want unity, you want power. You've always been jealous of my father, haven't you? You got him banished so you could become chief and I bet it just killed you to learn he was the Avatar's father. No wonder you kept trying to take me away from him.       
All I've ever wanted is to help you realize your destiny. 
Well, I don't want your help anymore.            
If you start a war, the dark spirits will annihilate the South and even I will be powerless to stop them.          
I'm done being manipulated by you. You're going to bring my father back, then you and your troops will return to the North. 
And why would I do that?     
Because you still need me to open the Northern portal.  
No, I don't.  You've served your purpose.           
If we get to Varrick's boat, we can still save your father. 
Let's go!           
Uh, you fellas seen a traveling circus come through here?          
Zhu Li, do the thing.     
Where's your dad?       
On a ship headed North.  Think we can catch up to it?  
Sure, once you get us past our friends from the North.   
If only we had a plane to get me close to those ships. I could waterbend them out of the way.         
A plane? Well, why didn't you say so?     
Um, why do you have a plane on your boat?          
In case the boat sinks, of course.              
But there's no runway, how are we supposed to take off?
Zhu Li! Take a note, build runway.        Zhu Li:  Yes, sir.           
I have an idea.           
Now!             
There! My dad's on that ship! 
Jump!              
Where are the prisoners?      
Korra, this is crazy. You promised me you wouldn't do anything rash. 
I had to. I'll explain later.       
Sweetie! You're okay!  Oh, I was so worried!  Do you have something you wanna say to your sister?  
Ikki, I'm glad you're back.  
Yeah, sorry we made fun of you.       
Thanks.  Wanna play air ball?      
Sure!             
Yeah!               
I wanted to apologize for how I acted yesterday. I've worked so hard to celebrate Dad's legacy that I may have overlooked the parts of him that were less than ideal.      
And we're sorry for dumping our frustrations with Dad out on you.           
Yeah, you didn't deserve that.
I thought you two might wanna see this. Mom gave it to me before we left.         
That is one good-looking family, huh?       
That's one happy family.      
So once I knew the truth, I couldn't sit by and do nothing.         
My own brother betrayed me. And our entire tribe!     
I've been running from my past for too long. It's time to put my brother in his place.          
Mine too. I'll be proud to fight alongside you, Dad.  
No, Korra.          
But you said the South doesn't stand a chance against Unalaq's forces. I can help.           
The best way for you to help is by getting the President of the United Republic on our side. The South can give Unalaq a good fight for a while, but we'll need the United Forces in order to win this war.       
All right, I'll get you all the help you need.  I love you, Dad.        
I love you too.           
I really need to thank you, Korra.             
For what? I started a civil war.     
Exactly! Now Eska and I are officially broken up.       
Oh, looks like we have company!
And not the fun kind!      
What is that?     
That would be my darling Eska.  Quick question: Is this thing fast enough to get away from my crazy waterbending ex-girlfriend?   
Why do you think I built this boat?          
While you're playing fetch, four of the most dangerous criminals in the world are hunting you down. We should get moving.
Relax, we just got here. Besides, no one knows where I am right now except us. 
I think she wants you to throw it for her.
I'll pass, thanks. 
We just got a call on the radio about another airbender!
Finally! Where are they?
A city called Zaofu,  the home of The Metal Clan.
You know the place?
Er, never been. But I don't want you going there. I'd rest a lot easier if you were back safe in Republic City. 
Sorry, but if there's an airbender in Zaofu, then that's where we're going next. 
Wow, wow, WOW! An entire city made of metal! Oh hoho! You should be right at home, Bei Fong.
Hmm...
Yeah! 
Aren't you coming? 
What's there to see? It's metal, big whoop. Just find the airbender and let's get moving.  And don't tell anyone I'm here. 
Why not? 
I don't need to explain myself to you, just do what I say. 
Fine.  You got it, Chief Crankypants.
Avatar Korra, it is an honor to meet you.  My name is Aiwei. 
Thanks for having us. 
Is this everyone? 
Yup!  Just us. So, can I meet the new airbender?  
Of course.  Right this way.
And this is the Air Acolyte dining hall where everyone eats.  And this is Daw, he's a new airbender too,  like you guys. 
It's so nice to meet you! How exciting, new friends.
Excuse me, hello?  My name is You Ru,  I heard this was the place to come if you're a new airbender. 
You got that right, stranger.
Well, a couple of weeks ago, I woke up and suddenly I could do this. 
Mom!  Aunt Kya!  We got another one!
That statue honors the first metalbender, Toph Bei Fong, who expanded the possibilities of what benders were capable of. Here, everyone is encouraged to reach his or her highest potential.
Does Toph live here?! Are we gonna get to meet her??
I'm afraid not. She used to visit from time to time but years ago, she left to wander the World, in search of enlightenment. No one has seen her since.
Wow. Is this where the airbender lives? 
Yes. But first, her mother wants to meet you. 
Training? 
Not exactly. They're rehearsing for a dance premiere next month.
That's it for today, everyone.
Allow me to introduce the matriach of The Metal Clan, Su Yin.
Please, call me Su.  Great to finally meet you, Avatar Korra.  And this must be Mako, Bolin, and Asami.
You've done your research. 
I make it my business to know who's visiting my city. 
So, you're a dancer?
Dancer, leader, wife, mother, collector of rare meteorites. You'll find people here have many skills and interest.
Korra, why did you lie when Aiwei asked if there was anyone else with you?
What? I- I didn't. I mean...
Oh...
How did you know I was lying? 
I am a Truth Seer. When people lie, their heart rate and breathing increase.  I can sense the most subtle of changes. 
Thanks to Aiwei, there are no secrets in our city. 
We came with Republic City's Chief of Police. She didn't want anyone to know she was here. I'm sorry I didn't tell you. 
Lin's here? Well, I would love to say hello. 
Wait, you two know each other?
You're joking, right? 
Lin never told you about me. 
No... why would she?
I'm Lin's sister.
I found out  why you were so against coming here.  Why didn't you ever tell me you had a sister? 
Half-sister. 
Same Mom, different Dads. So what?  We're blood Lin, and after thirty years, the least you could do is say hello.
I have nothing to say to you.
You two haven't spoken in thirty years?? How come?
Ask her.  I've tried. 
Oh, don't put that on me.  You're the one who tore our family apart.
And you've done a bang up job of keeping it that way.
You haven't changed one bit, have you?
Look, we can stand here arguing about the past all day but that's not the reason the Avatar came here. My daughter is thrilled to meet you.
Yeah. Terrific. 
Those are my two youngest, Wei and Wing. They're playing a game called Power Disc, they invented it all on their own.
Oh nice power, Wei.
Ha! Wing goes down!
I'm so proud of those two.
Huan, I want you to meet the Avatar and her friends, and your Aunt Lin.
Nice to meet you. 
Hey. 
Wow, that's a really nice... banana? Yes, very- very life-like.
It's not a banana!  I was inspired by Harmonic Convergence. It represents the dawning of a new age. Obviously.
Oh yeah, no, I could- I could totally see that.  Oh, let me stand here, yes, I could see that now. Yes. Thank you.  Banana. I mean that's a banana, right?
And this is my daughter, Opal. 
Wow, Avatar Korra.  I can't believe you're really here. You are so amazing. 
It's great to meet you, Opal.
Opal. That's a beautiful name.
Thanks.
I'm Bolin. 
Opal.  But uh- you already knew that.
Great, we found the airbender. Let's take her back to the airship and get out of here. 
And the woman apparently trying to abduct you is your Aunt Lin.
Really? I've always wanted to meet you! My Mom has told me so many stories about you.
I'm sure she has.
So I've set all of you up in the guest houses while Korra trains Opal.
Oh, I'm sorry. But I was hoping she could train with rest of the airbenders at the Northern Temple. 
That sounds amazing!
Nonsense. This is where Opal's home and family are, you can train her here. 
I guess I could help her get started.
Absolutely not! We're leaving. 
She's just a little worried because there are a bunch of crazy criminals after me. 
If you're concerned about security, don't be.  This is the safest city in the World. Now I will see you all at dinner and come hungry, my chef will blow the taste buds right out of your mouth.
Why do you have such a problem with your sister? She seems nice. Come on, we can stay a little while.
Okay, let's see what you got.
I'm not very good. 
That's okay. I've never been a teacher before so, we're in the same boat.  You want to keep your elbows in,  torso straight, feet just skimming the ground. 
Why don't you try it with me?
Wow, you're a natural. 
You really think so? Thanks. 
You call yourself an airbender? Disgraceful! 
Be the leaf!
But, I don't know what that means!
Now that man's a leaf!
A student is only as good as his master. 
Great news! I just got a message from Tenzin, he's with a whole group of other airbenders at the Northern Temple and he wants all of you to join them! We leave first thing in the morning.
And the Avatar is with them?
No... apparently she had to split off from Tenzin.
That's unfortunate, I was really looking forward to meeting her.
Tonight, for your dining pleasure, I present a seared wild Kyoshi-Elephant koi  paired with a ginger infused pea tendril, and hibiscus root salad. 
Stunning. 
Sorry dear, I'm going to have to take dinner  in my office. I just had a major breakthrough on the tram station remodel.
Well don't let me stand in the way of inspiration.
You're the best!
That was my brilliant architect of a husband, Baatar, and our oldest son. He engineers all my husband's projects. 
Five kids, what a nightmare. 
No no, my children are a blessing.
Yeah, Mom used to say that too but she never meant it.
Mmm,  I have to admit,  I was pretty skeptical when he said pea tendril.  But this is delicious! 
I know, right?  I don't think I've ever had a bad meal in my life. 
Oh, I had plenty when Mako and I were living on the streets.  I mean, you'll be surprised how bad food from a dumpster can be. 
I'm sorry, I didn't know. 
No it's okay, it's okay, it's all in the past. Things are great now.  I got to be a pro-bender, fought against a dangerous revolution, become a mover star, and now I'm helping the Avatar rebuild a whole nation!
Wow, your life sounds so exciting. 
How's your search for the new airbenders going? 
Honestly, not great. We had to rescue a whole group of them from the Earth Queen. 
Oh, she's horrible!  She thinks she can just do whatever she wants. 
Sounds familiar. 
What? 
Nothing. 
I mean the idea of even having a queen is so outdated, don't you agree Korra?
I- I haven't really thought about it too much. 
Well, you should start. The World is evolving and the Earth Queen can evolve with it.  Step aside. 
Hey everyone,  my little sister is an expert on World Affairs now. 
You want to talk about what's really bugging you  because I'm right here!
Sorry we're late, everyone.
Varrick!
What are you doing here?
Great question, Asami. I mean, what are any of us doing here? Wow. Food for thought.  Anyhoo, how's our company doing? 
You mean  my company? Future Industries reverted back to me  after you plotted to abduct the President.
Allegedly plotted to abduct the President. Never convicted.
Err, that's because you escaped prison.
No, the universe decided to set me free.  So, I looked up my old friend Su Yin here, pitched her a few ideas, and  BAM! We're in business together!
Varrick's setting up my new technology division. 
I've seen the future and the future is-  Magnets!  I'm working on a high speed rail that would revolutionize transportation and shipping as we know it! But that's not all, I'm-
Alright, enough!  I'm trying to keep the Avatar safe and you're harboring a criminal? 
Ease up, Lin. Sure Varrick's made a few mistakes in his past but that doesn't mean he should pay for it the rest of his life. My chef was a pirate but now he's a culinary master. People change.
You haven't!
Lin!
So, you  and Opal seemed to hit it off at dinner. I think she's really into you.
Yeah you know, she's sweet and pretty and super nice. Too bad she's not my type. 
Right, I forgot. Your type is dumb mover star or  psycho ice princess. 
You know, that hurts a little bit.  Right here. 
Maybe you're right, bro.  Maybe Opal is Bolin material. Thanks.  Yeah.
You know,  before I built this city there was nothing here.  I wanted to make my mark on the World
Can I ask, what happened with you two?
It's complicated. We didn't have a normal childhood. Neither of us knew our fathers and Toph was always busy being Chief of Police. Because Mom grew up in such a strict house, she gave us all the freedom in the World hoping we figure out our own paths.
That sounds like a good thing.
And in a way, it was. But we both ended up fighting for Mom's attention. Lin followed in her footsteps and became a cop. I was...  more of a rebel. Mom wasn't too happy with how either of us turned out. When I was sixteen, I left home to explore the World.  I sailed the seas on a pirate ship,  joined a traveling circus for a while, and lived in a sandbender commune in the desert.  It took me a while but, I finally realized what I was looking for was a family. So I bought this plot of land, found a brilliant architect who later became my husband and created a place I could truly call home. 
It sounds like you created a perfect life here.
Almost. I always wanted Lin to be a part of it but I gave up hope long ago of her ever coming around.
Hey,  little lady.  Wow, you really blowing me away with your airbending. Whoosh.
Why are you acting weird?
Why are you acting weird?
I don't like how you're talking to me.
Who said I liked you? 
Oh no. But I thought...  Mako said...
Just kidding. But do me a favor and stop trying.  Well, don't stop trying. Just stop trying so much, just be yourself.
Huh. Be myself. Yeah, I guess I could give that a shot.
Ahem. 
Oh. Hey, Korra. 
Can I steal you away from Bolin for a minute? I need your help with something.
Let go your earthly tether, enter the void, empty, and become wind.
What are you doing?  No one's allowed in Daddy's study except Daddy. 
I'm sorry, I couldn't sleep.
What were you reading?
A poem by Guru Laghima. The wisest airbender who ever lived.
Ikki.  You should be in bed. Come on.
Night.
Good night.
You seem to know a lot about airbender history for someone who just got airbending. 
I've always admired the culture. 
And you moved through those gates like a natural.  Where did you say you were from?
A small village up North. You probably never heard of it. 
Wait.  Zaheer!
I need some help!
Sorry I wouldn't be joining you at the Northern Air Temple. I'm afraid I have other plans.
Who is it?
Hey. It's me.  I brought someone who wants to talk to you. 
You want to talk?  Then talk. 
I'm sorry being here has been so hard for you.  When you showed up, I was so excited to get to know you. I heard so many great things about you from Mom and Grandma Toph. So, I guess I was kind of sad that you didn't want to get to know me.
Believe me, I know my family can be a little crazy and overwhelming sometimes  but  I would love it so much if you would be a part of it. 
Get out. 
Sorry, did I say something wrong?
Get out!
What's your problem? Don't get mad at Opal,  I asked her to talk to you because I thought it would help you snap out of whatever funk you're in. And I guess I was wrong. 
Why don't you focus on fixing the World and  stop trying to fix my family! 
Su's right. You're never gonna change.  You're always going to be a bitter, lonely woman. 
His pupils once again pleaded with their master  to eat something, but he refused,  just like he had each day the entire summer.  Instead, he simply meditated, getting his nourishmen from the universe. So Monk Tang Xu completed the ninty-seventh day of his historic fast on which island?    
Ooh! Ooh, ooh!        
Anyone besides Otaku, who already studied this in his acolyte training?    
Ooh, ooh, ooh!        
And is answering every question?         
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!  Whaletail Island!           
That is correct. Again. Now, on day ninty-eight-        
Greetings, Air People. I come seeking boring stories to take back to the Spirit World. 
That was incredible! When do we get to fly around on our bison like that?     
Only after many years of practice and intense training.  Besides,  we don't have enough bison here for all of you.      
What about those?  It's a whole herd of bisons.  
Actually, the plural of "bison" is "bison."    
Whoa!              
Cool!            
Wow, look at that. 
Can we ride those?  
No, that's a wild herd. It would take many years to tame them. Now let's get back to our lessons.         
Dad!  We brought you more airbenders!        
Okay, everyone is dismissed. We'll just... pick this up...  tomorrow. 
How was everything in the city?          
Well, we had a little scare, but everything is okay. Zaheer infiltrated the Air Temple.         
What? Is everyone all right?     
Everyone's fine.  I fought with him, but he got away. And he stole some old necklace that had something to do with Guru  Lak...  schmeer.    
Guru Laghima.    
Right. You know, I can never keep all those gurus straight. There were, like, a million of them. Remember that long, boring story about the guy who never ate?         
Yes, I remember.  
Are you all right? Where are you?         
With Bei Fong's sister in Zaofu.  We're totally safe,  unless we get caught in another fight  between Su and Lin.       
Lin willingly took you to her sister?         
Not exactly. We got a call about a new airbender, and it turned out to be Su's daughter, Opal. She'll be headed your way soon.         
Really? That's wonderful!     
She is wonderful  and pretty and so smart!  And she smells like flowers.  Sorry. Bolin out. 
How's the training going?   
Not so well, I'm afraid. No one seems to be interested in the hard work required to become a part of the Air Nation.          
You need to give yourself a break. Let Jinora and the kids help you out. And what about Bumi? He was a naval commander. Maybe he has some ideas about how to get people motivated.     
Bumi? He's my worst student!     
Yeah, but he loves to organize people. If you ask him for help, you can trick him into taking more responsibility by making him think the whole thing was his idea.  
Hmm. That actually sounds like a good plan.  You're turning into a pretty wise Avatar after all. 
Conflict resolution. It's what I do.   
We should go down there. I want to fly one of those bisons.      
I don't know. We might get in trouble.    
Come on, let's have some fun. We'll be back before anyone realizes we're gone.      
I guess it will be all right.    
Look, baby bisons.  How come they're all on the ground?         
Air bison calves can't fly for a week or two after they're born, so the entire herd will stay near the ground in the valley.      
Let's go see the babies.      
Be careful. The mothers are very protective.
Aw, look how cute.    
Kai, get out of there!  
Whoa! 
Wow, you really saved me down there.   
You know, you're an incredible airbender.    
Well, I've been training for a long time.        
Then why don't you have tattoos like an airbending master?      
My Dad says I'm not a master yet.      
You can do everything your Dad can,  plus you have all those spirit-y powers. If anyone's a master, you are.
So we bring the net down on  the head pirate, and he looks around real sad and says,  "I knew I should have followed my dreams and become a dentist."     
How come you grew up to be so cool, while Tenzin became such a stick in the mud?    
Well, I guess "cool" is just something you're born with.
Bumi, can I talk to you?    
Let me guess. You want to criticize me for something. 
Actually, I need your help.  
Oh, yeah? With what?              
I don't think I'm doing very well with the new airbenders, and everyone knows you're a natural leader. 
True, I did win the Admiral Tung Natural Leadership Award. Twice.             
What would you do if you were in charge? Help me be more like you.       
I'd love to.  You've gotta use military discipline to whip these troops into shape. The only way to deal with new recruits is to  break them down, so you can  build them back up. Rule with an iron fist!  Show them who the master is. 
Thanks for the insight. 
My pleasure.    
Dawn patrol! Everyone up!          
What are you doing?  It's barely light out.     
I'm taking your advice. I'm going to break you down and build you back up.  Now get moving, recruit!
Nothing like a ten mile hike first thing in the morning.   
Don't these robes come in a warm, bison fur version?  
No, of course not!  
Oh!   If it weren't so cold,  I'd go right back to sleep.   
Then this is the perfect time to learn meditation and proper breathing technique.  Airbenders are able to warm themselves with only their breathing.  Everyone get into the lotus position. Ah,  this is so much more refreshing than sleeping.       
You know, when I said that thing about an iron fist-
Hush. Meditation time. Focus.       
Can we go back to bed now?  
Now that we're refreshed and loose from our hike and meditation, it's time for a balancing exercise. 
The key is to maintain your heaven and earth connection. 
Now you try.   
Back on the posts!     
It's not hard if you concentrate! 
Get back up!  What's the matter? You can't handle it, soldier?  
Don't you think you're being a little hard on them?     
Don't worry. They can take it. You'll see. Ignore the lemurs digging in your ears.  Concentrate on your breathing,  and you won't even know they're there. 
Whoa, uh, ugh, oh!   
When the head is shaved,  an airbender is able to feel the wind around him.  It is both humbling and freeing.  
Hey,  you wanna  sneak away and go check on the baby bisons?       
Shh. You should be paying attention. 
All right, who's next?    
I'm not sure I want to shave my head.  
That's fine. Shaving your head is a personal choice.      
Wait, what?!        
Anyone else?  Fine, then we can get right to our next training exercise. Obstacle course!
You're pushing too hard. Maybe we should give them a break.            
Jinora, I have this under control.         
Concentrate!  Remember, airbenders move like the wind.         
Stay light  on your feet,  and you'll never feel the stinging rash-cactus.       
Everyone is waiting for you, Bumi!  If you don't make it over in the next thirty seconds, they'll all have to run through the course again.    
You can do it, Bumi!  
Come on! 
Get back on that wall, recruit!  You're letting your fellow airbenders down.  
I'm finished!  I never wanted to be an airbender, and I'm too old  to be back in boot camp! Count me out.        
Fine, quit! We don't need your attitude in the new Air Nation.     
Master Tenzin?  When do we get to go home and visit our families?     
Go home? You just got here.          
Can I change out of my robe now? It's itchy.           
This is just as bad as the Earth Queen's prison.  
I'm tired of all this complaining!  Jinora, take over.          
Does this mean  I'm the master now?       
Yes. Just lead them through some basic exercises.  
Well, since I'm a master,  when do you think I can get my tattoos?           
What brought this on?   
I was just talking to Kai, and he was asking me, so-      
Kai!  What does he know  about when you should get tattoos?! The answer is no! You're just a little girl.      
I'm not a little girl anymore! I can airbend just as well as you. I know everything about our culture and history,  and I have a stronger connection with the spirits than you ever will.  Lead your own class!  
Ikki, Meelo, you're up.  Just lead them through the Ba Gua circle.       
Look to your left!  Look to your right!  One of those people will not make it out of here alive.     
Sorry if what I said got you in trouble with your Dad.         
It's not your fault.  He just can't believe that I'm grown up now and I don't need him telling me what to do like one of his recruits.       
I know  something that'll cheer you up.     
Where did all the spirits go?    
Where are the babies?     
Tattoos. How can she think.  Focus. Breathe.  Bumi ruins everything. Inhale.  Focus.             
Taking a little break from teaching?         
I failed. Bumi quit, and the rest of the airbenders want to go home. Can't they see that I'm trying to rebuild an entire culture?          
You know, just because these people can airbend,  it doesn't automatically make them Air Nomads.      
Tell me about it.       
I remember when  I moved out of my parents' house to become an Air Acolyte. That first night, I was so scared and lonely,  and the bed was so hard.    
It's actually better for your back.  Sorry.             
The point is,  I really wanted to be there, but it still took time for me to adjust and feel like I was a part of it all. These people are probably feeling the same way. You have to be patient.     
Now I know how Korra feels when I'm talking to her.  Thank you, Pema.    
Bumi,  I want to apologize for losing my patience.     
I'm not talking to you.   
Hey, get back here! 
Where's Jinora?         
I saw her fly off on her glider with her boyfriend.       
What? Her boyfriend?!  Kai.      
How can you steal  these bison? They're endangered.       
You're disgusting.           
Hey, do that spirit beaming thing  you did to find me. Go to the temple for help.      
I can't, I'm all cramped in here, and I need quiet and time to focus.  But maybe I can send a message. 
Spirits, I need your help.   
Go find Bum-Ju. Tell him we're in trouble.      
No, I don't think I should apologize. Tenzin just wants to boss everybody around. I'm too old for that.    
Well, let's face it. I'm just not cut out to be an airbender.  
Well, that's your opinion.  
Wait, did Jinora send this spirit?  Is she in trouble?      
Jinora's in trouble! We have to go get her.     
How do you know?          
Bum-Ju's friend told me.      
You are able to communicate with the spirits?           
More or less. I get the gist.  Let's go!   
Shouldn't Master Tenzin be dealing with this?  I don't want to get into trouble.      
Master Tenzin isn't here. It's up to us. Ikki and Meelo, grab some bison. Airbenders, move out! 
Bison rustlers.  They've got Kai and Jinora locked in crates.  Looks like they're getting ready to leave. We'll have to move fast.    
I don't know if I'm ready to get in a fight with some bison rustlers.  I can tell without the telescope that they're mean-looking.      
Listen, this is what we've been training for.    
We haven't been training that long. 
That's not important now. Remember how we persevered together on the obstacle course?
You actually quit.      
Well, I'm not quitting now.  I know we've had a tough time, me more than anyone.  But we're airbenders, and there aren't many of us, so we've got to stick together. They've got two of our own in cages out there, and we're not leaving until we bring them home.       
Leave no airbender behind!  
In, down, and... twist.         
Free the bison first.     
Kai!             
What's going on down there?  
Kai, help!          
I'm coming, Jinora.     
You think you can kidnap Jinora and all these baby bisons?!     
Kai! That's enough.  An airbender never attacks a defenseless opponent. 
But that was very good technique.  
Maybe you boys haven't heard, but there's some new airbenders around these parts. And you never mess with an airbender's bison.  
Without my shaved head, I never could have dodged that net. I really felt it coming at me. You guys should totally get shaved.   
I'm proud of you. Your connection with the spirits and natural leadership... You remind me of Dad.      
I'm sorry I've been causing you so much trouble. I guess I was just scared of not being able to measure up as an airbender. You know, even though I'm Aang's son, I never really felt like I was part of the Air Nation before. 
You are now.         
They're so friendly now.      
The bison are the original airbenders. They recognize their own kind.       
I'm sorry for running off.  
We're just lucky no one was hurt.        
I know.              
But I also realize that perhaps I was too harsh with you.       
Does that mean I can get my airbender tattoos?      
It's hard for me to believe that my little girl has grown up enough to have her tattoos. But I promise I'll think about it. Fair enough?       
Yeah.             
Jinora, look! They're flying!       
I guess everyone is growing up.    
Hey, has anyone seen Chief Bei Fong?         
She's probably off sulking in her room.          
I know she has a problem with me, but she had no right to yell at Opal last night.    
All set for your power disc game today, guys?          
Yeah, all set to kick Wei's butt.       
I'm going to power disc your face.           
You should come play with us. 
Oh, I don't think I'd be much competition since I can't metalbend.    
Really?  Lin never offered to train you?            
Nope, and I guess I never thought to bring it up because I was learning to airbend, then there was the pro-bending, then I got tied up fighting the Equalists. It was a busy few months.       
Well, it's probably for the best.  I'm sure Lin would be a horrible teacher.  As the Avatar,  you should have mastery over all the elements. I'd be happy to show you the basics.           
Really? That would be great.      
You should try it too.  
Uh, nah, I'm more of an Earth guy. The dirt, rocks, you know, maybe some light gravel- That's kind of where my heart is.          
Okay, Earth guy. Well, let me know if you change your mind.    
It worked! Zhu Li, mark it down.  Magnet suit test successful. Power down. 
On to phase two-  Zhu Li cleans up this mess.   
What do you two think you're doing?! Get back to work!           
Is everything all right here?         
The Avatar is in danger, and these two knuckleheads are just standing around chitchatting.          
Don't worry.  Zaofu is the most secure city in the World.          
I'll be the judge of that. I'm going to check every inch of this place.    
Lin, you do not have to work while you are here. You need to relax.          
I'm fine!           
Doesn't take a Truth Seer to know that you are under a dangerous amount of stress. If you don't deal with your repressed feelings, there will be severe consequences to your health. And your job.          
I'm not interested in talking about my feelings.          
You won't have to say a word.  I know a great acupuncturist in town  who will be able to help you.          
Hmm.             
You still want to try to take out the President?      
No. He'll have to wait. We leave today.         
There's our ticket out of here.          
How many of those things are you gonna stick in me?      
I'll be placing several needles on each of your acupoints.  There's nothing to be scared about.       
I'm not afraid of needles!  
Please close your eyes and take a deep breath.     
This process will correct the imbalances in your chi. Please tell me if you feel any pain or pressure.      
I can't feel a thing.     
That's unusual.  Your chi must be powerfully blocked. We're going to need more needles.  Acupuncture often taps into people's buried memories.  These memories can sometimes be difficult to process. 
Heh. Buried memories, uh-huh.    
These meteorites are perfect for beginning metalbenders. The metals have a unique property,  making them easier to bend.   
That's amazing!           
Here, try it.    
Okay.             
Bolin, is that you?       
No.             
What are you doing?      
Oh, hey, ladies. I was just, uh- I was just looking for Pabu. Pabu!              
He's on your shoulder.    
Oh, look, there you are. You know, I thought something was chewing on my ear. I'm probably gonna need to get a shot. Pabu has sort of a venom- a venom.  Anyway, so what are you guys doing? You're metalbending over here or something?          
Want to give it a shot?       
Nah, it's okay. I mean, only, like, one earthbender in a hundred can metalbend.         
Well, don't believe everything you hear. The only thing limiting you is your attitude.           
You know, well, maybe I'll just- I'll just stay and watch.       
Try to focus on the fine pieces of earth within the metal.    
I can't believe it. I'm metalbending!           
Wow, you picked that up really,  really quick. I guess you're that one in a hundred.          
Great job, Korra.       
Wait!  Leaving in the middle of a session could make you sick.
I'm done here.
For the way you treated her last night.  Are you okay?  You don't look good.      
I'm fine.  
What did you do to me?     
I tried to warn you.  Come with me.  Let's go finish the session.  Just relax and breathe.   
Let's get out of here!  
Hey, Bolin! 
Opal!  Oh, wow. You really know how to sneak up on someone.           
What are you doing?      
Oh, nothing, you know,  just- Just thinking  about my body and mustaches that I might have in the future.  
You're acting weird again.  
Sorry. I wasn't really thinking about all my mustaches. I'm just- I'm just frustrated. I've been trying to metalbend, and I can't figure it out. Don't tell anyone, okay?    
Why not?        
Because it's- it's embarrassing. This isn't the first time I've tried. I mean, I've been wanting to metalbend ever since I heard about Toph.  Your grandmother is my biggest hero.       
My Mom grew up learning from Toph. Just go train with her. Stop being so scared.      
You know what? Maybe I am scared, but what about you?  I know that you want go to the Northern Air Temple to train with Tenzin, but you haven't done it because you're afraid too.      
You know what? You're right. I don't want to leave my family and disappoint my Mom.  
Look at us... Talking about our feelings,  supporting each other.     
It's nice.     
What were  you thinking?! And what were  you thinking?  You two have put me in an impossible position!      
Ugh, all right, enough!  Here's what we're going to do.  Su, you need to leave the city as soon as possible. 
You'll go stay with your grandparents.  Lin, give me the arrest report.     
I'm the Chief of Police! I can't have a daughter in jail.            
This is our only option.    
You're going to feel a bit fragile,  so it's probably best if you take it easy for a little while.
I don't need to rest. I need to do something I should've done a long time ago. 
Congratulations. You're the first metalbending Avatar.   
So, um... I've been thinking, and I'd like to try to learn metalbending.  I mean, I'm sure you have a waiting list or something, like, a couple years, so...   
Let's get started.  
I think Lin is mad about something.   
Su, it's time we talk.  
After thirty years, you're finally ready to talk?  
When we were in Mom's office that day, you could have taken responsibility for what you did, but instead you stayed quiet and let Mom throw her whole career away.  
Mom didn't throw her career away. She retired the next year. She was a hero.         
You think she wanted to retire? She was so guilt-ridden about what she did to protect you, she didn't feel worthy of her badge.  
Look, I admit that I was not a perfect kid and I've made some mistakes in the past, but-                
You made some mistakes?     
Lin, Mom and I already talked about this years ago and worked things out. If you had gotten together with us like we'd asked, you would know that I'm a different person now. I've been a different person for a long time.        
You think just because you live in a big, fancy house and have a chef who cooks you fancy food, that you're a different person? Maybe you can fool everyone else, but you can't fool me. I see right through you.    
You know what, Lin? You're the one who hasn't changed. You're still a bitter loner who only cares about herself. No wonder Tenzin ended things with you years ago.       
Okay, I guess this is how it's going to be.  
Should I stop them?    
You don't have any siblings. Fighting is all part of the healing process.
Go, Mom!       
My sculpture!  
Actually, it looks kind of better now.
You got it out of your system?       
Not quite yet!        
What are you two doing?! You're sisters! Why would you want to hurt each other?       
Uh... who's gonna knock?    
Oh! No, no, no, no, no, no. Not me.  You're the Avatar. Why can't you do it?      
Uh, I can. But I just thought that you-             
I'll do it.  Uh, Chief, you've been sleeping for sixteen hours. We just wanted to make sure that you're okay.              
Good morning.     
What's this?          
I call it the kalenutsco. It's a mixture of kale, coconut water, and walnuts.  
Not bad. 
Opal, don't go. 
Please, sit down. I want to talk to you.   
Look, I'm just not really comfortable talking about these kinds of things, and, well... I wanted to say I'm sorry about the other night.     
It's okay.          
Your mother and I have a complicated relationship and-
It's probably difficult for you to be here.       
You're a smart young woman and an excellent airbender. I think it would be a wonderful opportunity for you to train with the other airbenders at the Northern Air Temple. 
There's a part of me that wants to go, but I don't want to upset my Mom.        
When I was younger, all I wanted to do was please my mother. I became a Police Chief because I thought it would make her happy,  but it didn't. You need to make decisions based on what you want. Don't make the same mistakes I did.
Mom? Dad?  Can I talk to you? 
Opal has decided to go to the Northern Air Temple. I'm guessing you had something to do with her decision.    
Well, I was just-     
It's okay.  I'm glad she was honest with me. I want her to do what makes her happy.  Mom gave us too much freedom, but I feel like I've made the mistake of giving Opal too little. I think it's time I let her choose her own way.  I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time when we were younger. I can't imagine what my life would've been like if Mom hadn't sent me away, if I had stayed in the city.  
You'd probably be in prison.              
You're probably right. Mako told me that you're an excellent Police Chief. Republic City is lucky to have you. I know Mom is proud. 
Can we move on? I'd love for you to be a part of my life again. There's plenty of space for you in the house,  and the kids would love having their aunt around.  I do need a co-director for my new dance performance.  
Whoa.  Slow down.  How about for now, I just promise not to show up at your house and attack you again.          
Deal.  
She could be anywhere.  
She's with The Metal Clan.  
Don't worry, I'll catch him!
Give it back, you dirty thief!
Hey! I stole that fair and square! 
Ow!  Stop it!  Okay, you win!
Your purse...  ma'am.
Two yuans, seriously?!  I risked my life for you!  As far as you know. 
Nice grab, little brother! 
Thanks!  Mmm... that tastes so much better than what we ate yesterday!
We didn't eat yesterday. 
Mmm, so much better...
Mako, you know who that is? It's Toza! Legendary earthbending captain of the Boar-q-pines! He's my hero! What do you think he's doing here? 
If you'd stop talking, we could hear.
Wow, I'm going to hate to see Toza lose.  Even if he means to.
Why? He got paid.  You didn't see any probenders crying for us  when mom and dad died and we got dumped on the street.  Life is hard; you either hustle or get hustled. 
Don't worry bro, we'll do fine. 
Mr Fang! Hey,  you wanna bet on the fight tonight?
What?  You're going to turn him into a snake snack? Wait, I'll buy him!  How much? 
No. The last thing we need is one more mouth to feed.
But it's such a tiny mouth! Pleeeaaase? We can't just leave him for snake food! 
Bolin, you have to toughen up!  Big animals eat the little animals, that's just how it goes.  How much do you want to put on the match tonight,  Mr Fang? 
Hey!  Toza! 
Oh...  you're the kid  that works with the Triple Threats. What, does Shady Shin want me to belly flop into the pool?  So I'm extra humiliated tonight? 
I just wanted to say, you don't have to throw the fight. I mean,  you're the best! 
I was the best. Now my body and my bank account are exactly the same; broke.  I made my decision,  leave me alone!
What are you doing?  Are you trying to get us into trouble with Shady Shin? 
No, I just-  Maybe I'm not as mean as you!  Maybe I just can't turn my back on people when they're down!
whispers Little Fire Ferret...  Hellooo...  I got ya,  buddy.  Oh, looks like that snake  wasn't hungry after all,  huh? I wonder  where he-  AH!
You really  have a knack for getting into stupid situations, you know that? 
Yeah, thanks Mako. 
C'mon, we should get out of here. 
No,  not... without him. 
Alright,  but his food comes out  of your half.
Hooray!  You're with us now, Pabu!  I named him Pabu. 
How did you come up with that?
I dunno,  just kinda came to me when the snake was crushing me.  Oxygen deprivation gives you some good ideas.
