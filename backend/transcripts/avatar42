Act I

(The episode opens with a shot of the waxing moon hovering in the night sky, almost full. Cut to a shot of a field of red flowers. A single, large mountain is seen in the background underneath the bright moon. Cut to a shot of Appa fast asleep inside a cave. The camera pans right to Aang and his friends gathered around a campfire underneath a gnarled and twisted tree. Cut to a close up of Sokka.)

Sokka: Suddenly, they heard something down the hall, in the dark. Oooh... It came into the torchlight. And they knew the blade of Wing - Fun was haunted! Aah-ah...

(Sokka dramatically pulls his sword out and wails in an attempt to be scary. Aang, Katara, and Toph are unimpressed.)

Aang: I think I liked "the man with a sword for a hand" better.
Toph: Water Tribe slumber parties must stink.
Katara: No, wait, I've got one, and this is a true Southern Water Tribe story.
Sokka: Is this one of those "a friend of my cousin knew some guy that this happened to" stories?
Katara: No, it happened to Mom. (everyone focuses their attention on her) One winter, when Mom was a girl, a snowstorm buried the whole village for weeks. A month later, Mom realized she hadn't seen her friend Nini since the storm. So mom and some others went to check on Nini's family. When they got there, no one was home, just a fire flickering in the fireplace. While the men went out to search, Mom stayed in the house. When she was alone, she heard a voice, (little girl's voice) "It's so cold and I can't get warm." Mom turned and saw Nini standing by the fire. She was blue, like she was frozen. Mom ran outside for help, but... when every one came back, Nini was gone.

(Aang wraps Momo's ears around his head nervously. The camera pans left to Sokka, who is hiding behind a tree trunk and peering over.)

Sokka: Where'd she go? 
Katara: No one knows. Nini's house stands empty to this day. But sometimes, people see smoke coming up from the chimney, like little Nini is still trying to get warm.

(The camera zooms out from a shot of the gang huddled around the fire, looking through the twisted tree limbs. Ominous music is heard in the background. Cut to a close up of Toph. She gasps and places a hand to the ground.)

Toph: Wait. Guys, did you hear that? I hear people under the mountain, and they're screaming.

(Aang, Katara, Momo, and Sokka all hug each other, trembling with fear. Sokka soon regains his composure.)

Sokka: Pft, nice try.

(Cut back to the shot looking through the tree limbs.)

Toph: No, I'm serious, I hear something.
Katara: You're probably just jumpy from the ghost stories.
Toph: It just stopped.
Aang: All right, now I'm getting scared.
Old Woman: Hello, children. (Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Momo all scream and run off, revealing her. They all gather around and hug Toph. She walks into the fire's light) Sorry to frighten you, my name is Hama. You children shouldn't be out in the forest by yourselves at night. I have an inn nearby, why don't you come back there for some spiced tea and warm beds?

(The camera pans across the faces of the group, stopping at Sokka.)

Sokka: Yes, please.

(Hama smiles and walks away. The scene shifts to a shot of several houses situated on a steep slope. The camera tilts up to an old in at the top of the slope. Cut to a close up of a small cup being filled with hot water. Cut to a panning right shot of everyone gathered around a square table under a single lit lamp in the dining room. They all have cups of tea, and Hama is pouring Katara's.)

Katara: Thanks for letting us stay here tonight. You have a lovely inn.
Hama: Aren't you sweet? You know, you should be careful. People have been disappearing in those woods you were camping in.
Sokka: What do you mean, disappearing?
Hama: (ominously) When the moon turns full, people walk in, and they don't come out. (cheerfully) Who wants more tea? (she frowns. The camera pans across the table, showing the fearful expression the kids all have) Don't worry; you'll all be completely safe here. Why don't I show you to your rooms, and you can get a good night's rest?

(The scene shifts to Sokka's room and zooms in on him lying in his bed. Momo is asleep on the floor. The creaking of old trees is heard outside. Cut to a close up of Sokka rolling over, unable to fall asleep. He shuts his eyes, but opens them in terror when he hears a high pitched squeak from inside. Sokka grabs his sword and quickly sits up, drawing it. Momo chirps and hides under his covers. He looks around, but nothing is there, so he sheathes his sword.)

Sokka: I know Momo, this place is creepy. I don't know if I'm gonna be able to fall asleep.

(Sokka pulls the covers up to his eyes and looks left and right nervously. The screen slides upward like a roll of film and transitions to a shot of Sokka fast asleep, snoring and drooling. Cut to the wide shot of the room and pan right. The scene fades to morning and Sokka is now lying over the side of his bed on the floor. Cut to an upside down close up of Sokka snoring. Someone walks up to him, casting their shadow over his face and waking him.)

Hama: Wakey-wakey. (Sokka wakes up and rubs his eyes. Cut to Sokka's perspective as she leans over him and smiles) Time to go shopping.

(Katara walks into Sokka's view, smiling happily. Cut back to the close up of Sokka. The camera turns counter-clockwise and fades to a similar close up of Sokka dressed and carrying grocery bags with his sword in the town market. The camera quickly zooms out to a close up of Hama handing three coins to a merchant. Cut to a shot of Hama and Katara walking away as the old merchant smiles and waves goodbye. Cut to a close up of Katara.)

Katara: That Mr. Yao seems to have a thing for you. Maybe we should go back and see if he'll give us some free komodo sausages.
Hama: You would have me use my feminine charms to take advantage of that poor man? I think you and I are going to get along swimmingly.

(Katara and Hama walk off camera and reveal a townsman talking to a different merchant.)

Townsman: You won't have any ash bananas till next week?
Merchant: Well, I have to send the boy to Hing-Wa Island to get them, and it's a two-day trip.
Townsman: Oh, right, tomorrow's the full moon.
Merchant: Exactly, I can't lose another delivery boy in the woods.

(Sokka, Aang, and Toph walk past the townsman and merchant, overhearing their conversation. 

Sokka: People disappearing in the woods, weird stuff during full moons... this just reeks of spirit world shenanigans.
Aang: I bet if we take a little walk around town, we'll find out what these people did to the environment to make the spirits mad.
Sokka: And then you can sew up this little mystery, lickety-split, Avatar-style.
Aang: Helping people...that's what I do.

(Cut to an overhead shot of the entire group. Hama stops and turns to Katara.)

Hama: Why don't you all take those things back to the inn? I just have to run a couple more errands. I'll be back in a little while.
Sokka: This is a mysterious little town you have here (looks right into Hama's face).

(Cut to an extreme close up of Hama.)

Hama: (cryptically and smiling) Mysterious town for mysterious children.

(Hama walks away. The camera zooms in on Sokka, who has an odd, confused expression. Cut to a shot of Hama's inn, then to the kitchen inside. Sokka places the wooden bucket of groceries on the table and the camera tilts up to him.)

Sokka: That Hama seems a little strange. Like she knows something, or she's hiding something.
Katara: That's ridiculous. She's a nice woman who took us in and gave us a place to stay. She kind of reminds me of Gran-Gran.
Sokka: But what did she mean by that comment, "mysterious children"?
Katara: (sarcastically) Gee, I don't know. Maybe because she found four strange kids, camping in the woods at night? Isn't that a little mysterious?
Sokka: I'm gonna take a look around.

(Sokka walks out of the kitchen and up a nearby flight of stairs. Katara, Aang, and Toph follow after.)

Katara: Sokka! Sokka, what are you doing? You can't just snoop around someone's house.
Sokka: It'll be fine.

(Sokka proceeds to open one of the doors upstairs and glances inside the dark room. It is only a simple bedroom and he closes the door back.)

Aang:She could be home any minute.
Katara: (nervous) Sokka, you're gonna get us all in trouble, and this is just plain rude.

(Sokka finds a cabinet in the wall and grabs the door handles, trying to open it, but they are stuck.)

Sokka: I'm not finished yet. [grunts] Come on...

(Sokka yanks the doors open. Cut to a close up of several marionettes falling forward, being held in place by their strings. They all yelp in surprise. Sokka jumps back and draws his sword at the puppets in fright, his back against the wall and sliding to the floor.)

Aang: Ok, that's pretty creepy.
Katara: (closes the doors) So... she's got a hobby. There's nothing weird about that. Sokka, you've looked enough. Hama will be back soon.

(Sokka makes his way up into the dark attic and tries to open a nearby door, but it is locked. The other three walk up the stairs and join him.)

Sokka: Just an ordinary, puppet-loving innkeeper, huh? Then why does she have a locked door up here?
Katara: (angry) Probably to keep people like you from snooping through her stuff.
Sokka: We'll see. (peers in through the keyhole. Cut to his perspective. The camera zooms in on a small chest, sitting in the light shining through the attic window) It's empty except for a little chest.
Toph: (excitedly) Maybe it's treasure.

(Sokka smiles gleefully at the thought of treasure. Aang and Katara frown at Toph. Sokka draws his sword and begins to pick the door's lock with its tip.)

Katara: Sokka, what are you doing? You're breaking into a private room.
Sokka: I have to see what's in there.

(There is a click and the door opens. Cut to a close up of the chest. The group can be seen walking up to it from behind.)

Aang: We shouldn't be doing this.

(Sokka reaches down and picks up the chest. He tries to open it, but the chest is locked.)

Sokka: Maybe there's a key here somewhere.
Toph: Oh, hand it over. 

(Sokka hands Toph the chest. She takes the armband made of space earth from her arm and bends it into the shape of a key. Toph pushes the key inside the chest's lock and begins turning it.)

Sokka: Come on, come on!
Toph: This isn't as easy it looks.

(Katara looks over Toph's shoulders, blinking nervously. The sound of a bell is added to her blinks for humorous effect.)

Aang: (nervous) Guys, I don't know about this.
Katara: This is crazy, I'm leaving.
Sokka: Suit yourself. Do it, Toph.

(Katara begins to walk away. Cut to a close up of the chest as a click is heard. Cut to a shot of Toph as she gives a thumb up to Sokka and Aang. Both gather around the chest and even Katara runs back to try and look inside. They all inadvertently push Toph to the side. Their cheeks are pressed together comically. The lid of the chest is slowly lifted until a voice is heard behind them)

Hama: I'll tell you what's in the box.

(Aang, Sokka, and Katara yell with fear and alarm. The four quickly turn around and Sokka hides the chest behind his back. Cut to a tilting up shot of Hama standing in the attic doorway as she walks forward. Cut to a shot of the kids. Sokka, Katara, and Aang look down with guilt as Sokka hands the chest to Hama. 

Cut to a shot from inside the chest as Hama opens it and reaches inside. Cut to a close up of Sokka's eyes, wide with fear and anticipation. Hama begins to lift the object from the chest. Cut to a shot of the four kids. They look up in fear as Hama lifts the object in front of the camera. The tension is lifted when the object is revealed to be nothing more than a simple blue comb made from whale bone. Hama smiles at them cheerfully.)

Sokka: (disbelief) An old comb?
Hama: It's my greatest treasure. It's the last thing I owned from growing up in the Southern Water Tribe.

(The camera zooms in on Sokka and Katara as a wave of shock goes through them. Fade to black, then commercial.)



Act II

(The episode returns to a shot of the kids staring at Hama in shock.)

Katara: You're from the Southern Water Tribe?
Hama: Just like you.
Katara: How did you know?
Hama: I heard you talking around your campfire.
Sokka: But why didn't you tell us?
Hama: I wanted to surprise you. I bought all this food today so I could fix you a big, Water Tribe dinner. Of course, I can't get all the ingredients I need here, but ocean kumquats are a lot like sea prunes, if you stew them long enough.
Aang: (grimaces in utter disgust) Great.
Katara: I knew I felt a bond with you right away.
Sokka: And I knew you were keeping a secret, so I guess we're both right. (Katara punches him in the arm) But I'm sorry we were sneaking around.
Hama: Apology accepted. Now let's get cooking.

(The scene cuts to the outside of the inn. It is night, and lights can be seen in the windows. The camera pans left as Aang runs outside to a small barn. Cut to the inside of the barn where Appa and Momo are staying. Aang opens the door and tosses a cabbage into Appa's mouth. Momo jumps to the ground and chirps furiously as Appa. Appa spits the cabbage out. Momo grabs the cabbage and carries it off screen.

Cut to a close up of Hama placing a bowl of soup on the table inside the inn. Cut to a panning right shot of everyone seated at the dinner table, empty bowls placed in front of them. Cut to a shot of Aang leaning over to Toph.)

Aang: I'd steer clear of the "sea prunes".
Toph: I thought they were ocean kumquats.
Aang: Close enough.
Hama: Who wants five-flavor soup?

(Aang, Katara, and Sokka raise their hands. Hama places her hand over the bowl of soup and bends the liquid out of it. With a flick of her fingers, Hama bends the soup into everyone's bowls, much to their amazement.)

Katara: You're a Waterbender! I've never met another Waterbender from our tribe.
Hama: (sadly) That's because the Fire Nation wiped them all out. I was the last one.
Sokka: So how did you end up out here?
Hama: I was stolen from my home. (fade to a flashback of a young Hama in the Southern Water Tribe) It was over 60 years ago when the raids started. 

(Hama walks over to a young Kana and they both giggle. Hama looks up as black snow begins to fall from the sky. Cut to Hama and Kana running up the steps to the top of the wall surrounding the village. The camera tilts up to reveal Fire Nation ships floating out in the water, and large fire balls flying towards the camera. Cut to an overhead shot of the village being bombarded. Cut to a close up of several firebenders marching away from the ships, ash and soot falling all around them. 

Cut to a shot of a firebender throwing fireballs in every direction. Villagers run away in fright, and another firebender runs onscreen behind him. A waterbender emerges from underneath the snow behind the firebender, encasing the firebender in the background in a pillar of ice and knocking the one in the foreground away with a trail of ice from the ground. A large net is thrown over the waterbender and he is dragged off screen.

Cut to a shot of Hama and several other waterbenders as they fight of the firebenders. To of the waterbenders behind her are captured by the nets. A net is thrown over Hama, but she cuts it in half with a blade of water.) 

Hama: (voice over) They came again and again, each time, rounding up more of our Waterbenders, and taking them captive. 

(Young Hama watches as the other waterbenders are dragged off towards the ships. Fade to a close up of Hama panting. The camera zooms out to a shot of her and several other waterbenders raising their arms upward. Cut to a far shot of a Fire Nation ship being pushed up and trapped by the ice underneath that Hama and the other waterbenders are bending. It is the same ship that Aang
and Katara explored in "The Boy in the Iceberg.")

Hama>: (voice over) We did our best to hold them off, but our numbers dwindled as the raids continued. 

(The waterbenders behind Hama fade and disappear until only Hama is left. Cut to a close up of Hama. The camera rotates around her and zooms out to show firebenders surrounding her. She lowers her hands in defeat. )

Hama: (voice over) Finally, I too was captured.

(Cut to an overhead shot of Hama surrounded by three large rings of firebenders. A Fire Nation flag flutters in the foreground. Cut to a shot of Hama being led up the steps of a Fire Nation ship, her hands shackled.)

Hama: (voice over) I was led away in chains. The last Waterbender of the Southern Water Tribe. 

(Cut to a shot of Hama standing at the top of the steps, flanked by the firebenders. The camera zooms out before cutting to a shot of young Kana, tears in her eyes, and a few other villagers looking back. Cut to a close up of a tears eyed Hama. A shadow passes over her. Cut to Hama's perspective as the stairs are pulled up. With a loud thud, the flash back ends and the scene shifts back to Hama in the present. The camera zooms out as Katara walks to Hama and puts her hands on Hama's shoulders consolingly.)

Hama: They put us in terrible prisons here in the Fire Nation. I was the only one who managed to escape.
Sokka: How did you get away? And why did you stay in the Fire Nation?
Hama: I'm sorry. It's too painful to talk about anymore.
Katara: We completely understand. We lost our mother in a raid.
Hama: (patting Katara's hand) Oh, you poor things.

(Aang and Sokka lower their heads solemnly)

Katara: I can't tell you what it means to meet you. It's an honor, you're a hero.
Hama: I never thought I'd meet another Southern Waterbender. I'd like to teach you what I know, so you can carry on the Southern Tradition when I'm gone.
Katara: (excitedly) Yes, yes of course! To learn about my heritage, it would mean everything to me.

(Cut to a close up of Hama and zoom in as she smiles. Cut to a shot of the town on the next day.)

Hama: (off screen) Growing up at the South Pole, Waterbenders are totally at home surrounded by snow and ice and seas. (the camera tilts down to Hama and Katara walking over a rocky hillside outside the village) But, as you probably noticed on your travels, that isn't the case wherever you go.
Katara: I know, when we were stranded in the desert, I felt like there was almost nothing I could do.
Hama: That's why you have to learn to control water wherever it exists.
Katara: I've even used my own sweat for waterbending.
Hama: That's very resourceful, Katara. You're thinking like a true master. But did you know you can even pull water out of thin air? (throws her hand out and creates a circle over her head, collecting the moisture in the
air) You've got to keep an open mind, Katara. (cut to a close up of the water forming around her fingers and turning into icicles) There's water in places you never think about.

(Hama swings her hand around behind her and throws the icicles. They lodge themselves into the trunk of a nearby tree with ease. Cut to a close up of Hama. The camera pans to the right slightly and zooms in on Katara standing behind her, looking on happily. Cut to a panning right shot of a river in the Fire Nation countryside from the top of a mountain. Aang comes into view.)

Aang: This has gotta be the nicest, natural setting in the Fire Nation. I don't see anything that would make a spirit mad around here.
Toph: Maybe the moon spirit just turned mean.

(Sokka takes a big whiff of some yellow flowers before turning to Toph.)

Sokka: (furious) The moon spirit is a gentle, loving lady. She rules the sky with compassion and... lunar goodness.

(A traveler walks down the nearby trail and Aang turns to him.)

Aang: Excuse me, sir. Can you tell us anything about the spirit that's been stealing people?
Traveling Townsman: Only one man ever saw it and lived, and that's Old Man Ding.
Toph: Where does Old Man Ding live?

(The scene shifts to Katara and Hama walking through the field of red flowers dotted with large rocks. The mountain can be seen in the distance.)

Katara: Wow, these flowers are beautiful.
Hama: They're called Fire Lilies. They only bloom a few weeks a year, but they're one of my favorite things about living here. And like all plants, and all living things, they're filled with water.
Katara: I met a Waterbender who lived in a swamp, and could control the vines by bending the water inside.
Hama: You can take it even further.

(Hama waves her hands in a large circle, being the water right out of the fire lilies surrounding her, making them dry, black and shriveled. Hama completes the circle and chops her hand downward at tall rock. The water hits the rock and passes through, cleanly slicing off four pieces.)

Katara: That was incredible. (stares down at the flowers sadly) It's a shame about the lilies, though.
Hama: They're just flowers. When you're a Waterbender in a strange land, you do what you must to survive. Tonight, I'll teach you the ultimate technique of Waterbending. It can only be done during the full moon, when your bending is at its peak.
Katara: But isn't that dangerous? I thought people have been disappearing around here during the full moon.
Hama: Oh, Katara. Two master Waterbenders beneath a full moon? I don't think we have anything to worry about.

(Katara and Hama begin walking away towards the forest. The camera tilts up and fades to an overhead shot of Aang, Sokka, and Toph walking through town at night. The camera tilts up to an old man at work on one of the small houses. Cut to a close up of the old man steadying his hammer as he holds a nail against a board.)

Aang: (off screen) Old Man Ding?

(The camera zooms out slightly. Old Man Ding glances back behind him just as he brings his hammer down on his thumb, causing him an immense amount of pain and to drop his hammer.)

Old Man Ding: Eeh, yeow! Aw, dang blame it! What? Can't you see I'm busy Got a full moon rising. And why does everyone call me that? I'm not that old. (crouches down to lift up a board, but is too weak) Aww... well, I'm young at heart. (Aang reaches down and helps him lift the board up to the window) Not ready to get snapped up by some moon monster, yet, at least.
Sokka: (takes the hammer and nail and proceeds to nail the board down) We wanted to ask you about that. 
Aang: Did you get a good look at the spirit that took you?
Old Man Ding: Didn't see no spirit. Just felt something come over me, like I was possessed. Forced me to start walking toward the mountain. (cut to a close up of Ding's finger pointing at the mountain) I tried to fight it, but I couldn't control my own limbs. (walks around a bit like he is possessed) It just about had me into a cave up there. And I looked up at the moon, for what I thought would be my last glimpse of light. But then, the sun started to rise. And I got control of myself again! I just high-tailed it away from that mountain as quick as I could!
Sokka: Why would a spirit want to take people to a mountain?
Toph: Oh, no! (she startles Aang and Sokka) I did hear people screaming under the mountain. The missing villagers must still be there.

(The camera zooms out from a shot of them all staring up at the mountain. Cut to commercial.)



Act III

(The show returns to a shot of Toph's feet running across the ground. She, Sokka, and Aang sprint through the woods until she stops and places a hand on the ground.)

Toph: I can hear them, they're this way.

(Toph, Aang, and Sokka all run towards the mountain. Cut to a close up of the full moon shining brightly in the sky. Cut to a far, overhead shot of Katara and Hama in the woods.)

Hama: Can you feel the power the full moon brings? (inhales deeply) For generations, it has blessed Waterbenders with its glow, allowing us to do incredible things. (Cut to a close up of her arm as she flexes her hand and as her veins begin to pop out. Cut to a shot of her staring at the moon, arms outstretched, then to an extreme close up of her face) I've never felt more alive.

(The scene cuts back to Toph, Aang, and Sokka making their way to the foot of the mountain. Cut to a shot from the inside of a cave as the three come to its mouth.)

Toph: This is the place.
Sokka: I can't see anything down there.
Toph: (takes Sokka's hand) That's why you have me, let's go.

(They all jump into the darkness of the cave. The camera zooms in, and the scene fades to darkness before returning to a shot of the inside of the cave. The camera pans right to a wall and metal doorway that are lit by two torches. Toph, Aang, and Sokka run up to it. Toph stops at the door, stomps her foot down behind her for support, and punches the door with both fists, knocking it off its hinges. They make their way further into the cave, Sokka and Aang lighting the way with the torches. Cut to their point of view as they enter a new chamber. They stop, and Sokka and Aang stare with shock as the torch light reveals dozens of men and women chained to the walls of the cave.) 

1st Male Prisoner: We're saved.

(The three enter the chamber. Toph takes her armband off and begins unlocking one person's shackles.)

Aang: I didn't know that spirits made prisons like this, who brought you here?
Female Prisoner: It was no spirit. 
2nd Male Prisoner: It was a witch.
Sokka: A witch, what do you mean?
Male Prisoner: She seems like a normal old woman, but she controls people like some dark puppetmaster.
Sokka: (angry) Hama!
1st Male Prisoner: Yes, the innkeeper.
Sokka: I knew there was something creepy about her. 
Aang: We have to stop Hama!
Toph: I'll get these people out of here, you go.

(Sokka gives one of the freed prisoners his torch before running with Aang. Cut to a shot of a cat-owl sitting on a tree branch, directly in front of the moon, hooting and swishing its tail before flying away. Cut to a panning right shot of Hama and Katara, their backs to the camera.)

Hama: What I'm about to show you, I discovered in that wretched, Fire Nation prison. (fade to a flashback of a close up of young Hama staring through the bars of a cell and looking down sadly)  The guards were always careful to keep any water away from us. They piped in dry air, and had us suspended away from the ground. 

(Cut to a panning right shot of the prison. The cells hang from chains, and there are pipes lining the walls. The guards stand on walkways between the cells.)

Hama: (voiceover) Before giving us any water, they would bind our hands and feet so we couldn't bend. Any sign of trouble was met with cruel retribution. 

(Cut to a shot of a guard holding a cup attached to a long pole up to Hama mouth. Her hands are chained and pulled up above her as she drinks the water. The scene flashes white and returns to the present to a shot of the full moon.)

Hama: And yet, each month, I felt the full moon enriching me with its energy. There had to be something I could do to escape. (fade back to young Hama in her cell, staring at the moon shining through the grate in the prison ceiling) Then I realized that where there is life, there is water. The rats that scurried across the floor of my cage, were nothing more than skins filled with liquid. (an elephant rat crawls over the chains and into her cell. She flexes her hand, and the rat stiffens) And I passed years developing the skills that would lead to my escape. (fade back to a close up of Hama in the present) Bloodbending. Controlling the water in another body. (Katara stares at her in horror) Enforcing your own will over theirs. (fade to the flashback to a shot of young Hama controlling five elephant rats with her hand) Once I had mastered the rats, I was ready for the men...

(Cut to a profile shot of a prison guard walking down the walkway. He suddenly stops and his body begins to jerk unnaturally. He watches with fright as his own hand moves on its own and grabs the keys at his belt and he is dragged forward. Cut to a shot of Hama pulling the guards in with her bending and forcing him to unlock her cell. Cut to a shot of the guard falling to the floor. Hama jumps out of her cell behind him.)

Hama: (voiceover) And during the next full moon, I walked free for the first time in decades. (the guard tries to get up, but Hama presses her hand down, forcing him back down. Hama walks away, her legs unsteady and wobbly from months of inactivity)  My cell unlocked by the very guards assigned to keep me in. (the scene flashes white and returns to a shot of Hama and Katara) Once you perfect this technique, you can control anything... or anyone.

Katara: (uneasy) But, to reach inside someone and control them? I don't know if I want that kind of power.
Hama: The choice is not yours. The power exists...and it's your duty to use the gifts you've been given to win this war. Katara, they tried to wipe us out, our entire culture... your mother!
Katara: I know.
Hama: Then you should understand what I'm talking about. We're the last Waterbenders of the Southern Tribe. We have to fight these people whenever we can. Wherever they are, with any means necessary!
Katara: It's you. You're the one who's making people disappear during the full moons.
Hama: They threw me in prison to rot, along with my brothers and sisters. They deserve the same. You must carry on my work.
Katara: (defiant) I won't! I won't use bloodbending, and I won't allow you to keep terrorizing this town.

(Katara points her finger at Hama, but her arms twists to one side, then the other side, and behind her back. Katara grabs her arm and tries to stop it.)

Hama: You should have learned the technique before you turned against me. (makes Katara stand straight up, stiff) It's impossible to fight your way out of my grip. I control every muscle, every vein in your body.

(Hama uses bloodbending to twist Katara's body around and throw her from side to side. Cut to Hama's point of view as she causes Katara's body to twitch and jerk erratically, her hands in the foreground. Cut to a close up of Hama as she slowly brings her hands down, smiling sadistically. Katara is forced down to her knees. Tears begin to form in her eyes.)

Katara: Stop...please.

(Hama cackles sinisterly. Cut to a shot of the full moon. Fade to a close up of Katara looking down, tears streaming down her face. Cut to a close up of her hands on the ground. She clenches her fists, and the grass around them shrivels and dies. Cut back to the close up of Katara as she lifts her eyes at Hama
in anger. Cut to Hama as her smile quickly fades and her laughter ends. Katara stands back up and takes a deep breath, lifting her hands.)

Katara: You're not the only one who draws power from the moon. My bending is more powerful than yours, Hama. Your technique is useless on me!

(Hama and Katara both enter their battle stances. Katara lifts her arms up and bends the water out of the grass and into a ring around her. She hops forward, spins once, and flings the water at Hama. Hama takes the water with her bending and redirects the attack back at Katara. Katara skillfully takes the water back, spins back around, and flings the water back again, countering the counter-attack. Hama extracts the water from two trees, creating two large torrents, and throws them forward before taking Katara's attack and flinging it back again. The three torrents all form one massive torrent of water and fly towards Katara. Katara steps back and presses her hand forward, blocking the attack. The scene goes into slow motion as the water is completely blocked, exploding into a spectacular shower of droplets. Cut to a close up Katara, the droplets reflecting her eyes, then to Hama, the droplets reflecting her shock and fear. 

The scene goes back to full speed as Katara dashes forward and circles her arms inward. The water hanging in the air is bent into two torrents, one hitting Hama head, the other her feet, spinning her in mid air like a yin-yang and knocking her down as she yells. Hama slowly rises up as Sokka and Aang run into the area.)

Sokka: We know what you've been doing, Hama!
Aang: Give up, you're outnumbered.
Hama: No. You've outnumbered yourselves.

(Hama raises both arms and Aang and Sokka's bodies stiffen. Hama flings them at Katara. Katara leaps between the two, dodging them, gathers more water from the grass and flings it at Hama as she rises. Hama extracts the water from another tree and creates a massive spinning wheel of water in front of her body to forcibly block the attack. Katara is ready for more when Sokka comes at her with his sword.)

Sokka: Katara, look out! It's like my brain has a mind of its own. Stop it, arm, stop it!

(Hama waves her arms to the side, controlling Sokka and making Katara back away. Katara extracts more water from the grass and knocks Sokka away with it. Aang is then controlled at is forced to attack Katara.)

Aang: This feels weird.

(Katara smashes the water hard into Aang, knocking him into a tree. Katara throws the water at Aang and freezes it, pinning him to the tree.)

Katara: I'm sorry, Aang.
Aang: (off screen) It's ok.

(Hama bloodbends Sokka to attack again. Cut to a close up of Sokka swinging
his sword, his face full of fear. Katara quickly extracts the water from a sapling and flings it at Sokka's sword arm. He is sent flying back and hits a tree. Katara freezes the water and pins him there. Cut to a close up of Hama.)

Hama: Don't hurt your friends, Katara... and don't let them hurt each other.

(The camera zooms out to a shot of Hama with her arms outstretched. She lowers her stance and pulls her arms in. Aang and Sokka are both pulled off the trees, and are sent flying towards each other. Sokka's sword is pointed forward intended to impale Aang. Both of them scream in terror. Cut to a close up of Katara.)

Katara: No!

(Sokka and Aang both stop just before the sword can pierce the airbender. Both stare at their hands, realizing they have control again. They look to Hama, who stiffens and twitches, full of fear. Cut to a close up of Katara, her hands stretched outward, bloodbending Hama. Katara is shocked at first, then slowly brings her hands down, forcing Hama to her knees. Hama struggles to get back up, but glances back when Toph and the prisoners arrive. The scene cuts to a close up of Hama's hands being bound by shackles. The camera quickly zooms out to a shout of everyone surrounding her.)

1st Prisoner: You're going to be locked away forever.

(Two of the prisoners begin to lead Hama away.)

Hama: My work is done. (cut to a close up as she turns her head to Katara) Congratulations, Katara. You're a bloodbender.

(Cut to and zoom in on Katara as she puts a hand to her mouth and slowly begins to cry. Cut back to Hama as she begins to laugh with evil. The prisoners take her away and Katara drops to her knees. Cut to a shot of Katara sobbing, with Aang and Sokka resting their hands on her shoulder to comfort her. Their backs are to the camera, and it zooms in on the full moon hanging overhead.)
