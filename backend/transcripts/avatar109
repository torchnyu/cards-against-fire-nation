["Previously on The Legend of Korra" sequence, including clips from "Darkness Falls."]

Shiro Shinobi: After fusing with Vaatu, Unalaq became a Dark Avatar and ripped Korra and Raava apart. By destroying Raava, Unalaq and Vaatu transformed into the most powerful dark spirit that's ever lived. Tenzin managed to free Jinora from The Fog of Lost Souls, but her spiritual quest isn't over yet. Can anyone save the world from eternal darkness?



Act I

(Fade into an extreme wide, high establishing shot of Republic City at night. Police airships fly above it and battleships are lined up in the bay to defend the city. An aurora fills the sky above, creating a twilight that illuminates the entire area. Cut to a shot of the temple on Air Temple Island, then cut to Ikki, Meela, and Pema holding a sleeping Rohan as they stare out over the balcony from the top floor.)

Ikki: Ooh. Pretty.

(Cut to a shot of President Raiko and Lin Beifong on the front deck of an police airship as Raiko speaks into a radio.)

Raiko: General Iroh, Are your ships in position?
General Iroh: (over the radio) Yes, Mr. President, but I need to know what kind of enemy we're dealing with.

(Cut to a shot of the airship flying away from the camera as a purple streak of light flies into view. It stops in midair, and the light grows brighter and more intense until it explodes, and we see UnaVaatu come flying towards the camera. Cut to a wide shot of the bay as UnaVaatu rockets down like a comet into the water, creating a huge splash. Cut to a close up of UnaVaatu and zoom out as the water falls around him and he stands up.)

UnaVaatu: It's time to take back the Physical World.

(Cut to a high wide overhead shot of UnaVaatu walking towards the ships. Cut to General Iroh in one of the ships as he looks out at UnaVaatu.)

General Iroh: Fire!

(The battleships fire their cannons at UnaVaatu. Cut to a shot of UnaVaatu as he continues to walk forward, not even reacting to the cannon fire. UnaVaatu stops, and raises his arms up to create a huge wave. He throws his arms down and sends the wave of water at the battleships. The ship crews yell and grunt as the wave hits the ships and knocks them way. UnaVaatu looks up and begins walking to one side. Cut to an over the shoulder shot of Pema, Meelo, and Ikki looking out over the bay as UnaVaatu walks towards the statue of Aang.)

Meelo: Monster attack!

(Cut to a low angle shot as UnaVaatu grabs the statue with both hands and tendrils. He grunts and begins to pull, then throws Aang's statue down into the water, creating a huge splash. Cut to a shot of the statue's face in the water, then dissolve into a shot of Korra in the same position on the ground, eyes closed. A shadow falls over her and we hear Tenzin.)

Tenzin: They're over here! (cut to a shot of Tenzin, Kya, and Bumi kneeling down to the unconscious Korra, Mako, and Bolin) Please, wake up. (picks Korra up while Kya examines Mako)
Kya: They're going to be all right, but I need to get them into some spirit water right away.

(Bumi picks up Mako by the armpits, and we dissolve to a shot of the spirit portal's energy as Tenzin, Bumi, and Kya exit it carrying Korra, Mako and Bolin. Cut to an overhead shot of Tenzin laying Korra down in one of the streams of the spirit world. Cut to a wider shot to see Mako and Bolin also in the stream. Tenzin gets out of the water, and we cut to a close shot of Kya as she begins to waves her arms and waterbend. Cut to an overhead shot of Korra, Mako, and Bolin as some of the water glows and passes back and forth over them. Cut to a close up of Korra's profile as she opens her eyes and lets out a gasp as she sits up. Mako and Bolin soon follow, and they all gasp for air and look deathly frightened.)

Tenzin: Thank goodness you're all okay.
Korra: Did you find Jinora?
Tenzin: I was able to rescue her soul, but she wasn't ready to return to her body yet. She sensed the world was in grave danger.
Korra: She was right.
Tenzin: Were you able to stop Unalaq and Vaatu?
Korra: No, they fused, then Vaatu ripped Raava right out of me and destroyed her. Vaatu won.
Bolin: No! I'm too young to live through 10,000 years of darkness! Korra, can't you talk to one of your past lives or something?
Korra: When Vaatu destroyed Raava, he destroyed my connection to the past Avatars too.
Tenzin: If that's true, then-
Korra: The cycle is over. I'm the last Avatar. (tears rolls down her cheek) I'm so sorry, Tenzin.

(Korra begins to cry, and the camera pans across her friends looking at her with worry and concern, settling on Kya and Tenzin.)

Kya: She needs you now, more than ever.

(Cut to a low angle shot of UnaVaatu as planes fly overhead. He looks up and grabs one with his tendrils. The pilot ejects and parachutes just before UnaVaatu smashes the plane into the water below, causing it to explode. Cut to Chief Lin and President Raiko looking down at UnaVaatu from inside an airship.)

Raiko: It's going to destroy the entire city.

(Cut to a high close up of UnaVaatu as he looks up at the airship. He proceeds to power up, his red markings turning purple, and he fires a huge energy beam from his chest at the airship. The beam hits the tail of the airship and it creates a fire as the ship begins falling towards the city, turning in circles. Cut to police inside holding on to the rails as the alarm sounds. Cut to a close up of Lin's hand pulling a lever, then cut to the ship's ramp opening up behind her.)

Lin: We're going down.

(The police jump out of the falling airship and use their wires to swing to safety. Cut to Raiko holding onto Lin before she also shoots out her wire. It wraps around a stone dragon head on the roof of a building, and she swings off with Raiko. She and Raiko land and slide over a roof, destroying the tiles and stopping just at the edge as the airship falls behind them. Lin stands and Raiko is laying on his side as the camera cuts to an over the shoulder shot of them looking over the city and at UnaVaatu in the bay. Cut to UnaVaatu as he swings his arms to the side, then thrusts his fingers down at the water in front of him. His tendrils shoot from his arms and into the water and ground below. Cut to a high, wide shot of the city docks as the trendrils erupt from the water and cover the area, turning into vines. Cut to the city's brightly lit Harmony Tower and tilt up as the vines wrap around it. Quickly cut to Varrick feet as he is touching his toes. Cut to an establishing shot of him and Zhu Li reading a book in his cell as they listen to the radio.)

Shiro Shinobi: (from the radio) It's pandemonium in the streets, giant vines are destroying everything! This is Shiro Shinobi signing off-AAHH!

(Just as Shiro screams, vines burst through the cell wall and knock the radio over, as well as Zhu Li. Varrick looks up curiously from his toe touch. Cut to a shot of the outside wall broken by the vines as Varrick pokes his head out. In the distance, UnaVaatu can be seen . Varrick steps out and looks at the giant dark spirit. He takes out a pair of goggles and puts them on.)

Varrick: Zhu Li, commence operation "Winged Freedom"!

(Cut to Zhu Li wearing a large, rectangular backpack with wooden handles sticking from the top to the sides. She runs over to Varrick and jumps on his back, wrapping her legs around his waist and strapping the harness around him. Varrick jumps out, and they begin sky diving off the side of the building.)

Varrick: Do the thing!

(Cut to  close up of the backpack opening up and sprouting mechanical wings. Varrick and Zhu Li's descent is slown down, and they begin to glide away. Cut to Korra and her friends in the Spirit World as Tenzin walks up to her sitting on a rock.)

Tenzin: The other Avatars may not be able to help you anymore, but perhaps I can.
Korra: No one can help me now.
Tenzin: I know I haven't been the best mentor to you, but I realized it was because I had a lot of spiritual growth to do myself. There may still be a way for you to stop Vaatu.
Korra: How?
Tenzin: (kneels down) Let go of your attachment to who you think you are, and connect with your inner spirit.
Korra: Haven't you heard anything I said? Raava is gone. I'm not connected to a spirit anymore.
Tenzin: I'm not talking about Raava. Raava is not who you are. Come with me, I need to show you something.

(Tenzin walks behind Korra and she turns to look. Cut to a high overhead shot looking through the branches of the giant tree down at Korra and Tenzin walking towards it.)

Korra: Why are you showing me Vaatu's prison?
Tenzin: Because this tree had a history long before it held Vaatu. This is the Tree of Time, and the legends say that its roots bind the Spirit and Physical Worlds together.
Korra: And you think this tree can help me somehow?
Tenzin: Yes. I have read that long ago, the ancients would meditate beneath this tree, and connect with the great cosmic energy of the universe.

(Tenzin steps forward and jumps up the the edge of the hollow part of the tree, then joined by Korra. The look inside, and images appear at the back of the tree as Korra walks inside. They show past events from Korra's life, using clips from previous episodes.)

Korra: These are my memories.
Tenzin: The Tree of Time remembers all. Korra, the most powerful thing about you is not the spirit of Raava, but your own inner spirit. You have always been strong, unyielding, and fearless.

(The images merge and show Wan when he was young.)

Korra: Avatar Wan.
Tenzin: Before he fused with Raava, Wan was just a regular person.
Korra: But he was brave and smart and always wanted to defend the helpless.
Tenzin: That's right. (the image shows Wan feeding his animal friends, then him doing firebending to protect the spirits, and then the spirits rejoicing around him) He became a legend because of who he was, not what he was. He wasn't defined by Raava any more than you are.

(An image forms behind them and they look to see UnaVaatu throwing Aang's statue down, making Korra gasp.)

Korra: Everyone in Republic City is in danger!
Tenzin: You have to help them, Korra.
Korra: How? They're halfway around the world.
Tenzin: Do as the ancients once did, connect to the cosmic energy of the universe. Don't bend the elements, but the energy within yourself.
Korra: You really think I can do this?
Tenzin: I have no doubt.

(Korra gives Tenzin a hug, and he hugs her back.)

Korra: Thank you for not giving up on me.
Tenzin: I'm proud of you.

(Tenzin turns and begins to leave. He turns for one last look at Korra as she sits down in the center of the tree and begins to meditate. There is a blue glow above her, and we cut to a shot looking at Korra's back as Tenzin exits the tree in the background. Cut to a low angle close up of Korra and tilt up to an image above her, showing Wan and Raava as Wan airbends.)

Wan: If you and Vaatu have the same fight every 10,000 years, why hasn't one of you destroyed the other?
Raava: He cannot destroy light any more than I can destroy darkness. One cannot exist without the other.

(Dissolve to a close up of Korra and slowly zoom in.)

Unalaq: (from Korra's memories) Find the light in the dark.

(The scene fades to white as the zoom quickens, and changes to the world within Korra's soul, the sky filled with stars. Tilt down to Korra standing on a path of light as she opens her eyes. She looks around and sees a giant form of her own spirit holding a ball of energy, just as Aang did in the past. Korra stares at it in awe for a moment before she puts on an expression of resolve and begins to walk towards it. Cut to an extreme wide shot of Korra walking on the path of light, looking like an aurora. Cut to a close shot of Korra's spirit, and tilt down to the ball of light as Korra enters it. It glows brighter, filling the screen with white light, and we cut back to Korra in the Tree of Time. She begins to glow bright blue, and her spirit exits from her body, starting to grow. Cut to outside the tree as Mako and Bolin and Bumi are waiting. They turn and see Korra's spirit exiting from the tree and becoming giant sized. Cut to a low angle shot as Korra towers above them, the arc of light from the portals above her. Cut to a high angle shot as everyone looks up at her with shock and awe. Cut to an extreme wide shot of Korra standing under the arc as she steps to the Southern Portal and reaches to the light. It glows, and Korra is sucked into it with arcs of electricity. Cut everyone else watching in disbelief.)

Bumi: Uh...what did you say to her, exactly?

(Cut to a shot of Korra flying through the sky and towards the camera. Cut to commercial.)



Act II

(Fade into an establishing shot of Republic City covered in vines as alarm sirens blare. Pan left to the bay and we see UnaVaatu with his tendril still drilled into the ground under the water. Cut to a closer shot of UnaVaatu as he looks up into the sky and sees a bright blue comet of light. It stops high in the sky above, and an explosion of light comes rocketing downward into the water. This creates a huge splash which knocks UnaVaatu over. Cut to a low angle close up of Korra as she stands up. Cut to a high angle shot of the giant glowing blue Korra in the bay, and pan right to the tower on Air Temple Island in the foreground. Cut to Pema, Ikki, Meelo, and Rohan watching.)

Ikki: Korra's back!
Meelo: And she's a blue giant!

(Cut to a shot of the water as UnaVaatu's face rises from it as he stands back up. Cut to an extreme wide side shot as we see UnaVaatu prop himself up with tendrils from his back and face Korra. Cut to a low angle shot of UnaVaatu as his chest pattern glows bright. Korra waves her arms around and begins to power up. UnaVaatu fires his chest beam at Korra, and Korra fires a chest beam of her own back at him. The beams colide and create a shockwave, sending waves through the water. The beams push against each other, and Korra puts more power into hers. Korra beam pushes back against UnaVaatu's until he is overpowered, and the blue beam blasts him backward over the water. Korra begins to run toward UnaVaatu, and he looks up and throws his tendrils at her. Korra grabs two of the tendrils and pulls on them, pulling UnaVaatu off balance before Korra delivers a flying knee to his chin, then follows it up by reeling him in with all his tendrils, picking him up over her shoulders, and then tossing UnaVaatu into a cliffside. UnaVaatu has a brief moment to look up and sees Korra jumping at him, just before she delivers an powerful punch to his stomach that is strong enough to create a shockwave.

Korra places her hand over UnaVaatu's face and presses his head againt the cliff, while with her other hand points her fingers at the center of his chest, then gives it a palm strike which sends waves of gold light through his body. Cut to Korra looking confused and worried as UnaVaatu's tendrils rise behind her and wrap around her torso and wrists, pulling her away and snaring her as she struggles to become free.)

UnaVaatu: You are looking for something that is gone. Raava has been destroyed, and soon you will be too!

(Cut to an extreme wide shot as UnaVaatu fires a massive energy beam from his chest at Korra at point blank range. It begins as a purple sphere that grows until it erupts into a huge blast that pushes past Korra. Cut to a close up of Korra being hit by the beam, held by UnaVaatu's tendrils. The energy dissipates, and Korra hangs her head in fatigue. Cut to a wide shot as UnaVaatu drops Korra to her knees. Cut to an extreme wide high angle shot in the Spirit World as we see Korra's friends facing down a large swarm of dark spirits coming at them, with the Tree of Time in the foreground. Cut to a shot of the dark spirits roaring and snarling as they charge. Cut to a close up of Mako.)

Mako: They're coming for Korra!

(Mako steps forward and shoots lightning from his fingers, followed by Tenzin shooting a blast of air, Kya throwing a stream of water, and Bolin bending a wave of rocks all in succession. Cut to Korra and UnaVaatu as Korra stumbles backward in the water. UnaVaatu waves his arms, powers up, and releases another energy beam from his chest. Korra is violently blasted back by it and falls into the water, laying there unconscious. UnaVaatu waves his arms again and begins to waterbend a double helix of water around Korra. She is lifted up by it, and she and the water begin turning purple, starting from her feet and spreading upward towards her head. The scene cuts as just as it reaches Korra neck, and we return to the group in the Spirit World fighting the dark spirits. Tenzin leaps backwards towards the base of the tree where everyone is fending off the spirits, who pressure them with a relentless assault. Cut to Bolin throwing large rocks and grunting. After he does a kick, we cut to a close up of Bolin's foot as a dark spirit's tendril wraps around his ankle and starts dragging him in.)

Bolin: Heeeeeelp!

(The spirit is hit by a stream of water and disappears, letting go of Bolin. Cut to a shot showing Eska and Desna leaping to Bolin's defense and protecting him from a snake spirit about to strike him. They destroy it, and each throws a blade of water that cuts down more spirits.)

Eska: Leave my Bolin alone!
Desna: I am so done with spirits.
Bolin: Eska! I love you! (kisses her cheek, then takes a fighting stance between the twins, stomping his foot and summoning a rock in front of him) Let's face the end of the world together!
Eska: You're so romantic.

(The three of them each throw an attack at the camera, and we cut to an extreme high angle shot of UnaVaatu and Korra. Cut to the purple energy still spreading towards Korra's head.)

UnaVaatu: With you out of the way, I will be the one true Avatar.

(There is a brief silence as we cut to a low angle shot and see a ball of light descend between them. Cut to a shot looking through a telescope lens as we see Jinora inside the ball of light as it pulses. Cut to Ikki looking through the telescope with Meelo behind her.)

Ikki: Mommy, it's Jinora! She's... beautiful.
Pema: What? Let me see. (takes the telescope and looks through it, then gasps) Be careful, sweetie!

(Cut to a close up of Korra as Jinora floats in front of her, holding a ball of light in her hands. She opens her eyes and then spreads her arms, making the light spread. Cut to UnaVaatu as he holds his arms up to shield himself from the light as it encompasses him. Cut to a wide shot as the light continues to grow and illuminates the whole city until the screen goes white. Cut to the water around Korra falling as she falls back to her feet, cleansed. UnaVaatu looks up at her, then down at his chest as a small white light shines from inside him.)

UnaVaatu: No!
Korra: Raava!

(Korra rushes at UnaVaatu and punches him in the face, knocking him off balance. She then jabs her hand into his chest as though it were phasing through. Cut to a shot of Korra touching the light inside with her finger. It grows larger, as a group of smaller light particles, and Korra pulls the light out of UnaVaatu. Cut to a wide shot as Korra pulls Raava out and UnaVaatu falls to his hands and knees. Korra then begins to wave her arms and bends a double helix around UnaVaatu. He stands up and looks towards the sky as the water begins to glow with golden light. Gold light begins to form in his body, spreading upward, and we cut to a close up of UnaVaatu's face as it reaches his head.)

UnaVaatu: Nooo!!!

(Cut to a wide shot as UnaVaatu disintegrates into particles of gold light. Cut to a shot of the particles floating into the sky above, then to Korra as she finishes the ritual and places her fist against her palm.)

Korra: Go in peace.
Raava: Harmonic Convergence is nearly over. We must return to the Spirit World so we can fuse once again.  

(Raava and Jinora float down into Korra's hand, and she carefully covers them with her other hand. Cut to a wide shot as Korra bends her legs and glows before rocketing upwards into the aurora above, creating a splash. Cut to a shot of Mako grabbing Bolin's hand as he pulls his brother inside the Tree of Time. The swarm of dark spirits are pushing the group back as Tenzin covers Mako and Bolin. Mako shoots blasts of fire as well, but is knocked back by a dark spirit's tail. Tenzin jumps back inside the tree and continues to blast the spirits back with wind. The spirits are too numerous though, and they begin entering the tree, all of them blocking the only way out. Cut to an extreme wide shot of the area as a bright ball of light forms at the top of the portals' energy arc. A beam of light then shines down from it onto the tree, and we cut to a shot of the shining past the spirits closing in on the group, blinding the camera. Cut to an extreme wide shot as a shockwave of energy hits the ground and we see Korra appear. Cut to the entrance of the tree. The spirits are gone, and the group climbs up to the edge to see what is happening. Cut to a low angle shot as the camera tilts up to Korra. She opens her hands, and Jinora and Raava descend to the ground. Cut to Tenzin walking towards Jinora as she floats in the air.)

Jinora: I'll see you soon, Dad. 

(Tenzin reaches out for her, but Jinora vanishes. Cut to Korra's giant spirit form disintegrating, the particles flowing back into her physical body, and she opens her eyes. Cut to a close up of Jinora laying down in the healing pool. She opens her eyes, turns her head and smiles at Katara and Asami, who smile back at her in relief. Katara helps Jinora out of the water, and we see Tonraq and Senna nearby.)

Jinora: Gran-gran, I missed you. (hugs Katara)
Asami: What about Korra and the others?
Jinora: Don't worry, they're all right. Korra saved the world.

(Behind Jinora and Katara, Tonraq and Senna smile happily and hug each other, relieved. Cut back to a wide shot of the Tree of Time as everyone looks up at Korra walking out. Cut to Korra as she stares out at Raava. Raava then flies up into the air and in a spiral, and Korra jumps on her tail to ride. Cut to a shot looking upward within the spiral Raava creates with her body as she and Korra go up to the energy arc high above. Korra raises her hand up to the energy arc and it crackles with electricity. Cut to a wide shot as the whole arc is electrified and arcs of lightning shoot down from it to the center of the ground below. The top of the arc rises and splits, and the area becomes bright and snunny. Cut to a high angle shot of everyone else watching. Cut to a shot of the entire planet as the purple energy covering it disappears. Cut back to the portal beams straightening back up. There's a bright flash of light and it fades to show Korra glowing blue and with Raava's pattern on her body as she floats down. Cut to a profile shot of Tenzin.)

Tenzin: Her Avatar Spirit has returned.

(Cut to the wide establishing shot and slowly tilt down to the Tree of Time. Korra float down to the ground in front of the group on a gust of wind. She opens her eyes and they glow briefly.)

Korra: It's over.

(Cut to commercial break.)



Act III

(Fade into a shot of the Tree of Time and tilt down to Korra and the group. Mako, Tenzin, and Bolin run towards Korra.)

Bolin: Haha.

(Mako hugs Korra and kisses her cheek.)

Mako: I don't even know what to say. 
Tenzin: You were amazing.
Bolin: And the way you turned all gigantic like that, wow! I just wish Varrick had been here to film it, it would have been the greatest mover ever! After the Nuktuk Chronicles, of course.

(Korra frowns a moment and looks down sadly before she approaches Eska and Desna.)

Korra: I'm sorry about your father, but he was already fused with Vaatu. I couldn't save him.
Eska: It seems Cousin Korra is under the impression we are saddened by our father's demise.
Desna: But I will not miss him at all. In the end, he became a deplorable man.
Eska: Agreed, but how will we explain this to mother?

(Bolin approches Eska and Desna.)

Bolin: So I was thinking, I'm not really a fan of the long-distance relationship thing. So how about you move to Republic City with me?
Eska: I do not think that will be possible.
Bolin: (sighs) Okay, Desna can come too.
Eska: I will not be joining you, Bolin. Desna and I must return home.
Bolin: But you said-
Eska: Eternal darkness was upon us, I became caught up in the moment.
Bolin: Yeah. I guess I did too.
Eska: But... you will always hold a special place in the organ that pumps my blood. I will remember you fondly, (places a hand over her heart) my turtle-duck.

(Bolin smiles at Eska. Cut to Bumi, Mako, and Kya as Bum-Ju flies around Bumi.)

Bumi: Bum-Ju, you're okay! (hugs Bum-Ju) and I missed you, little buddy.

(Bumi holds Bum-Ju close to his chest, and we cut to a close up of Bum-Ju closing his eyes contently and chirping softly. Cut to Korra and Tenzin walking towards the Southern Portal.)

Tenzin: Now that you're bonded with Raava once again, are you also reconnected to your past lives?
Korra: (sadly) No. I think that link is gone forever.
Tenzin: I see. Why don't you close the portals and we'll go home.

(Korra nods and steps forward. She rises her hand towards the portal, and we cut to a close up of her hand as she hesitates.)

Korra: Maybe I shouldn't.
Tenzin: What do you mean?
Korra: What if Unalaq was right when he said the Avatar shouldn't be a bridge between the two worlds? (Bumi plays fetch with Bum-Ju) What if Avatar Wan made a mistake when he closed the portals? What if humans and spirits weren't meant to live apart? Well, what do you think I should do?
Tenzin: I think you should trust your instincts. There is nothing else I can teach you, you are the Avatar. Whatever your decision, I support you.

(Korra takes a moment to think. She looks to the portal, we cut to it and the camera tilts up. Dissolve to outside the Southern Portal at the South Pole where we see everything exiting. Cut to an establishing shot of the palace of the Southern Water Tribe. Cut to Mako approaching Korra from behind inside the palace hallway.)

Mako: Hey, can we talk?
Korra: Of course.
Mako: There's something I've been wanting to tell you about that fight we had. I know I said it wasn't that bad, but that's not exactly true. (Korra squints in confusion) I, um- I broke up with you.
Korra: I remember.
Mako: But I thought you said you lost part of your memory?
Korra: I did, but being inside The Tree of Time brought it back. I'm sorry for blowing up at you.
Mako: That's okay. (holds Korra's hand) I think we both said some things that we regret.
Korra: Why didn't you just tell me the truth in the first place?
Mako: I know I should have but... I didn't wanna hurt you all over again. I guess part of me wanted to forget about the breakup too.
Korra: I think we both know that this... Us... doesn't work.
Mako: You're right.
Korra: It's over. For real this time.

(Mako nods sadly. Korra cups his cheek in her hand and they kiss. Mako and Korra touch foreheads, eyes closed, and Korra sheds a tear before they part.)

Mako: I'll always love you, Korra.
Korra: And I'll always love you.

(Korra lets go and turns to walk away from Mako. Cut to a profile shot of Mako and we see Bolin slide into frame.)

Bolin: You want a hug? 

(Mako glances at Bolin and says nothing, then Bolin gives his brother a big hug. Cut to an establishing shot of the palace, and we see a crowd at the bottom of the steps. Korra and her friends and family stand at the top of the steps, Korra is at a podium addressing the people.)

Korra: The War of The Water Tribes is over. Unalaq has been defeated and the Northern fleet is returning home. The Water Tribes will always be allies, but the Southern Tribe is now independent! And the Southern Council of Elders has appointed my father, Tonraq, to be your new Chief! (the crowd cheers as Tonraq steps forward and waves) I've realized that even though we should learn from those who came before us, we must also forge our own path. So that is why I've decided to keep the portals open. (we see Bum-Ju on Bumi's shoulder and he chirps) Humans can now physically enter the Spirit World and spirits will be free to roam our world. I will no longer be the bridge. Humans and spirits must learn to live together. My mission will always be to use Raava's light spirit to guide the world toward peace and balance. Harmonic Convergence has caused a shift in the planet's energy, I can feel it. Things will never be the same again. We are entering a new age.

(Cut to a wide shot of the palace. The camera tilts up to the aurora in the sky, and we see various spirits flying above. Bum-Ju chirps and flies past the camera.)
