["Previously on The Legend of Korra" sequence, including clips from "The Revelation"]

Radio Broadcaster: (voice over) Benders be on alert! After coming face to face with Amon, leader of the Equalists, Avatar Korra discovers a terrifying truth: This masked madman has the ability to take away a person's bending, permanently! Benders of Republic City are counting on their young Avatar but is she prepared to face such a frightening foe?



Act I

(The episode opens with a shot of the moon shining brightly in a cloudy night sky. The camera zooms out and rotates until the open window of Korra's room comes into view, the shutters swaying in the breeze. Korra is asleep in bed. Cut to a shot of a shoji wall as light shines through the paper. Someone's shadow quickly darts across the paper doors. Korra wakes up with a start just before an Equalist chi blocker jumps in through the window. breaking the shutters. Korra looks startled, and two more chi blockers burst through the shoji doors. Korra leaps up and performs two spinning firebending kicks, which the chi blockers dodge. Korra follows up with two firebending punches, but misses as the chi blockers surround her. One jumps at Korra and kicks, but Korra blocks and counters with a barrage of fire punches. Another chi blocker closes in on Korra and executes a series of quick strikes up along her spine. Korra gives a yell and falls to her knees. Footsteps are heard approaching, and Korra looks up to see Amon standing above her)

Amon: After I take your bending away you will be nothing. 

(Amon reaches out towards Korra's face, her eyes wide with terror. The scene quickly fades to black, then cuts to Korra waking up from her nightmare with a scream, back in her room. She pants hard and beads of sweat are on her face. Korra looks to her right to see Naga licking her hand and laying her head on Korra's lap to comfort her. She strokes Naga's head.)

Korra: It's alright, Naga. I just had a bad dream.

(Korra lays her head on top of Naga's, and the scene cuts to an exterior shot of City Hall. The camera zooms in slowly.)

Tarrlok: (off camera) There is a madman running around our beloved city, (cut to the interior of City Hall where the five representatives, including Tenzin, are seated around the table.) threatening to tear it apart. We need to create a task force whose sole mission is to find Amon and bring him to justice. 
Tenzin: Absolutely not. A move that aggressive would only further divide benders and non-benders. 
Fire Nation Councilwoman: Tarrlok, I'm inclined to agree with your proposal, but, who would even head up such a task force? 
Tarrlok: (stands up and bows) It would be my honor and privilege to accept such a duty.
Tenzin: This is just another one of your ploys to gain more power, (thumps fist on table) isn't it? 
Tarrlok: All I'm trying to do is help. Think back, forty-two years ago Republic City was threatened by another dangerous man: Yakone. Your father wasn't afraid to deal with him head on. 
Tenzin: This is a completely different situation (points at Tarrlok and raises his voice) and how dare you compare yourself to Avatar Aang!
Tarrlok: Amon is not going to stop with the bending triads. Eventually he will come for all us benders, our friends, our families. Vote for this task force and I will stop Amon before it's too late. All in favor?

(Tarrlok raises his hand, and a moment after so do the other three councilmen and woman. Cut to a closeup of Tarrlok banging his gavel on the table. Tarlokk looks up at Tenzin and smirks, while Tenzin glares back at him. The sound of jazz music over the radio begins to play, and the scene cuts to an exterior shot of Tenzin's home on Airbender Island at night, with the full moon shining brightly. The camera tilts down to show Korra practicing her airbending moves while listening to a radio placed on a railing. Cut to a closer shot of Korra, and the radio begins to put out static for a second before Amon's voice is heard. Korra looks back in surprise.)

Amon: (through the radio) My fellow Equalists, (cut to a shot of the radio, zooming in slowly) this is your leader, Amon. (cut to a closer shot of Korra turning around, looking nervous) As you have heard, the Republic council has voted to make me public enemy number one, (cut back to the radio, zoomed in closer) proving once again that the bending oppressors of this city will stop at nothing to quash our revolution. (cut to a close up of Korra, then to a close up of the radio) But we can not be stopped. Our numbers grow stronger by the day. (cut to an extreme close up of Korra's eyes, looking frightened and with beads of sweat dripping down her skin) You no longer have to live in fear. The time has come for benders to experience fear. 

(Cut to a bird's-eye-view of Korra and the radio, and zoom out before cutting to an exterior shot of a factory at day time. The camera tilts down to show Mako walking away from the factory, throwing his scarf over his shoulder. A bell rings, and Mako stops. Cut to a shot over Mako's shoulder as he looks at a trolley car about to depart. He begins to run across the street after it. Cut to a close up of the bottom of a Moped as it speeds down the street. Cut to the rider's point of view as Mako runs out into the street. The rider, Asami, quickly turns the Moped and skids. Cut to a close up of Mako's reaction and quickly zoom in as he yells. The Moped collides with Mako and knocks him to the ground. The rider parks the Moped and runs over to Mako.)

Asami: Oh no! I'm so sorry! I didn't see you! 
Mako: (sitting up and rubbing his head) How could you not see me? I mean I was ju-juss-- (becomes lovestruck and blushes when Asami takes off her helmet and goggles, revealing her beautiful face as she flings her hair to the side) I was, I, I. Wow. I was, ahem. 
Asami: (reaching down to help Mako up) Are you okay? Did I hurt you? I am such an idiot. 
Mako: (brushing himself off) Don't worry, I'm fine. My brother hits me harder than that every day in practice. 
Asami: Wait, I recognize you. You're Mako, right? You play for the Fire Ferrets. 
Mako: Yeah, that's me. 
Asami: (covers her face and blushes) I am so embarrassed. (offers her hand to Mako and they shake) My name's Asami. Let me make this up to you somehow. Uh, how about I treat you to dinner? Tomorrow night, 8 o'clock, Kuang's Cuisine. 
Mako: Uh, Kuang's? I don't have any clothes nice enough for a place that classy. 
Asami: (putting her helmet and goggles back on s she walks to her Moped) I'll take care of that. All you need to do is show up. So, it's a date? 
Mako: Uh, yeah. I guess so. I'll see you tomorrow night. 

(Cut to a closeup of Asami's hand as she revs up her Moped. She drives off past Mako, and looks back at him to smile. As she rides away, Mako turns around, grinning and blushing with hearts floating around his head. The scene cuts to a shot of Airbender Island as the sun sets behind it. Cut to the dining room as Korra, Tenzin, and his family sit around the table with their dinner.)

Tenzin: We are grateful for this delicious food, for happiness, for compassion, and--
Tarrlok: (off camera) I'm not interrupting, am I?

(Tenzin looks surprised, and the camera pans to the left as Tenzin looks to the doorway to see Tarrlok standing there and bowing. Cut to a close up of Korra looking up from the table.)

Tenzin: (standing up)This is my home, Tarrlok. We're about to eat dinner. 
Tarrlok: Good because I am absolutely famished. Airbenders never turn away a hungry guest, am I right? 
Tenzin: (Sigh.) I suppose.

(Tenzin sits back down. Pema frowns at him and Tenzin shrugs in response.)

Tarrlok: (approaching Korra) Ahh, you must be the famous Avatar Korra. It is truly an honor. I am Councilman Tarrlok, representative from the Northern Water Tribe. 
Korra: (standing and bowing) Nice to meet you.

(Korra sits back down and Tarrlok sits down next to Korra. Ikki scoots close to Tarrlok.)

Ikki: Why do you have three pony-tails? (sniffs) And how come you smell like a lady? You're weird.
Tarrlok: Well aren't you... precocious. So, I've been reading all about your adventures in the papers. Infiltrating Amon's rally, now that took some real initiative. 
Korra: Oh, thanks. I think you're the first authority figure in the city who's happy I'm here. 
Tarrlok: Republic City is much better off now that you've arrived. 
Tenzin: Enough with the flattering, Tarrlok. What do you want from Korra? 
Tarrlok: Patience, Tenzin. I'm getting to that. As you may have heard, I am assembling a task force that will strike at the heart of the revolution and I want you to join me. 
Korra: Really?
Tenzin: What?
Tarrlok: I need someone who will help me attack Amon directly, someone who is fearless in the face of danger, and that someone is you. 
Korra: Join your task force? I can't.

(The camera zooms in on Tarrlok, looking surprised. Cut to Tenzin looking surprised as well. Cut to a close up of Korra and zoom in as she calmly drinks from her cup. Cut to black.)



Act II

(Fade in to an overhead shot of the dinner table. Korra is eating calmly.)

Tarrlok: I must admit, I'm rather surprised. I thought you'd jump at the chance to help me lead the charge against Amon. 
Tenzin: Me too.
Korra: I came to Republic City to finish my Avatar training with Tenzin. Right now I just need to focus on that. 
Tarrlok: Which is why this opportunity is perfect. You would get on the job experience while performing your Avatar duty for the city. 
Tenzin: Korra gave you her answer. It's time for you to go. 
Tarrlok: (standing up) Very well. But, I'm not giving up on you just yet. You'll be hearing from me soon. It has been a pleasure, Avatar Korra.

(Tarrlok begins to leave the room, and Ikki stands up to wave goodbye.)

Ikki: Bye-bye, Pony-tail Man!
Tarrlok: Hmph.

(Cut to an establishing shot of Kuang's restaurant, brightly lit up at night as a trolley passes by. Mako is stranding in front of it. Cut to a high angle shot of Mako looking up in awe of the establishment. He grabs the end of his scarf, then looks at the rest of his clothes, noting their poor condition. He sighs and walks inside. Cut to a close up of the butler.)

Butler: (gesturing widely and bowing down to the floor) Ah, welcome to Kuang's Cuisine, Master Mako.
Mako: Uh, master?

(The shot transitions to a shot of Mako and the butler in a room. Mako has his coat off as the butler pulls a clean shirt out from a box on the table. The camera position stays the same as a series of jump cuts show the butler dressing Mako in cleaner, more formal clothes and styling his hair. The shot transitions again to Mako's legs, and the camera tilts up to show off his new look, along with a sparkling sound effect. Mako takes a moment to admire himself before draping his scarf around his shoulders. The butler examines Mako for a second before reaching to take the scarf. Mako grabs his arm to stop him.)

Mako: (sternly) The scarf stays. 
Butler: (backing off and bowing to the floor) As you wish, sir. This way please.

(Mako follows the butler out. Cut to a shot of the dining area of the restaurant, with people seated at a table and being served. The camera pans to the left and zooms in on Mako and Asami sitting next to each other with drinks. Asami is now wearing a more formal dress.)

Asami: I am such a big pro-bending fan. I caught all of your matches this season. 
Mako: All of them? Wow. Honestly, there were a few I wish you hadn't seen. 
Asami: Oh don't be ridiculous. You're amazing! I can't wait to see you play in the tournament. 
Mako: (hesitantly) Yeah, well. Uhh. Maybe next year.
Asami: What do you mean? You made it in.
Mako: It just isn't in the cards for us right now. 
Asami: (placing her hand on Mako's) Tell me. What's the problem?
Mako: (sighs) We don't have the cash to ani-up for the championship pot. So, it looks like we're out of the running. 
Asami: That's not fair. 

(The server arrives with two silver platters.)

Server: Pardon me, Miss Sato. Your main course.

(The server takes the covers off the platters and leaves.)

Mako: Miss Sato? You wouldn't happen to be related to Hiroshi Sato, creator of the Satomobile?
Asami: Yeah, he's my dad.
Mako: (amazed) Get outta town!
Asami: I'm serious! You want to meet him?
Mako: Meet the most successful captain of industry in all of Republic City? Yeah, I'll take you up on that. 

(Cut to the courtyard of Airbender Island at sunset. The camera tilts down to show Korra sitting on a stoop, with Naga laying next to her on her back. Bolin is approaching them with Pabu on his shoulder. Cut to a closer shot of Bolin.)

Bolin: (singing) da, da da, cha, cha cha. Hello fellow teammate! 
Korra: (rubbing Naga's belly) Hey, Bolin. 
Bolin: Missed you at practice this week. 
Korra: Yeah, sorry about that. 
Bolin: Aww, that's alright. We're probably out of the tournament anyway unless some money miraculously drops out of the sky by tomorrow. Anyway, the reason I came by was to give you this. Ta-da!

(Bolin presents Korra with a rose and a cupcake with cherries on top. Pabu chirps and jumps off of Bolin.)

Korra: (taking the gifts) Wow, thanks. What's this for?
Bolin: (sarcastically) Uhh, I can't remember now. Oh, yeah, now I remember! You saved me from Amon.
Korra: Oh, that? It was no big deal.
Bolin: (getting excited) No big deal, are you serious? I was totally freaking out when he was coming at me with his creepy mask all, (imitating Amon and acting mock frightening.) "I will take away your bending forever!" (cut to a close up of Korra and zoom in as she looks worried) I mean that is scary stuff! I still can't sleep well. 
Korra: Mm-hmm.
Council Page: (off camera) Delivery for Avatar Korra! (cut to a shot of the page approaching with a large box of flowers and gifts and placing it by the stoop) Tarrlok sends his compliments and urges you to reconsider his offer. 
Korra: Tell him I haven't changed my mind.
Council Page: Mmm-hmm. 

(The page bows and leaves.)

Bolin: (angry) Who's this "Tarrlok" guy? Is he bothering you? Huh? 'Cause I can have a word with him.
Korra: Ha! No, it's not like that. He's just some old guy who works with Tenzin on the council. 
Bolin: Oh! Good. Good, that sounds better. I like that better. 

(The scene cuts to the interior of Sato's factory as a satomobile is assembled. The camera pans right to show Hiroshi Sato, Asami, and Mako on the factory floor between lines of satomobiles on conveyor belts.)

Hiroshi Sato: What do you think of my little operation here? 
Mako: It's very impressive, Mr. Sato. 
Hiroshi: Please, call me Hiroshi. So, I understand you're dirt poor.
Mako: Uh... Well.
Hiroshi: Young man, it is nothing to be ashamed of. I too came from humble beginnings. Why, when I was your age I was a mere shoe shiner and all I had to my name was an idea: the Satomobile. (cut to a close up of the hood ornament of a satomobile, then zoom out and pan around the staomobile) Now I was fortunate enough to meet someone who believed in me and my work ethic. He gave me the money I needed to get my idea off the ground. (the camera tilts up to show the rest of the factory as Hiroshi gestures to all of it) And I built the entire Future Industries Empire from that one, self-less loan. 
Asami: Dad, stop bragging! Just tell Mako the good news!
Hiroshi: Heh heh heh heh heh.
Mako: What good news?
Hiroshi: (placing a hand of Mako's shoulder) Well my daughter passionately told me all about your hard earned success in the Pro-Bending arena and about your team's current financial stumbling block. Now I hate to see you loose your chance at winning the championship just because you're short a few yuans. That's why I'm going to sponsor the Fire Ferrets in the tournament!
Mako: (shocked) Are you serious!?
Asami: He's serious! My dad's going to cover your ani for the championship pot.
Mako: That, that is good news! 
Hiroshi: There's just one catch. You all have to wear the Future Industries' logo on your uniforms.
Mako: I'll tattoo it on my chest if you want, Sir. (Asami and Hiroshi both chuckle. Mako shakes hands with them) Thank you both so much. I promise the Fire Ferrets will make the most of this opportunity. 

(The scene cuts to Tenzin on Airbender Island approaching a maroon convertible satomobile with a large pink ribbon tied around it, preseumably another gift from Tarrlok to Korra. Ikki and Meelo are sitting in it and pretending to drive.)

Ikki: Outta the way, Daddy! We're driving here! Beeeeeep! Beep beep beep!

(Tenzin shakes his head in disappointment at Tarrlok's efforts.)

Meelo: (quietly) Beep beep!

(Tenzin walks past and we cut to Korra practicing her airbending movements in the octogonal training area. Tenzin walks into frame.)

Tenzin: I see Tarrlok's gifts are getting more and more extravagant. 
Korra: Yeah. That guy doesn't know how to take "no" for an answer.
Tenzin: Korra, are you doing alright? 
Korra: Yeah, I'm fine. 
Tenzin: (sitting on the steps and offering Korra to sit next to him) Why don't you take a break? I'm glad you turned down Tarrlok but I just wanted to make sure your decision was for the right reason. 

(Korra walks over to Tenzin and sits beside him.)

Korra: I'm just really focused on my airbending right now, is all. 
Tenzin: Right. That's what you said. You know, it's okay to be scared. The whole city is frightened by what's been going on. The important thing is to talk about our fears because if we don't, they can throw us out of balance. (Korra looks to Tenzin a moment, then looks away. Tenzin stands up to leave) I'm always here for you if you want to talk. 

(The scene fades to a close up of Korra looking sad as she lounges on a railing in the evening. The voice of the council page catches her attention.)

Council Page: Avatar Korra, I have something for you.

(The council page approaches as Ikki and Jinora are playing Pai Sho on a table below. Korra hops down to the ground to confront the page.)

Korra: It doesn't matter how many gifts Tarrlok sends, I'm not joining his task force! 

(Korra uses earthbending to turn the page around, then kicks him in the butt to get him away.)

Council Page: It's not a gift! It's an invitation.
Korra: To what?
Council Page: (pulling out an invitation card) Tarrlok is throwing a gala in your honor. All of Republic City's movers and shakers will be there. The councilman humbly requests your attendance. 

(Korra takes the card and looks at it suspiciously. Background music begins to play, and then the scene cuts to an establishing shot in the evening of the building the gala is being held at. The camera tilts down to show large banners of Korra hanging on either side of the entrnce. Cut to a shot of Korra, Tenzin, nd Pema entering, dressed in formal wear as Ikki, Meelo, and Jinora run out ahead of them. Cut to an overhead shot of the partygoers clapping at Korra's arrival. Tenzin stays by Korra's side while Pema talks to someone in the crowd.)

Korra: I can't believe this is all for me. 
Tenzin: I'm not sure what Tarrlok's plotting but keep your guard up. It's not like him just to throw a party for the fun of it. 

(Tarrlok approaches the two of them from within the crowd.)

Tarrlok: So glad you could make it, Avatar Korra. If you'll excuse us, the city awaits it's hero. 

(Tarrlok gestures for Korra to follow him while Meelo runs past. Tenzin watches them go, and turns his head to see Meelo doing something off screen which fills him with comedic dread.)

Tenzin: Meelo, no! That is not a toilet! Oh, dear.

(Cut to Korra and Tarrlok, with Hiroshi Sato in the foreground.)

Tarrlok: Korra, it is my pleasure to introduce Republic City's most famous industrialist, Hiroshi Sato.
Korra: Nice to meet you.
Hiroshi: (bows) We're all expecting great things from you. 
Korra: (meekly) Right. Greatness. 
Mako: (off screen) Hey, Korra! 

(Korra looks up and pouts as Mako, Asami, and Bolin approach. Asami has her arm around Mako's.)

Hiroshi: This is my daughter, Asami.
Asami: It's lovely to meet you. Mako told me so much about you. 
Korra: Really, because he hasn't mentioned you at all. How did you two meet?
Bolin: (rushing in next to Korra) Asami crashed into him on her Moped. (rushes off screen)
Korra: What? Are you okay? 
Mako: I'm fine. More than fine. Mr. Sato agreed to sponsor our team. We're back in the tournament. 
Bolin: (putting an arm around Mako's shoulder) Isn't that great?!
Korra: (meekly) Yeah, terrific. 

(Korra looks off to the side. Chief Beifong walks by and Tarrlok gestures to her to come over.)

Tarrlok: Chief Beifong! I believe you and Avatar Korra have already met. 
Chief Beifong: Just because the city's throwing you this big to-do don't think you're something special. You've done absolutely nothing to deserve this. 

(Beifong leaves and Korra glares after her. Cut to a close up of Korra as she looks down glumly from being reminded of the truth. The scene fades to a shot of Korra and Tarrlok walking in from offscreen to the top of a large stairway. The camera quickly zoom out to show several journalists waiting for her at the bottom. They all quickly approach and begin asking questions and taking pictures. Tenzin notices and looks worried.)

Journalists: Hello! I've got this! One more question, Miss! I think if we could -- Hold up! Hold up!
Tarrlok: If you'd be so kind, they just have a couple questions.
Korra: But--

(Tarrlok moves Korra out in front of him, leaving her to fend for herself against the press.)

Journalist: Avatar Korra, you witnessed Amon take away people's bending firsthand. How serious a threat does he pose to the innocent citizens of Republic City?
Korra: (hesitantly) Ahem. I think he presents a real problem. 

(Tarrlok looks away and smiles smugly.)

Journalist: Than why have you refused to join Tarrlok's task force? As the Avatar, shouldn't you be going after Amon?
Korra: (camera flashes in her eyes) Well, I--
Journalist: Why are you backing away from this fight?
Korra: (annoyed) What?! No, I've never backed away from anything in my life. 
Journalists: You promised to serve this city. Are you going back on that promise now? Do you think Pro-Bending is more important than fighting the revolution? How do you think Avatar Aang would've handled this? Are you afraid of Amon?
Korra: (angrily) I'm not afraid of anybody! If the city needs me, than, I'll join Tarrlok's task force and help fight Amon.
Tarrlok: (walks back to Korra and puts his hand on her shoulder) There's your headline, folks.

(The jounralists begin taking more photos. Cut to a close up of Tenzin as he closes his eyes and tilts his head down sadly. Cut to Asami, Bolin, and Mako. Mako and Bolin look to each other worriedly. A camera flash cuts back to Tarrlok smiling smugly with his arm around Korra. Another flash cut to a close up of Korra looking very worried. Cut to black.)



Act III

(Fade in to an establishing shot of city hall at sunset. Cut to a closeup of Korra's hands as she twiddles her thumbs at a table. then tilt up to show Korra looking nervouse and dressed in a task force uniform. Tarrlok begins to speak, and the camera pans around Korra to reveal the rest of the task force members around the table and then stopping on Tarrlok adressing them.)

Tarrlok: My fellow task force deputies. Tonight we will execute a raid on an underground chi-blocking training camp located in the Dragon Flats Burroughs. According to my sources there is a cellar under this bookstore where Equalists train chi-blocking in secret.

(As Tarrlok speaks, he points to a blue print of the bookstore with notes written on it. The camera zooms in on the blueprint and the scene match dissolves to an overhead shot of the bookstore at night. A police truck with a large tank of water on it drives up to the building. Cut to a shot of Korra and other task force members crouching in the bed of the truck as it pulls up. It comes to a stop and they all climb out. Tarrlok, Korra, and the task force approach the wall and look down into the basement window. From Korra's point of view we see Equalists wearing bandanas around their faces practicing chi blocking. Korra looks toward the back wall and sees a large banner of Amon hanging there. Cut to a close up of the Amon banner, then flash cut to a shot of Amon reaching out towards the camer from Korra's nightmare. 

Cut to Korra gasping and pulling bck from the window. She looks frightened but steels herself and looks over to Tarrlok. Tarrlok smiles and nods to Korra before giving the signal to the rest of the task force. One of the members turns a valve on top of the water tank and opens it up. He pulls a large stream of water out with his bending and it is passed down to the benders by the wall, each taking a part of it. Tarrlok holds a hand up to make them wait. Korra takes a deep breath as she gets ready and the background music intensifies.

Cut to the inside of the basement. Everything is silent for a moment before suddenly huge torrents of water burst through the windows above. They knock down four Equalists before freezing them in place. The camera zooms out as the wall is burst open by earthbending, and the other Equalists leap back to avoid the debris. Earthbender task force member leap out from the dust and strike at the Equalists, knocking down two more while others leap to dodge the rocks. An earthbender catches on Equalist by surprise by slamming a large floor tile against her and into the wall. Korra and Tarrlok jump into the fray with water ready. Tarrlok throws water at one Equalist and freezes his head. Another Equalist flips out of the way, and the scene goes into slow motion as he tosses out two smoke grenades pouring out green fumes before running out the door with another Equalist. Korra throws water at the grenades and freezes them to keep them from hiding the Equalists' escape.)

Korra: I'm going after those two!

(Cut to the inside of an old hallway in disrepair as Korra slams the door open and runs past the camera. Cut to a low angle shot of Korra approaching, then focus in on a trip wire which Korra stumbles over. She trips and falls to the floor, and the camera quickly tilts up to the rafters as a chi blocker leaps down. Korra is frightened, but rolls and flips out of the way, missing the chi blocker's strikes. As Korra falls backward, she kicks into the air and earthbends a large rock from the floor up into the chi blocker. Korra lands on her butt, and another chi blocker spinning a bolo lands behind her only to be struck with a torrent of water and frozen to the wall. by Tarrlok.)

Korra: Nice timing. Thanks, Tarrlok.
Tarrlok: We make a good team, Avatar.

(Cut to an overhead shot and tilt up from Tarrlok to Korra, showing the two incapacitated chi blockers.)

Korra: (arms crossed) Yeah, we do. 

(The scene flash cuts to a shot of journalists and photographers taking pictures of the captured Equalists and the task force members, all lined up within the battle torn basement. A photo flash cuts to a closer still shot of Korra and Tarrlok posing behind the tied up chi blockers. Another photo flash cuts to a still shot of Tarrlok, Korra, and the task force leading the Equalists into the back of a police truck. One more photo flash cuts to a shot of the task force and chi blockers surrounded by journalists. Tarrlok is smiling smuggly while Korra is at the front and looking determined. The color becomes desaturated as the shot transitions to a picture in a newspaper which pulls away from the camera. Bolin walks by carrying two earth discs with his earthbending. The camera cuts to a wider shot of the training room at the Pro Bending arena. Mako is sitting down on a spring board with the newspaper and Toza is sweeping the floor.)

Bolin: No Korra for practice again?
Mako: Doesn't look like it. 

(Bolin tosses his discs away and pouts comically, hunching his back. The scene cuts to Tarrlok and Korra at a press conference set indoors adressing a large group of journalists seated in front of them. Tarrlok is at the podium.)

Tarrlok: Avatar Korra has bravely answered the call to action. With the two of us leading the charge, Republic City has nothing to fear from Amon and the Equalists.
Journalist: Question for the Avatar! Amon remains at large. Why have you failed to locate him?
Korra: (approaching the podium) You wanna know why? Because Amon is hiding in the shadows like a coward. (grabs a microphone) Amon, I challenge you to a duel. No task force. No chi blockers. Just the two of us tonight at midnight on Avatar Aang Memorial Island. Let's cut to the chase and settle this thing. If you're man enough to face me. 

(All is quiet save for some feedback from the microphone as Korra sets it back down and goes to exit the room. Then the journalists stand and explode with questions, all trying to get Korra's attention. The scene cuts to Mako and Asami riding in a taxi cab through a park at night. Romantic background music is playing.)

Asami: I know it sounds weird to say this but I'm really glad I hit you with my Moped. 
Mako: (bashful) Uh, aw, me too. 
Asami: I forgot to ask. Why didn't you accept the new silk scarf I bought for you last week? You didn't like it?
Mako: No, it was really nice. But this scarf was my father's and it's all I have left of him. I just feel like, like it keeps me safe. 
Asami: I'm so sorry. I lost my mother when I was very young. (Mako takes Asami's hand in his. They smile at each other for  moment before Asmi rests her head on his shoulder) I feel so safe with you. 

(The taxi rides off down the street by a pond, passing by other couples. The scene cuts to an establishing shot of the city wharf, where fog is covering most of the area. Tenzin flies by the camera on his glider. Cut to a shot of Korra in a boat with a lantern as she unties it from a pier. Tarrlok and members of his task force stand on the pier and Tenzin lands next to them.)

Tenzin: Korra, this is madness!
Korra: Don't try to stop me and don't follow me. I have to face Amon alone. 
Tenzin: (to Tarrlok) This is all your doing!
Tarrlok: I tried to talk her out of it too but she's made up her mind. (Korra uses waterbending to drive her boat over the water to Memorial Island) We'll be watching the island closely. If anything goes wrong I have a fleet of police air ships ready to swoop down. 

(The camera is positioned between Tarrlok and Tenzin, and zooms in on Korra as she approaches the island. The scene dissolves to a shot of Aang's statue, then tilts down to Korra waiting below. Cut to a wide shot of Korra standing on top of the statue's platform. A clock is positioned on top of the archway beneath. Cut to a close up of Korra's profile. A noise is heard and she looks to her left. The camera quickly zooms out as Korra turns and readies herself for a fight. Cut to a wide overhead shot of the roof. The music goes quiet. Cut back to Korra as she relaxes. She is surprised when a loud bell suddenly rings, and the camera zooms out quickly to show the clock beneath her, then to a close up of the clock with its hands pointing to midnight. As the clock's bell rings, we cut to different shots; first a cut to a wide pan shot of Republic City's skyline, then cut to a close up of the twelve symbol on the clock, a tilting up shot of the statue of Aang, then cut back to Korra as she sighs. Korra takes a deep breath, readying herself and flexing her arms. Cut to a shot from behind Korra as she looks out over the bay at Republic City. There is a dissolve to the same shot forward in time. Korra is sitting down and the Republic City is no longer lit up. Cut back in front of Korra as she yawns and stretches.)

Korra: Guess you're a no-show, Amon. Who's scared now? 

(Korra stands up and leaves. Cut to a shot of Korra on ground level near the archway. She begins to pass it by and puts her hands behind her head. Jump cut to a shot from within the darkened hallway, and the camera follows a bolo at the end of a rope as it flies through the air towards Korra's legs. The camera quickly tilts up to Korra's face, then cuts to a shot of her legs as they are tied together, tripping her. Korra has a moment to be surprised before she's dragged off into the dark passage, grunting in discomfort. As she is dragged, Korra manages to stick her legs into the air and break free with firebending. The passage is lit up and the camera reveals about two dozen chi blockers surrounding Korra as she gets to her feet. 

Korra catches her breath, then turns and gasps as the passage goes pitch black, save for the glowing red goggles of the chi blockers. Korra firebends, spinning her fist around behind her and punching with the other, lighting up the passage as she keeps the chi blockers at bay. Her arms are caught by two bolos and she struggles to break free as two chi blockers leap at her. Korra kicks at them and sends another blast of fire, then knocks them away with another kick that earthbends the floor up beneath them. The passage darkens again as two chi blockers come up behind Korra and strike the pressure points in her back, paralyzing her, as everything fades to black.

Fade in to a tilting down shot of Korra lying on the ground, illuminted by a lantern and surrounded by a circle of chi blockers. Korra is lifted up by the arms by two of them. She pants softly as she regains consciousness, then looks up and gasps. Cut to Korra's point of view as Amon steps out from the darkness.)

Amon: I received your invitation, young Avatar. (Korra is scared speechless, and Amon reaches a hand out towards her. Cut to a close up of Korra as Amon's hand comes closer, and she looks away, afraid of what he will do. Cut to a close up of Amon looking down, his hand in the foreground. The music intensifies and we cut to a close shot of Korra as Amon instead grasps her by the chin, forcing her to look up at him) Our showdown, while inevitable, is premature. Although it would be the simplist thing for me to take away your bending right now, I won't. You'd only become a martyr. Benders of every nation would rally behind your untimely demise. But I assure you I have a plan and I'm saving you for last. Then you'll get your duel and I will destroy you. 

(Amon stands up from kneeling down and strikes a pressure point in Korra's shoulder to knock her out. Cut to Korra's point of view as she looks up at Amon, her vision blurring before falling to the floor. Fade to black, then quickly flash cut to a dream sequence in sepia tone. There is a quick series of shots separated by more flash cuts. First Sokka, then Toph with metalbending police, then Aang, then a close up of Yakone's eyes, then Aang riding an air scooter, looking angry and ready for battle. Cut to black, then fade back to Korra's point of view, still on the floor, as Tenzin runs towards her.)

Korra: Aang?
Tenzin: (helping Korra sit up) Korra! Korra, are you alright? What happened? Was Amon here? 
Korra: Ye-yeah. He ambushed me. 
Tenzin: Did he, did he take your bending away?

(Korra creates a small flame in her hand before clasping and extinguishing it.)

Korra: No. I'm okay. 
Tenzin: Oh, thank goodness.

(Korra's eyes quiver before she breaks down and cries, tears streaming down her cheeks. She leans into Tenzin, burying her head into his chest and hugging him close. Tenzin hugs her back gently to help comfort her.)

Korra: I was so terrified! I felt so helpless.
Tenzin: It's alright. The nightmare is over. 
Korra: (sobbing) You were right. I've been scared this whole time. I've never felt like this before and I don't know what to do. 
Tenzin: Admitting your fears is the first, and most difficult, step in overcoming them. 

(The camera tilts upwards, away from Korra and Tenzin and into the darkness.)
