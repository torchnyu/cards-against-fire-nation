(She slides out from under Zuko irritably)

Zuko: I'll take that as a thank you.

(Zuko runs towards the air ships.)

Aang: (Cut back to Aang who looks on, stunned) Zuko, no!

Katara: (Cut to Katara who turns her head back) No, (Cut to a side view of Katara as she walks to Hakoda) the Fire Nation can't separate our family again.

(She earthbends herself onto Appa.)

Suki: (Cut to the inside of the saddle as Toph lands) Umm, there's an awful lot of fire in that general direction. (They cringe as their surroundings continue to crumble and shake)

Zuko: She's not going to make it. 

(Cut to a frustrated Azula as she tugs the hairpiece off her hair and firebends with her feet as the force propels her to the nearby cliff. As she nears the cliff, she backflips and digs her hairpiece into the rocks as she skids down, pushing her legs against the rocks to slow down her descend. She finally stops. Cut back to Zuko.) 

Zuko: Of course she did.

(He looks away and camera zooms out on the group who look back at Azula. Cut back to Azula who looks on with a satisfied smirk. Scene fades to night the top of a rocky hill and camera slowly zooms in on the group seated around a campfire. Appa can be seen sleeping at the side.)

Aang: Wow, camping. It really seems like old times again, doesn't it 
Zuko: (Cut to Zuko who breaks a biscuit in half) If you really want to feel like old times, I could, uhh... chase you around a while and try to capture you. 

(Camera zooms out on the laughing group as Zuko eats his biscuit.)

Katara: (Cut to a close up side view of Katara who looks down sorely) Haha.
Sokka: (Cut to Sokka and he raises his cup) To Zuko. Who knew after all those times he tried to snuff us out, today, he be our hero. (Cut to Sokka's point of view as the rest except Katara raise their cups)
Toph, Aang, Suki & Sokka: Here, here. (Toph and Aang nudge Zuko with their elbows)

Katara: (Cut to Katara who glares at him) Yeah, no kidding. (Cut to an overhead view of the group as she stands up and leaves)
Sokka: (raises an eyebrow) What's with her?
Zuko: (stands up) I wish I knew. (He walks off as the others look at him quizzically)
Sokka: What's with him?

(Cut to a side view of the whole scene. Zuko can be seen following Katara near the edge of a cliff. Cut to the full moon partially covered by some clouds. Cut to the cliff as Katara is seen kneeling and Zuko still walking towards her. Cut to Katara who notices Zuko. She gets up and moves away.)

Zuko: This isn't fair. (puts  both arms out) Everyone else seems to trust me now. What is it with you? (swipes one arm to the side)
Katara: (Cut to Katara's back as she turns around and snaps) Oh, everyone trust you now? (places hand on chest) I was the first person to trust you, remember Back in Ba Sing Se. (points to the ocean) And you turned (Cut to Zuko who looks down guiltily) around and betrayed me. Betrayed all of us. 
Zuko: (raises head) What can I do to make it up to you? 
Katara: You really want to know? (walks towards Zuko) Hmm, maybe you could re-conquer (Cut to Zuko's unscarred side who looks on speechlessly) Ba Sing Se in the name of the Earth King. Or, (Zuko steps back as Katara's head pops into screen) I know. You could bring my mother back. 

(She hits Zuko shoulder with hers as she walks past. Zuko looks back sadly. Cut to an overhead view of the cliff as the waves crash at the bottom of it. Cut to the tents. Cut to Suki who looks around warily. Zuko walks out from the rock between them. They don't see each other until the last minute where they accidentally bump into each other.)

Suki: (raises her arms and blushes) Opps, wrong tent.
Zuko: (Suki walks away) Sorry. Do you need to talk to Sokka too? 
Suki: (still blushing) Nope. (moves  her arms in a "No" gesture) Not me. 

(She moves off screen. Cut to the inside of Sokka's tent as Zuko enters with an exaggerated, animated sweat drop expression on his face. Cut to Sokka who is lying on his stomach on a mat surrounded by candles that exudes a romantic ambience. There's a bunch of roses hung above him.)

Sokka: (turns his head with a rose in his mouth) Well, hellooo. (His eyes widen as a comical sound effect plays and he swallows the rose. Cut to a sideview of the scene as Zuko still has the sweatdrop expression and proceeds to sit in front of Sokka) Uh, Zuko. Yes, (sits up) why would (chews the flower) I be expecting any one different? (He swallows the flower with a pained expression and coughs out some petals) So what's on your mind?
Zuko: Your sister, she hates me and I don't know why! But I do care what she thinks of me.
Sokka: Nah, she doesn't hate you. Katara doesn't hate anyone. (moves his hand across in an arc) Except maybe some people in the Fire Nation. (his  eyes widen as he realizes what he just said) No, I mean, uh, not people who are good but used to be bad. (makes pacifying gestures with his hands) I mean, bad people. Fire Nation people who are so bad, who have never been good (places his arms in a X shape) and probably won't be ever! (opens it to the side)
Zuko: (interrupts) Stop. Okay, listen. I know this may seem out of no where, (Cut to a serious Zuko as the camera slowly zooms in) but I want you to tell me what happened to your Mother.
Sokka: (Cut to a stunned Sokka) What? Why would you want to know that?
Zuko: Katara mentioned it before when we were imprisoned together in Ba Sing Se and again just now when she was yelling at me. I think somehow... she's connected her anger about that to her anger at me.
Sokka: (looks to the side sadly) It's not a day I like to remember. 

(Flashback to the blue sky as camera pans down to the village. Young Sokka raises his head out from a snow fort. A snowball enters the screen and hits his face.

Camera slowly zooms out to show the other villagers starting up as well.)

Katara: I'm going to find Mum. (She runs past her brother. Sokka runs the other direction)
Sokka: (voiceover) Many of the warriors (Cut to 3 Fire Nation ships closing in on the village) have seen the black snow before (Cut to Sokka and a few other adult warriors armed with clubs who run towards the ship) and they knew what it meant. (Cut to a line of Fire Nation soldiers) A Fire Nation raid. 

(The soldiers yell a battle cry. Cut back to the Water Tribe warriors who ready themselves. Cut to the bottom of the ship as the soldiers jump off their ships into the snow and stand up with their palms on fire. Cut to Hakoda and some other warriors who yell a battle cry as well and charge. Cut to the charging Fire Nation soldiers. Cut to Sokka who looks on behind the safety of another snow fort.)

Sokka: (Cut to the soldiers and warriors who begin to fight) We were badly outnumbered. (The warriors throw the soldiers off their feet before they start to firebend) But somehow, we managed to drive them off. (Cut to a soldier being thrown towards the place Sokka is hiding. His head gets stuck in the snow. Sokka throws snow on his back and uses the soldier's back as a stool to reach the ground. Cut to a boomerang on the ground as Sokka picks it up. He runs towards the ship but stops. The other warriors in the background stop as well.) As quickly as they came, (Cut to a back view of Sokka as the soldiers run back to their ships) they just left. (Cut back to Sokka who throws his boomerang. Fade back to present day Sokka.) I was so relieved when it was over but, that's because I didn't know yet what have
happened. (He lowers his head and composes himself) I didn't know we lost our Mother.
Zuko: Wait. Can you remember any details about the soldiers who raided your village Like, what the lead ship looked like?
Sokka: (Cut to Sokka as he thinks) Yeah... (Flashback to 3 red Fire Nation flags with raven symbols on them) Sea Ravens. The main ship had flags with sea ravens on them. (Cut to present day Zuko)
Zuko: The symbol of The Southern Raiders. Thanks, Sokka.
Sokka: No problem. (places an arm around Zuko's shoulder) Thanks for stopping by. (pushes the tent opening aside and shoves Zuko out and sighs) Thought he never leave. (hopeful, optimistic music plays as Sokka smiles and rubs his hands together and pushes the tent opening aside. Cut to the outside of the tent as his head pops out) Suki.

(Camera zooms out to show Zuko still outside his tent. Sokka looks at him and whistles as he retreats back into his tent. Zuko storms off. Scene changes to morning. Cut to Katara coming out of her tent. She looks at something in front of her tent and frowns. Cut to show Zuko sitting on a rock in front of her tent. He looks up sleepily.)

Katara: (Cut to a side view of the scene) You look terrible. (She >ignores him and rummages through her bag)
Zuko: (stands up and rubs his eyes) I waited out here all night. (Katara proceeds to comb her hair)
Katara: What do you want?
Zuko: (Cut to a close up of Katara with Zuko behind her) I know who killed your Mother. (she widens her eyes and stops combing) I'm going to help you find him. 

(Cut to the back of Katara's head as she turns around with a shocked look on her face. The expression changes to seriousness. Camera slowly zooms in on her face. Cut to commercial break.)



Act II

(Scene returns to an overhead view of Appa who seems to be grazing. Cut to Sokka who is fiddling with a necklace of flowers.)

Katara: I need to borrow Appa. 

(Zuko follows behind her with his bag.)

Aang: (feeding Appa hay) Why? Is it your turn to take a little fieldtrip with Zuko?
Katara: Yes, it is.
Aang: (Cut to Aang who is surprised) Oh. What's going on?
Katara: We're going to find the man who took my Mother from me. 

(Cut to a surprised Sokka as he lays the necklace aside and stands up.)

Zuko: (off screen) Sokka told me the story of what happened. I know who did it. And I know how to find him. 
Aang: Umm... and what exactly do you think this would accomplish? 
Katara: (sighs and shakes her head) I knew you wouldn't understand. (She begins to walk away)
Aang: (Cut to a close up of Katara as Aang and Sokka look on behind her) Wait, stop, I do understand. You're feeling unbelievable pain and rage. How do you think I felt about the sandbenders when they stole Appa? How do you think I felt about the Fire Nation when I found out what happened to my people?
Zuko: (off screen) She needs this, (everyone turn their eyes towards him) Aang. This is about getting closure and justice. 
Aang: I don't think so. I think it's about getting revenge. 
Katara: (off screen) Fine! (Cut to an angry and frustrated Katara) Maybe it is. Maybe that's what I need. Maybe that's what he deserves. 
Aang: Katara, you sound like Jet. 
Katara: (defensively) It's not the same. Jet attacked the innocent. This man, he's a monster. 
Sokka: Katara, she was my Mother too. But I think Aang might be right. 
Katara: Then you didn't love her the way I did.
Sokka: (speechless) Katara...
Aang: The monks used to say that revenge is like a two-headed ratviper. While you watch your enemy go down, you're being poisoned yourself. 
Zuko: That's cute. But this isn't air temple pre-school. It's the real World. 
Katara: (Camera zooms out to place Katara on screen) Now that I know he's out there, now that I know we could find him, I feel like I have no choice.
Aang: Katara, you do have a choice. Forgiveness. 
Zuko: That's the same as doing nothing. 
Aang: (shakes head) No it's not. It's easy to do nothing. (Camera slowly zooms in) But it's hard to forgive. 
Katara: (Cut to Katara who looks on darkly) It's not just hard, it's impossible. 

(She turns and walks away. Cut to an overhead shot of the scene as Zuko follows after her. Cut to nighttime and camera pans down from the Moon to the campsite. Cut to Katara in a black ninja-like outfit tying her hair. Aang & Sokka can be seen peering out from a rock behind her.)

Aang: (Aang & Sokka climb over the rock) So you were just going to take Appa anyway?
Katara: Yes.
Aang: It's okay, because I forgive you. (smiles< hopefully) That give you any ideas?
Katara: (Cut to a side view of the scene. Zuko is also wearing the same outfit as Katara and is packing his bag.) Don't try to stop us. 
Aang: I wasn't planning to. This is a journey you need to take. You need to face this man. (Katara nods and she climbs on Appa's horn to his head) But when you do, please don't choose revenge. (Zuko throws his bag into the saddle) Let your anger out and then let it go. Forgive him. 
Zuko: (Cut to Zuko who appears to be tired of his preaching) Okay, we'll be sure to do that guru-goody-goody. (He climbs aboard Appa)
Katara: (Cut to Katara looking down at Aang from Appa's head) Thanks for understanding Aang. Yip yip. (Appa takes off. Cut back to an area behind the guys as they look up at the departing bison)
Sokka: You know, you're pretty wise for a kid. 
Aang: Thanks, Sokka.
Sokka: Usually it's annoying but right now, I'm just impressed. 
Aang: (narrows his eyes) I appreciate that. 
Sokka: So... can I borrow Momo for a week?
Aang: (turns his head towards Sokka rapidly) Why do you need Momo? 

(Sokka shrugs and makes an "I don't know" noise. Cut to Katara on Appa. Cut to a side view of Appa flying past the Moon.)

Zuko: (off screen) We need to find the Fire Navy communication tower. (Cut to Zuko leaning on the saddle) All the navy's movements are coordinated by messenger hawk. And every tower has to be up to date on where everyone is deployed. 
Katara: (off screen) So once (Cut to a communication tower in the middle of the ocean as the building slowly becomes bigger as they near it) we find the communication tower, we bust in and take the information we need.
Zuko: (off screen) Not exactly. (Appa flies into screen just above the water and it airbends with its tail to propel it forward. It displaces some water below.) We need to be stealthy (Cut to the communication tower as camera pans down to show the whole building structure and a bunch of rocks below) and make sure no one spots us. Otherwise, (Appa flies into screen and lands) they'll warn The Southern Raiders. Long before we reach them. 

(Cut to the rocks as Katara and Zuko run out from behind them. She waterbends the water into a raft of ice and both of them jump on it. She proceeds to surf the raft. Cut to a side view of the scene as she creates a tall wave to bring the raft up to the tower and they jump off. Cut to a corridor of the tower as a door opens and 2 guards walk out.

Katara: (Cut to Katara who furrows her brows in seriousness) Whale Tail Island, here we come. 

(Fade to an overhead shot of Appa flying at day time. Cut to a sleeping Zuko in the saddle as he wakes up and looks up at Katara.)

Zuko: (Cut to a front shot of Katara with black circles under her eyes and holding Appa's reins tightly) You should get some rest. We'll be there in a few hours. You'll need all your strength. 
Katara: Now, don't you worry about my strength. I have plenty. (Cut to a side view of Katara) I'm not the helpless little girl I was when they came. 

(Camera pans to the right and fades back to the Water Tribe siblings looking up at the black snow.)

Katara: I'm going to find Mum.

(She runs past her brother just like in Sokka's flashback. Cut to an overhead view of the scene as several people run deeper into the village. Cut to Katara who runs back in as warriors run past her. Cut to the inside of a hut as the curtain is pushed aside by Katara.)

(Cut to an area behind Katara's shoulder as Katara's mother is almost on her knees on the ground in front of a Fire Nation soldier. The soldier turns back and looks at Katara. Camera zooms in on Katara's face as her eyes almost tear up.)

Katara's Mum: (off screen) Just let her go and (Cut to Katara's Mum who pleads) I'll give you the information you want.
Fire Nation soldier: (Camera pans up to the soldier) You heard
your Mother, get out of here! 
Katara: (Cut to an area behind her Mother's shoulder as Katara looks on, frightened) Mum, I'm scared.
Katara's Mum: (assuringly) Go find your Dad, sweetie. I'll handle this. 

(Cut to a reluctant Katara who looks at the soldier. Cut to the soldier who stares down at her fiercely. Camera zooms in on the soldier's dark brown eye. Cut back to Katara who pushes the curtains aside and runs out of the house.)

Katara: (Cut to a desperate Katara running in the snow) I ran as fast as I could. 

(She stops at the edge of a small hill and looks down.)

Katara: (shouts) Dad! Dad! (Camera pans down to show Hakoda throwing a firebending soldier hard into the snow.) Please, I think Mum's in trouble! There's a man in our house. 

(Hakoda lets go of the soldier immediately)

Hakoda: Kya! 

(He runs off. Cut to Katara and Hakoda's backs as the run back to their home. Camera zooms in on the curtain as Hakoda's gloved hand pushes the curtain aside. Camera fades to white and returns back to present day Katara.)

Katara: But, we were too late. When we got there, the man was gone. (voice cracks slightly) And so was she. 
Zuko: (Cut to a sorrowful Zuko) Your Mother was a brave woman.
Katara: (Cut to a front shot of Katara as she touches her necklace) I know.

(Cut to a side view of Appa flying. Cut to an overhead shot of Appa flying at night. Zuko has taken over the reins and Katara is sleeping in the saddle. Cut to Zuko looking through a telescope.)

Yon Rha: (Cut to an area behind his Mother's hand looking at Yon Rha's back as he turns to face his Mum) Would you like something else from the garden? I would be happy to...

Yon Rha: (Cut to Kya's point of view as she looks up at Yon Rha) You're lying. My source says there's one waterbender left in The Southern Water Tribe. (Yon Rha walks closer) We're not leaving until we find the waterbender. 
Kya: (Cut to Kya) If I tell you, do you promise (she lowers her head and closes her eyes to make a decision) to leave the rest of the village alone? (Cut to a side view of Yon Rha as he nods his head and makes a
"Hmm" sound.) It's me. (Cut to Kya who looks up) Take me as your prisoner.

Yon Rha: (Cut to a side view of Yon Rha as he kneels) I did a bad thing. I know I did and you deserve revenge. So why don't you take my Mother? That would be fair.
Katara: (Cut to Katara who looks on, pityingly) I always wonder what kind of person could do such a thing. But now that I see you, I think I understand. (She walks forward) There's just nothing inside you. Nothing at all. You're pathetic and sad and empty. 
Yon Rha: (Cut to Yon Rha as he pleads) Please spare me.

Aang: (Cut to a frontal shot of Katara with the boys behind her as the camera pans up) Zuko told me what you did. (He rubs his head) Or... what you didn't do, I guess. I'm proud of you.
Katara: I wanted to do it. I wanted to take out all my anger at him but, I couldn't. (closes her eyes sadly) I don't know if it's because I'm too weak to do it or if it's because I'm strong enough not to. 
Aang: (off screen) You did the right thing. (Cut to a side view of the port) Forgiveness is the first step you have to take to begin healing. (Katara stands up and walks towards Aang)
Katara: (Cut to a frontal shot of a serious and still angry Katara) But I didn't forgive him. I'll never forgive him. (Her face softens as she looks up at Zuko) But I am (Camera pans to show Zuko's back as Aang turns his head towards his teacher) ready to forgive you.

(Cut to Aang who is stunned at the question and looks to the side, unsure and confused. Fade to white.)
