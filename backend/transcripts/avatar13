Sokka: You did it! You should have seen yourself, it was amazing! (He lifts his arms from both girls shoulders and stands on one leg, lifting his bandaged leg off the ground) You were all like, (he proceeds to make several punching gestures) "pshoom, pfoom, pfoom, phish, whoom", and then the Fire Lord was all like, (he pretends to choke himself) "eugh, eh, eh, eh, eugh, aye".

(Cut to Aang's side view as Suki carefully inspects Ozai who is slumped against a rock.)

Aang: (matter-of-factly) A giant Lion Turtle.
Toph:(She crosses her arms and Sokka walks off screen) You have the craziest adventures when you disappear.

(Cut to an area behind Aang's leg looking at Sokka limping his way to Ozai)

Sokka: (mocking) Well, look at you buster. Now that your firebending is gone, I guess we should call you the "Loser Lord". 
Ozai: (pulls himself up with the help from the rock behind him) I am the Phoenix King!

(He points his finger out warningly towards Sokka but he drops back to the floor. It is noted his eyes are slightly dilated.)

Suki: (Cut to a close up of a drooling Ozai with Suki, Sokka and Toph still visible in the background) Yeah, or how about "King of the Guys Who... Don't Win" 
Toph: (Ozai simply blinks, closes and opens his mouth. It seems he has temporarily lost control of his body) Leave the nicknames to us (points to herself) honey.

Zuko: So does this mean you don't hate me anymore? 
Mai: (she blushes) I think it means... (Cut to a close up of the couple) I actually (places a hand on Zuko's cheek) kind of like you. (They lean in for a kiss and part a fewseconds later, looking into each other's eyes happily) But don't ever (She jabs a finger into Zuko's shoulder and Zuko's eye traces the movement of her finger) break up (She lifts her finger into the air and Zuko's eyes still follows it) with me again.
