["Previously on The Legend of Korra" sequence, using clips from "The Spirit of Competition" and "The Aftermath".]

Radio Broadcaster: (voice over) Republic City is at war! After discovering that her father, Hiroshi Sato, is working with the enemy, Asami turns against him. And following another defeat at the hands of the Equalists, Lin Beifong resigns as Chief of Police. With the Equalist army growing stronger, who will help the Avatar stop Amon and restore balance to the city?



Act I

(Episode opens up to the sea looking towards Air Temple Island. A ship that looks like a Chinese junk boat sails into view. Camera angle changes Bolin with Pabu on his shoulder standing near the edge of the boat looking excited at Air Temple Island. Pabu whistles and chirps. Behind him, Mako and Asami are cuddled up next to each other and they are also look equally excited about heading towards the island. Behind the couple, there is an Air Acolyte controlling the sails. The camera pans out to a beautiful view of the entire island as the boat pulls into the dock. Cut to the docks as Korra and the airbender kids wave to the boat.)

Ikki: You're finally here! (Two Air Acolytes lower a ramp from the boat to the dock.) Welcome to Air Temple Island! (Bolin has a bag slung over his shoulder and he proceeds to disembark. Cut to an excited Ikki) Your new home! (Camera pans to the right to Meelo)
Meelo: Yes, welcome to my domain! (Camera angle changes to the trio leaving the ship)
Bolin: Well aren't you sweet, (bends forward slightly) little monk child?

(Pabu scurries down Bolin's shoulder towards the ground and chirps as it walks between Meelo's legs. The boy bends down curiously.)

Meelo: What's that fuzzy creature? 

(Meelo stands up and points off screen as the camera follows his movement. All the teens turn towards Pabu with a smile on their faces. We then see Pabu walking up to Naga and sniffing each other.)

Jinora: (off screen) That is a Fire Ferret. (Pabu stands up and uses its paw to touch Naga's snout. Cut to Jinora reciting the facts with a finger up in the air.) An arboreal mammal common (turns towards her brother) to the bamboo forests of the central Earth Kingdom.
Ikki: (Ikki pops up from behind Jinora and gasps) He's cuuute! 

(Ikki squees and runs off screen towards Pabu. Meelo airbends upwards while Jinora puts a finger into her ears to silence Ikki's shrieks. Cut to Pabu who hisses at Ikki and runs under Naga. The girl follows suit as she continues giggling with joy. Meelo descends down on Naga's head  and grabs the polar bear dog's ears, pulling it backwards.)

Meelo: Yip yip! Fly, sky bison, fly! 

(Naga does not react to Meelo's antics and Ikki continues to chase Pabu around the dock. Cut to Korra looking at the children and Mako steps forward towards her.)

Mako: Thanks for sending the air acolytes to help us with the move.
Asami: Yes, they've been amazing! (places a hand up with praise) Such tireless workers.

(Cut to a side view of the boat as we see two Air Acolytes carrying several trunks of luggage. We can hear them grunting as they walk down the ramp.)

Korra: Oh, I thought you were only bringing a few (Korra shrieks on that word as the luggage threaten to topple onto her but the Air Acolytes manage to balance themselves in time.) things? 
Mako: Trust me, (the Air Acolytes re-orientate themselves and they walk towards the island) it could have been worse.
Korra: No problem. Everyone here wants you guys to feel welcome.

(Cut to the gates of Air Temple Island as Naga chases after Pabu while the rest of the teens and children stroll behind them. Ikki runs around with her hands outstretched as she hums gleefully. Cut to a side view shot of Asami, Mako and Jinora. Asami turns towards her right and her expression changes to curiosity. Camera cuts to reveal Meelo staring rather adoringly at her with a smile on his face.)

Meelo: You're pretty, (reaches a hand upwards) can I have some of your hair?
Mako: (Camera returns back to the walking trio) Looks like (Asami turns her head back towards Mako) I have some competition.

(Camera pans out to the whole group and Ikki turns back to address the newcomers.)

Ikki: And now for the grand tour! (Cut to Ikki's back view as she points to the left and the teens turn their heads towards that direction) The flying bison sleep in those caves down there, (Ikki turns towards the camera and points upwards as the teens look up) and that's the temple Grandpa Aang built, (the girl points to the right and again, the teens look toward the direction she's pointing) and that's the greenhouse where we grow the vegetables we eat! 

(The teens turn their heads back towards Ikki and we cut to a close up of Ikki with a wide smile on her face.)

Bolin: (off screen) I have a couple questions. (Ikki drops her smile and turns her attention towards the earthbender. Cut to Bolin who begins to ask his questions rapidly/) Is this an all vegetarian island? (points off screen) Is that where you train airbending? (grabs his shirt) Do we have to wear Air Acolyte clothes? (looks gleefully at Ikki) Do we each get our own sky bison? (points a finger up in the air) And  final question, how many trees  are on this island? (Cut to a side view of Ikki with a finger on chin, deep in thought and she begins to answer back quickly.)
Ikki: Yes, yes, no, no, ten thousand five hundred and fifty-two.

(Cut to a frontal shot of the teens as they blink at her, all dumbfounded.)

Mako: (awkwardly) So where are we going to be staying? (Camera pans to the left to reveal Meelo standing beside Asami)
Meelo: You're a boy, boys have to stay on the boys' side. (Meelo points off screen)
Jinora: I'd (Mako turns towards Jinora) be happy to show you to the men's dormitory. (Jinora proceeds to walk off screen as Mako follows. Camera cuts to a side view of Korra and the rest of the teens.)
Bolin: I'm a boy! (he proceeds to follow Jinora)
Korra: (turns towards Meelo) Meelo, why don't you go with the boys too?
Meelo: (turns towards Asami and walks backward as he raises a hand in farewell) We shall meet again soon, beautiful woman. (Meelo smiles and runs off screen. Korra turns towards the camera and walks off.)
Korra: Ikki and I will take you to your room this way.

(Asami follows Korra and we cut to what appears to be the women's dormitory. Camera cuts again to a corridor inside the dormitory to show the three girls walking down. Cut to a close up of the trio.)

Ikki: Asami, (the older girl turns towards Ikki) did you know Korra likes Mako?

(Korra stops in her tracks as her eyes grow wide open in horror. We cut to the inside of her head as her face contorts comically and she screams with terror. Fire and lightning effects are shown in the background to emphasize Korra's shock. Fade back to real life as Korra looks all awkward and scared behind Asami.)

Asami: Oh, uh, no, I wasn't completely aware of that.

(Korra grabs Asami's elbow and pulls her off screen. We cut to a set of doors and Korra slides them open to reveal Asami's room. She turns around and smiles at Asami as she gestures into the room. Asami walks into the room and looks around. Korra enters the room and slams the door shut before Ikki can enter.)

Ikki: Hey!
Korra: (off screen) Run along, Ikki! 

(Ikki sighs as her eyes glow white comically and she roars like a tiger as she claws her hand around like a cat. Her eyes stop glowing as she folds her arms and pouts angrily. Cut to the inside of the room with Korra leaning against the door while Asami looks lost in though.)

Korra: (sighs and rubs the back of her head) So... (walks towards Asami) here's your room! (Camera pans across the slightly bare room) I know this is a little rustic compared to what you're used to...
Asami: (Cut to a frontal shot of the teens) I think it's really charming. (walks towards the window) And the best part about it? Nothing here reminds me of my father. Thank you for your hospitality.

(Her sentence gets interrupted by a few urgent knocks on the door.)

Korra: Ikki, I swear, (Korra looks at the door angrily while Asami stares at her, shocked.) if you don't leave us alone I'm gonna- (Cut to the doors as they slide open to reveal Tenzin. Cut back to Korra who has a comical expression of shock and attempts to calm down) Uh, Tenzin! Come right in! (Cut to a side view shot of the scene as Tenzin walks into the room)
Tenzin: Good day, ladies. Asami, welcome to the island. 
Asami: (bows towards Tenzin) Thank you for having me.
 Tenzin: (Tenzin returns the bow and turns towards Korra) Bei Fong's replacement Saikhan is going to be inducted as the new Chief of Police later. I think we should both be there.

(Scene changes to the outside of city hall where a crowd gathers to hear Saikhan's speech.)

Saikhan: (voice over) It was an honour, serving under chief Bei Fong for so many years, (Cut to a close up of Saikhan at the podium with Tarrlok and another council member standing behind him) and I wish her a speedy recovery. It is with great humility that I take her place as the new chief of police. (Camera pans out to show a full frontal view of the podium. The entire council, Korra and a few cops are standing behind him) Republic City is facing a threat like none the world has ever seen, but there is one man who has been effective against Amon's revolution. (Cut to Tarrlok) Councilman Tarrlok! (Tarrlok gives a polite bow while some reporters take a couple of pictures.) That is why, (Tarrlok smiles at Saikhan) for all matters involving the Equalists, (Cut to Tenzin and an angry looking Korra) I will report directly to him. (Korra and Tenzin are shocked by the revelation and turn their heads towards Saikhan) The police department (Tenzin turns his head back to Korra to reassure her and Korra turns her head back to the crowd) will lend any and all available resources (Camera returns back to Saikhan) to the councilman and his task force, until we (slams a fist into the podium) quell this insurgency! 
Korra: (Cut to Tenzin and Korra as she whispers) What is that weasel-snake Tarrlok up to now?

(Both of them glare at Tarrlok while the camera angle changes to the councilman. Ominous music plays in the background. Camera fades to reveal the crowd in front of the police station has dissipated. Cut to Tarrlok shaking the Fire Nation councilwoman's hand as she walks away with the rest of the council members while Tarrlok bows, smiling. Tenzin walks into screen.)

Tenzin: Tarrlok, (Tarrlok turns his head towards Tenzin) I don't know what you did to get Chief Saikhan in your pocket, but I highly doubt it was legal. (Tarrlok still has a smile on his face)
Tarrlok: Oh, Tenzin. Always the conspiracy theorist. Did you ever consider Saikhan simply recognizes my talents (places a hand on his chest) and wants what is best for this city? (Cut to Tenzin as he makes a 'hmph' sound. Korra steps forward to stand beside Tenzin. She is still glaring at Tarrlok) Well, Avatar Korra, long time no see. Now that your little Pro-Bending distractions are over, I look forward (raises a hand out) to your return to my (places a hand on his chest)task force.
Korra: (Cut back to Korra with her arms crossed) Huh, forget it! There's no way I'm rejoining your vanity project.
Tarrlok: (Cut back to a slightly disappointed Tarrlok) That is unfortunate to hear. But I'm sure you'll come to your senses as you have in the past.
Korra: (Camera returns back to a defiant Korra)Don't hold your breath, bub. Y'know, (points a finger at Tarrlok) Tenzin's been right about you all along. You played me, (points to herself) you played Bei Fong, (points off screen)and now you're playing (points at Tarrlok)  the new Chief of Police too. (swipes her hand to the side dismissively as she steps towards Tarrlok.) Well I've got news for you, (Cut to a side view shot of the scene as Korra confronts Tarrlok and points a finger in front of his face. Tarrlok looks amused.) you need me, but I (stands up straight) don't need you. I'm the Avatar.
Tarrlok: (calmly) You're not, in fact, (Korra looks slightly surprised) the Avatar. (Cut to a front shot of Tarrlok as he looks down on her) You are merely a half-baked Avatar in training. Which reminds me, how is your (points towards Korra) airbending going? (Cut to a close up side view shot of Korra as her eyes quiver and she looks sad) Made any significant progress with that? (Korra look down angrily) I... (Cut back to Tarrlok as he shakes his head) didn't think so. If you will not be part of my task force, (walk away) then you had best stay out of my way.

(Tenzin steps forward and lays a hand on Korra's shoulder reassuringly. Korra looks up angrily. Scene changes to an overhead shot of Tenzin and Korra riding on Oogi as it flies through Republic City.)

Korra: I don't understand what's wrong with me! (Cut to a close up of Korra) I've memorized nearly all the practice forms but I still can't produce a single measly puff of air!(gestures her arm around in frustration) I'm a failure.
Tenzin: (Cut to a front view of Tenzin) No you're not. (Korra turns her head towards her mentor) You just need to work through this airbending block.
Korra: Amazing advice, I'll get right on that!
Tenzin: I wasn't finished yet. You see, Aang not only had his bending teachers but (Camera angle changes to a close up shot of Tenzin) also his past lives to call upon for guidance. (turns back towards Korra) Have you ever made contact with your past lives?
Korra: (Camera returns back to a front view of Tenzin) No, of course I haven't! Didn't you get the memo from the White Lotus? I'm a spiritual failure too.
Tenzin: (turns his head back to the front) You may have made a connection without realizing it. (Cut to a frontal shot of a mopey Korra) Perhaps, something you mistook as a dream?
Korra: (blinks and replies uncertainly) Maybe... I had a few weird hallucinations... (Cut to Tenzin's back view) but I hardly even remember them.
Tenzin: (He turns towards the camera) And did you see any of the previous avatars in these visions?
Korra: (Camera returns back to Korra) I saw Aang... it seemed like he was in trouble. What do you think it means?
Tenzin: (Cut to a side view shot of Tenzin) Hm. I don't know. (strokes his beard as he thinks) But I urge you to meditate on these visions. (Scene changes to a far shot of Oogi flying over the sea towards Air Temple Island) I believe Aang's spirit must be trying to tell you something.

(Fade to evening as the camera points towards Avatar Aang's statue. Camera slowly pans back to reveal Korra staring at his statue. The angle changes to show Korra sitting on a cliff. Cut to a close up of Korra as we see tears streaming down her face. She cries and grabs her head, upset.)

Mako: (off screen) Korra? (Korra turns her head towards the voice) You out here? 

(She proceeds to wipe the tears from her face. Cut to a bush as Pabu's head peeks out and it chirps. )

Bolin: (hollers off screen as Pabu climbs onto Korra's shoulder) Kooorrraaa! (Pabu stops in front of Korra and lick the tears off her eyes. Camera pans out to show Bolin, Mako and Asami walking towards her and Pabu jumps off.) There you are. (Bolin reaches down so Pabu can climb onto him) Are you okay?
Korra: (shrugs) I'm fine.
Mako: Come on, what's wrong? You can tell us.
Korra: (Cut to a close up of Korra as she sighs) How am I (looks towards the group) supposed to save the city when I can't even learn airbending? I'm the worst avatar ever! I just feel...alone.
Asami: (Cut to a close up of Asami and Mako) No that's nonsense, you are amazing! 
Mako: Yeah, and remember, Aang hadn't mastered all of the elements when he was battling the Fire Nation. He was just a little kid!
Bolin: And he wasn't alone! (Camera pans to left to show Bolin) He had his friends to help him. Look, (points a finger up) the arena might be shut down, but we're still a team, (raises his hand out hopefully) the new Team Avatar! (Cut to an overhead shot of the cliff)
Mako: We got your back Korra, (everyone places their hands on top of each other) and we can save the city, together! (Korra stands up and places her hand down)
Korra: Yeah, let's do it!
Meelo: (Meelo suddenly descends on their hands, farting loudly as they look on in horror) Yeah, let's do it! (raises a hand up in the air) What are we doing? 

(Meelo lowers his hand as the team laughs heartily. Scene changes to a night view of Republic City as the camera slowly pans out to reveal Bolin looking at the city.)

Bolin: Get ready, Republic City. (Cut to a frontal shot of Bolin as the rest assemble) You (points to the city) are about to be patrolled by Team Avatar. (Bolin pats his bicep as Asami walks into screen with an Equalist glove in her hand.)
Mako: Asami, you always know how to accessorize your outfits.
Asami: (Cut to Asami's hand as the camera pans upwards) I figure one way to fight Equalists is to use an Equalist weapon. (The glove sparks in her hand.)
Korra: (Cut to an enthusiastic Korra) All right. (punches a fist into her palm) Let's ride. 
Bolin: Naga away! 

(Camera pans out to reveal Mako, Asami and Korra already seated on Naga. As Bolin jumps onto Naga, the polar bear dog roars and bends forward, making all of them slide to the ground. The animal shakes its head playfully.)

Korra: (Cut to an embarrassed Korra as she stands up) All right, scratch that. Any other ideas?
Asami: (Cut to Asami as she stands up and flips her hair) Hm, (rests a hand on her chin in thought) I think I have the answer. 

(Cut to the wheels of a Satomobile in the dark as the garage door opens to reveal Mako, Bolin and Korra on the other side. Cut to the front lights of the car as it turns on while Bolin raises his hand to shield his eyes from the bright light. Cut back to the inside of the garage as the car revs its engines and proceeds to drive out of the garage, tires screeching and black smoke billowing from the exhaust. Cut to a frontal shot of the car as it speeds out. Cut to the car drifting to a stop in front of Korra, Bolin and Mako.)

Asami: (Cut to Asami with racing goggles on her forehead) You think this'll do?

(Cut back to the trio as they stare at the car with a smile on their faces and jump into the car. Korra and Bolin sit in the back seat while Mako sits in the passenger seat beside Asami.)

Mako: I like the new Team Avatar style.

(Asami proceeds to change gears and the car speeds off. Scene changes to the heart of Republic City as Team Avatar's car sails down the street. Camera pans to Asami, a top view of the car and back to Korra.)

Police Radio: (voice over) Unit 216, cancelled at 1058 at Army Tower. (Cut to the end of the street as the car continues to drive) Come back to the station. Over.
Asami: (Cut back to the inside of the car) My dad had police scanners installed in all of his cars. I guess now I know why.
Police Radio: (radio cracks to life) Calling all units, (everyone turns their attention to the radio) Level 4 alert! Jailbreak at headquarters, (Cut to the radio panel of the car) officers down, electrocuted! (Cut back to the group, still listening in) Chi-blockers and Equalist convicts are still at large, armed and dangerous, last seen heading east! 
Bolin: Whoa. (Everyone look at each other)
Police Radio: I repeat, Level 4 alert! Equalist jailbreak!

(Camera pans to a street as a couple of motorcycles and a van speed by an intersection while the surrounding cars brake suddenly to prevent impact. Cut to the front of Team Avatar's car.)

Bolin: Chi-blockers! (Camera zooms in on the team.)
Mako: That's them! 
Korra: Let's get 'em!

(Cut to Asami changing gears and camera zooms out to an overhead view of the street as the car turns left to pursue. We cut to the front of another street as a couple of Equalists on motorcycles drive pass while Team Avatar's car is in pursuit. The car drives over the camera and we fade to black for commercial break.)



Act II

(Episode returns to a couple of cars swerving out of the way of the Equalist entourage as they drive down on the wrong side of the street. Cut to an overhead view of Team Avatar's car as it swerves to avoid the stalled cars. Asami narrowly scrapes against the second car but keeps on pursuing. The Equalists drive by as a huge truck comes to a stop.)

Asami: Korra, Bolin! Give me a ramp! (Cut to the back of the car as both Bolin and Korra stand up) Now! 

(Both of them swing their arms as they earthbend ramps. Camera zooms out as the car clears the ramp and flies over the truck. Everyone in the car lets out a 'whoa!' as they land safely and continue the chase. Cut to Bolin with his hair all messed up in front of his face and he pulls it back. Camera angle rapidly switches to Mako as he stands up and generates lightning. Cut to the back of an Equalist motorcycle as one of its tires gets blown out by the lightning and falls to the ground. We return back to Bolin who has bent tiny earth rocks from the ground and he hurls them towards the Equalists at a rapid fire rate. Cut to another Equalist motorist as he dodges a couple of the rocks but one manages to take out his back tyre. The motorcycle spins out of control and he falls to the ground. Asami swerves the car to avoid the fallen Equalist. 

Camera pans down to a third Equalist who looks back at the commotion. He thumbs a switch on his dashboard with a click and we cut to the exhaust pipes of two motorcycles as black smoke billows out. They maneuver their vehicles just in front of Team Avatar's car so the smoke is blown onto them. We cut to the inside of the car and we hear some coughing. Asami pulls down her goggles and drives on with determination.)

Asami: Help me out, we've gotta make this turn! (Korra stands up with a hand in front of her face. Cut to the end of an intersection as a rounded ramp is bent from the ground. The car drives over the ramp, making the turn successfully as they still pursue under the smoke cover. Cut back to Asami.) They don't know we made the turn. Okay, get ready...

(Asami leans her body forward and the camera angle switches to the gear stick as Asami changes gears to speed up. Cut to the front of the two Equalist motorcyclists as the car comes out from the smoke cover and collides with the vehicles. The two chi blockers jump into the air and somersault onto the car, unhurt. Mako stands up and firebends at one of the Equalists but he throws a bola around one hand and restrains Mako. The second Equalist jumps into the backseat and rapidly chi blocks Bolin's arm as he groans in pain. Cut to a frontal shot of Bolin as he slumps back on the seat in agony. Cut to Asami who proceeds to electrocute the Equalist. He moans in pain and falls into the backseat, unconscious.

Cut to a side view shot of the front of the car as both of Mako's wrists are tied up by bolas. The Equalist pulls him forward while Korra yanks Mako backwards, causing the Equalist to fall into the passenger seat. Asami electrocutes him as well. Cut to the back of the car as Mako shoves the unconscious chi blocker off the car. He gets into a stance. Camera angle changes to the front of the Equalist van and Asami pulls her car beside the van while Mako shoots lightning towards the van's driver. The van immediately loses control and it flips on the road, skidding across the surface and knocking over a lamp post before coming to a stop. Cut to an overhead view of the chaos as Asami pulls the car up alongside the truck and Team Avatar disembarks.

Scene changes to the flash of a camera taking a few pictures. Camera pans out to show the reporters taking photographs of a line of Equalists tied up and seated on the road with Team Avatar standing guard behind them. A police siren is heard and a couple of police vehicles pull into the road. Tarrlok leaves one of the vehicles and we cut to Korra looking smug. Cut to Tarrlok looking rather angry as he walk towards Korra with the cops behind him.)

Tarrlok: Avatar Korra, what do you think you're doing?
Korra: (Cut to a smirking Korra as a cop behind her picks up the capture Equalist) Oh, hey, Tarrlok! Nice of you to show up, finally. (gestures a hand out) Here, we captured the escaped convicts for you.
Tarrlok: (frowns) What you did was tear up the city and impede the real authorities in their pursuit of these criminals.
Korra: (raises an eyebrow and patronizes Tarrlok) Hm, that's funny, I didn't see your little task force or the cops the whole time! If it wasn't for Team Avatar, they would have gotten away.
Tarrlok: (Cut back to Tarrlok as he points a finger at Korra while a cop behind him brings the suspect into the police vehicle) This is your last warning! Stay out of my way. 

(Tarrlok swipes his hand aside angrily and turns on his heel to head back to the police transporter. Cut to a smug Korra as the camera pans to the side to show the team joining her with the same smug expression on their faces.

Scene changes to the next day in front of the city hall as the citizens walk about.)

Tarrlok: (voice over) Republic City stands as a beacon of freedom. But the Equalists are using that freedom to tear it down. (Cut to Tarrlok addressing the rest of the council members inside city hall.) The law I have proposed would make it illegal for anyone to be a member of the Equalists, or even be associated with them. It also puts into effect a curfew, ensuring all nonbenders are in their own homes by nightfall.
Tenzin: (Cut to a furious Tenzin) This is going too far, Tarrlok! (stands up) You can't punish all nonbenders for the actions of a few! (swipes hand aside angrily)
Tarrlok: That kind of cowardice will cause our city to fall into Amon's hands. We must pass this law. All in favour?

(Cut to the Fire Nation councilwoman looking at the Earth Kingdom councilman. She raises her hand and he follows suit. The camera pans to the right to reveal the Southern Water Tribe councilman with his hands raised as well. The majority wins and Tenzin sighs and gestures dejectedly. Cut to a scheming Tarrlok.

Scene changes to night fall on a street in Republic City. The camera zooms in on the team resting against the car. Camera angle changes to a closer up of the car to reveal the team eating some flour buns.)

Police Radio: (radio cracks to life) All available units, please respond (the whole team turns their head towards the radio) to the 5600 block of Dragon Flats borough! Equalists have taken to the streets; (Cut to the inside of the car looking at the team) consider them armed and dangerous! Proceed with caution! (Everyone proceeds into the vehicle)
Bolin: (jumping over the windshield into the passenger seat) I call front! 

(Cut to the side view of the car as Mako gestures his hand out.)

Mako: After you.
Korra: What a gentleman, (Mako takes her hand and boosts her up into the backseat) thanks!

(Mako jumps in after her. Cut to Asami looking into the rear view mirror as she sees Mako and Korra talking in the back seat. She furrows her eyes and the camera cuts to the gear stick as Asami starts the car and pulls out onto the streets. Scene changes to an overhead shot of the car driving down the street. Cut to the top of a slope as the car drives over it and the camera pans down to the entire block suffering from a black out. A few police zeppelins are scanning the block with search lights.)

Korra: (voice over) Why is the power out? 

(Cut to one of the darkened streets in the district as the car pulls in and stops. Everyone gets out of the car and Asami pulls her goggles up. We can hear a crowd and camera angle changes to an overhead view of the block. A lot of police vehicles have blocked the street and the citizens are held behind a police barricade. Cut to a line of police officers standing guard as the crowd boo and jeer at the policemen. Cut to a frontal shot of the team.)

Asami: Wait a second, these people aren't armed or dangerous.
Korra: Sure doesn't look that way.

(The whine of a microphone sounds and they turn towards the noise. Camera cuts to Saikhan standing on top of an armored police truck holding a microphone in his hands and addressing the crowd.)

Saikhan: All nonbenders, return to your homes immediately!
Nonbender Man: (Cut to a random man in the crowd) Yeah, as soon as you turn our power back on! (The people around him cheer in agreement while the camera returns back to Saikhan.)
Saikhan: Disperse, or you will all be arrested!
Nonbender Woman: (Cut to a random woman in the crowd holding a toddler in her arms) You benders can't treat us this way!
Child: Mommy, look! It's the Avatar!

(The child points off screen and the crowd turns towards Korra. Cut to the back view of the woman as she makes her way towards the police barricade while the policemen close in to stop her.)

Nonbender Woman: Please, help us. (Cut to a frontal shot of the woman) You're our Avatar too! 

(Cut to Korra looking lost as the camera pans across the worried crowd. The camera returns back to Korra as she shoves the metalbender cops aside.)

Korra: Everyone please stay calm. I'm gonna put a stop to this! 

(She walks away and we cut to Saikhan adjusting his hat irritably. Cut to a frontal shot of Korra as she stops and turns. Camera angle changes to show that she is looking at Tarrlok standing outside a tent talking to a police officer.)

Korra: Tarrlok! (Cut to a close up of Tarrlok as he turns towards Korra) You need to turn the power back on and leave these people alone!
Tarrlok: (frowns) Avatar Korra, you and your playmates have no business here!
Korra: (Cut to Korra staring at Tarrlok angrily) We're not going anywhere! You don't have the right to treat these innocent people like criminals. (Cut to a side view shot of the entire scene)
Tarrlok: This is an Equalist rally. (points to the crowd) There's nothing innocent about it.
Asami: (steps forward) They're not Equalists. They're just normal people who want their rights back.
Tarrlok: (incensed) They are the enemy! (turns towards the cops) Round up all these Equalists!

(Cut to an overhead view of the block as the cops approach the crowd. Cut to their boots as they stomp on the ground and camera quickly pans up to show their arms outstretched in a bending gesture. The supports of the barricade fall apart, leaving the red and white barricade boards floating in the air. The crowd begins to panic when the boards move towards them and they attempt to retreat. Cut to the cops as they perform a metalbending gesture simultaneously and we return back to a small group in the crowd as the barricade board encircles them. Screaming ensues and camera zooms out to show most of the crowd being trapped by the boards. Cut back to the cops again as they stomp their feet and bring their hands up. We return back to the crowd as the earth beneath them comes off the ground. Cut to the rest of the crowd who yell in fear and they begin to run away. Cut to the inside of a police truck as it opens up to a group from the crowd. Cut to a worried Korra as she rushes forward.)

Korra: Stop!

(Korra proceeds to earthbend the floating earth back to the ground and the people who are trapped immediately go under the board to escape their confines. Cut to Tarrlok growling with anger and he looks to the side. Camera cuts to show that he is looking at Asami. We return back to Tarrlok as he waterbends a water whip around her wrist and pulls her back.)

Asami: (groans and turns to face Tarrlok) Hey, let me go! 
Tarrlok: (tugs the whip and pulls Asami towards him) You're under arrest! 
Mako: (in disbelief) What? You can't do that! 
Tarrlok: (Cut to Tarrlok pulling Asami to the cops as they cuff her) Actually I can. She's a nonbender out past curfew and her father is a known Equalist conspirator.
Mako: (Cut to a furious Mako) Let her go! 
Tarrlok: (Camera returns back to Tarrlok) Arrest him, and his brother! 

(He points towards the siblings and camera cuts to the brothers as metal cables twirl around their torso. They struggle as they are dragged towards the cops. Cut to a pissed off Korra.)

Korra: Tarrlok!

(Camera zooms out as she bends two slabs off earth from the ground and holds them in the air threateningly. Cut to a side view shot of the confrontation.)

Tarrlok: (Zoom in on an angry Tarrlok who speaks calmly) Unless you want to join your friends in prison, I suggest you put those down and go back to the Air Temple.
Mako: (Cut to a close up of Korra as Mako talks off screen) Korra, listen to him! It's not worth it.

(Korra relents and slowly lowers her hands as the slabs crumble back to the ground. Cut to Korra's back view looking at Tarrlok as the brothers are taken away. Cut to a close up of Bolin as he is led into the police truck)

Bolin: We'll be all right!
Korra: (Cut back to Korra who hollers)  Don't worry, I'll call Tenzin! He can get you out!

(Cut back to Korra's back view looking at the police as Mako steps into another truck. He looks at Korra sadly and the back door of the truck slams shut. Cut to a distraught Korra.)

Tarrlok: (off screen) So sad to see your little Team Avatar (Korra's expression changes to anger as she turns towards Tarrlok and the camera pans to the left to show Tarrlok) broken up. You had a good run.
Korra: (Cut to a frontal shot of an angry Korra as she points a finger at Tarrlok) This isn't over, Tarrlok!
Tarrlok: (We return back to Tarrlok as he replies smugly) Oh, I believe it is. Take them away!

(We cut to the front of a police vehicle as it drives away, leaving dust trails behind. Korra can only look on, helpless. Fade to black for commercial break.)



Act III

(The scene opens with an establishing shot of the police station. The camera tilts down to Tenzin walking up the steps. Cut to inside where Tenzin is walking up to the front desk where Korra is. The officer at the desk she is talking to turns and leaves to her annoyance.)

Korra: Hey! Ugh!
Tenzin: I came as fast as I could. Are your friends all right?
Korra: I don't know, these knuckleheads won't tell me anything!
Tenzin: I'll take care of this. (footsteps are heard, and Korra and Tenzin look to see Saikhan walking by. He turns and is shocked to see them. He turns away to avoid them, but Tenzin stops him) Saikhan, a word please.
Saikhan: Councilman Tenzin. I'm pretty swamped at the moment. Can this wait? 
Tenzin: No it cannot. Three of Avatar Korra's friends were wrongly arrested tonight. I'd like you to release them immediately.
Saikhan: They're not going anywhere. They were interfering with police business.
Korra: Your so-called police business was rounding up innocent people and claiming they were Equalists! They should be released too!
Saikhan: All Equalist suspects are being detained indefinitely. They will be freed if and when the task force deems they are no longer a threat.
Tenzin: Those people are titled to due process under the law!
Saikhan: You'll have to take that up with Councilman Tarrlok.
Tenzin: Oh I plan to. At the council meeting, first thing in the morning.

(Cut to a close up of Saikhan as he glares, then cut to a medium shot as Korra leans in towards him.)

Korra: (pointing, then grabbing Saikhan's chin) You're officially the worst Chief of Police ever!

(Tenzin takes Korra by the shoulder and pulls her away.)

Tenzin: Calm down, Korra, I'll get this sorted out, we just need to be patient. (Korra and Tenzin turn to leave. After a few steps, Tenzin turns back to address Saikhan) But you really are the worst! (points) Ever! 

(Korra and Tenzin leave. Cut to an establishing shot of Air Temple Island at night as the snow falls. Cut to an overhead shot inside Korra's room and zoom in as she lies on her bed with the lamp on. Naga is lying on the floor. Cut to a close shot of Korra as she grunts and pounds her fist on the bed in frustration before sitting up. Cut to a shot of the window from outside as Korra opens it. She looks out over the bay at Republic City, then turns back around. Korra walks up to Naga and puts a hand on her back.)

Korra: Wake up Naga. Let's go. (cut to an establishing shot of City Hall. Cut to Korra and Naga approaching the building from the side. Korra dismounts) Wait for me here, girl. (Naga nuzzles Korra and she hugs her back) Don't worry, I'll be all right. (Korra walks towards the building. Cut to a shot of Tarrlokís office from outside the window. Heís at his desk with his secretary. Behind him is a carved mural with a waterfall over it. Cut to a closer shot of Tarrlok writing, when he and the secretary are startled by a crash, and a wind blows in, blowing away his papers. Cut to a shot of Korra standing in the window, with snow blowing in) You and I need to talk.

(Tarrlok glares at Korra as she walks up to the desk.)

Tarrlok: (to the secretary) Are any of the other council members here?
Council Page: I believe everyone has gone home for the night.
Tarrlok: Then you should do the same.
Council Page: (hesitates a moment) Are you sure, sir?
Tarrlok: Leave us. (the secretary bows and leaves the room) You obviously have something on your mind. Spit it out.
Korra: Don't you see? You're doing exactly what Amon says is wrong with benders! You're using your power to oppress and intimidate people! 
Tarrlok: And you don't?
Korra: Of... of course not! 
Tarrlok: Isn't that what you came here to do? Intimidate me into releasing your friends? (cut to Korra for a moment as she glares silently) See, that's what I admire about you, Korra. Your willingness to go to extremes in order to get what you want. It is a quality we both share.
Korra: You and I are nothing alike! 
Tarrlok: Look, I'll make you a deal. You fall in line, and do what I say, and I'll release your friends.
Korra: That's why you arrested them? To get to me?
Tarrlok: I need your answer.
Korra: No. You might be able to manipulate Chief Saikhan into following you, but it won't work on me.

(Tarrlok stands up and turns around, facing the waterfall.)

Tarrlok: You will regret that decision.
Korra: You need to be stopped! You're just as bad as Amon! 

(Cut to a close up of Tarrlok's eyes as they go wide in reaction to Korra's words. Cut to a shot from behind Tarrlok and pan up so we can see his reflection in the water.)

Tarrlok: I've tried to work with you, Korra. But you've made it impossible.

(Tarrlok swiftly turns around and throws a blade of water at Korra and cutting his desk in half. Korra dodges the attack. It cuts off some strands of hair and smashes into the bookshelf behind her as she rolls out of the way. Korra earthbends the floor at Tarrlok, knocking him back into the waterfall. She then lunges and shoots two streams of fire from her fists at Tarrlok. Tarrlok waterbends a bubble around himself to block the attack. After the attack stops, Tarrlok begins throwing little shards of ice at Korra in rapid succession. Korra back flips to dodge, and the scene goes into slow motion as it cuts to a close up of her in the air. Korra is pushed back against the wall. She grunts and dodges and deflects the shards with her fists as the scene goes into slow motion and we cut to a close up again. One shard grazes her side and she grunts in pain. Tarrlok continues the hail of ice, and Korra lifts up a large stone slab with earthbending to defend herself. Korra grunts as she swings her arms around, and earthbends the mural behind the waterfall. The mural rotates and catches Tarrlok by surprise, knocking him through the wall. He stumbles over the railing, but catches it before he falls.

Tarrlok catches his breath, his hair a mess, and looks up at the battle worn Korra as she stands in front of the hole on the wall.)

Korra: Still think I'm a half-baked Avatar? (bends the floor and knocks Tarrlok down to ground level. Korra jumps down and creates a shockwave and crater when she lands in front of Tarrlok. Cut to a close up as she pants and stands up) What are you gonna do now? You're all out of water, pal!

(Korra begins to approach Tarrlok as he crawls backward. She raised her palms up and creates flames in each hand. Korra lets out a battle cry as she lunges at Tarrlok. Tarrlok stands and holds his hands out, making Korra stop in her tracks and causing the flames to fly to either side of Tarrlok. Korra grunts in pain a moment, then Tarrlok moves his hands, causing Korra's arms to twist back. She groans in pain as Tarrlok holds his stance, and his hand movements force her to her knees.)

Tarrlok: You're in my way, Avatar, and you need to be removed!
Korra: (paralyzed and terrified) You're... you're a... bloodbender?
Tarrlok: Very observant. 
Korra: Itís... not a full moon how... how are you doing this?
Tarrlok: There are a lot of things you don't know about me.

(Tarrlok twists Korra around before throwing her against a pillar. Cut to Korra as she falls to the floor and looks stunned. Cut to Korra's point of view as she watches Tarrlok approach her before her vision blurs and fades out. Cut to a flashback dream of the close up of Yakone's eyes, then to a shot of Sokka in pain, then to Toph throwing a metal cable out. Cut to a different angle showing the cable headed for Yakone before Toph is blood bent and the cable falls. Cut to a shot of Yakone looking back and chuckling as Aang reaches out towards him, then cut to a close up of Aang paralyzed. The scene fades back to Korra's point of view as she wakes up in the back of a truck, groaning, Tarrlok is about to close the door. Cut to a shot of Korra showing her tied up.)

Korra: Where are you taking me?
Tarrlok: Somewhere where no one will find you. Say goodbye to Republic City, Avatar Korra! You'll never see it again.

(Korra sits up and roars at Tarrlok, breathing fire at him. Tarrlok closes the doors and avoids the fire just in time. Tarrlok slams his fist against the door and walks around to the front. Cut to a close up of Korra's profile.)

Korra: You can't do this! Let me out!

(Korra yells as the engine starts and the truck drives off. Cut to a shot of it driving down the city streets, then to a profile shot of Tarrlok, looking grim. Cut again to the truck driving down the streets at night, then tilt up to a shot of the mountains and the crescent moon in the sky.)
