those things. (The camera pans across the room full of teen boys) But for some reason when I meet boys they act as if I'm going to do something horrible to them.
Ty Lee: (laughs) But you probably would do something horrible to them. (Azula turns back toward Ty Lee, looking a bit sad) I'm sure they're just intimidated by you. Ok, look, if you want a boy to like you just look at him (close shot of Ty Lee) and smile a lot and laugh at everything he says, even if it's not funny.

Zuko: Well, at least I feel something...as opposed to you. You have no passion for anything. (raising his arms is the air) You're just a big "blah".

Katara attempts to stop his next explosion with water bending, but her efforts are turned into a cloud of steam. Appa roars. Cut to shot of Combustion Man standing in the great steam cloud.

Cut to wide shot of the Mansion on Ember Island. Cut to shot of Azula, approaching the mansion. Zuko is sitting on the steps holding his childhood handprint.)

Azula: I thought I'd find you here.

(Cut to shot of Zuko's profile looking at his small handprint, Azula stands in the background)

Zuko: Those summers we spent here seem so long ago. So much has changed.
Azula: (she gestures down the steps) Come down to the beach with me. (she starts down the steps) Come on, this place is depressing.

(Zuko follows her and the camera pans down to the handprint, left alone on the porch. Cut to wide view of the camera panning down Ember Island Beach. Zuko and Azula are walking side by side toward Mai and Ty Lee. Close shot of Zuko looking toward Mai and then looking away. Close shot of Mai looking angry and a bit sad.)

Mai: Hey... (Interrupted)
Zuko: (close shot of Zuko) Where's your new boyfriend? (Mai turns away angrily. Zuko comes and sits next to her) Are you cold? (he puts his arm around her, but she slaps it away)
Ty Lee: I'm freezing.
Zuko: (close shot of Zuko smiling) I'll make a fire. (The camera pans upward toward the cliffside and then the mansion) There's plenty of stuff to burn in there.

(Cut to close-up shot of Combustion Man's forehead. He growls and the camera zooms out to a full body shot, as he shoots another beam from his forehead. Cut to a shot of the beam flying through a cloud of steam toward some rocks and exploding.

Cut to the Aang and his friends hiding behind a rock, crouched and covering their heads for the explosion. They sit back up. 

Sokka: This is crazy! How can we beat a guy who blows things up with his mind?
Aang: (Aang crawls forward) We can. Jump on Appa. I'll try to
distract him. 

(Aang runs into the cloud of steam and disappears. The camera pans upward and Aang emerges from the top of the cloud and springs up the cliff face. Another beam explodes next to Aang. Cut to a shot of Aang jumping down the other side of the cliff, the orange cloud from the explosion still behind him. Aang slides down the back of the cliff into a field full of rock pillars. 

Cut to a shot of Combustion Man running. Cut back to Aang running through the pillars. He chooses one and hides behind it. Combustion Man slides down the back of the cliff face toward Aang. Cut to a shot of Aang breathing hard, his back to a pillar. The camera pans right as he peeks around the pillar and sees Combustion Man. Combustion Man sees him and stops. He shoots a beam toward Aang. Cut to an above shot. Aang's pillar explodes. He runs toward another one but it also explodes. Cut to another shot of the field of pillars. Aang bounces from pillar to pillar, stopping behind one. He earth bends the pillar toward Combustion Man, but it explodes before hitting him. Another beam is directed toward Aang. In slow motion he bends a wall of air around the explosion and is sent flying backward. Cut to a shot of Aang flying through the night sky. He turns and punches through an on-coming pillar of rocks. 

Cut to a wide shot of Combustion man running though the field of pillars. He stops where Aang should have landed and looks around. Cut to a close shot of Combustion Man's forehead. Combustion Man walks by a pillar of rocks. The camera zooms in to reveal Aang is hiding inside the wall of rocks, with only his eyes visible. Combustion Man stops and takes another look at Aang pillar. Aang burtst through covered in rock armor. Cut to wide shot of an explosion and Aang is sent flying into the air. As he falls back downward toward the earth, Appa flies into the shot and picks up Aang. Cut to shot of everyone on Appas back. Katara holds Aang tightly.)

Aang: (out of breath) I'm ok. (Momo jumps on to Aang's back)
Toph: Well, that was random.
Katara: I don't think so. I get the feeling he knows who we are. (looks at Aang)

(Cut to close shot of a fire. Zuko's family portrait is thrown into the flames. The camera closes in on young Zukos picture as it burns to ashes. Cut to shot of Zuko standing over the fire as Ty lee sits nearby.)

Ty Lee: What are you doing? 
Zuko: What does it look like I'm doing? 

(Cut to above shot of Zuko's legs next to the fire and the burning family portrait. The camera pans upward.)

Ty Lee: But it's a painting of your family.
Zuko: You think I care?
Ty Lee: (voice over) I think you do.
Zuko: You don't know me, so why don't you just mind your own business! (He turns away from her)
Ty Lee: (Close shot of Ty Lee, who looks down and speaks softly) I know you.

(Cut back to shot of Zuko and Ty Lee by the fire)

Zuko: No, you don't. (he waves his arm angrily) You're stuck in your little Ty Lee world, where everything's great all the time.

(Cut to shot of Mai sitting on a rock near the fire. Zuko looks toward her)

Mai: Zuko, leave her alone.
Zuko: (mocking) 'I'm so pretty, look at me. I can walk on my hands, whoo!' (Zuko does a hand stand. Cut to shot of Ty Lee looking sad. Cut back to Zuko who is upside down. He lets himself fall to the sand) Circus freak!

(Cut to shot of Ty Lee beginning to cry and Azula sits in the background)

Azula: (laughs)
Ty Lee: Yes, I'm a circus freak. Go ahead and laugh all you want. (gestures toward Azula, who looks away) You wanna know why I joined the circus?
Azula: Here we go.

(Cut to an above shot of the four teens around the fire)

Ty Lee: Do you have any idea what my home life was like, growing up with six sisters (cut to shot of Ty Lee) who look exactly like me? (she stands up) It was like, I didn't even have my own name. (she falls to the ground crying) I joined the circus because I was scared of spending the rest of my life as part of a matched set. At least, I'm different now. (close shot of teary-eyed Ty Lee) Circus freak is a compliment!
Mai: (sarcastically) Guess that explains why you need 10 boyfriends, too.

(Cut to shot of Ty Lee looking angrily toward Mai and putting her hands on her hips)

Ty Lee: I'm sorry, what?
Mai: Attention issues. You couldn't get enough attention when you were a kid, so (looking downward)  you're trying to make up for it now.

(Cut to shot of Ty Lee, who moves closer and closer to Mai with each accusation)

Ty Lee: Well, what's your excuse, Mai? You were an only child for 15 years, but even with all that attention, your aura is this dingy, pasty, gray...

(Cut to shot of Mai and Ty Lee)

Mai: I don't believe in auras.

(The camera pans right, towards Zuko. Zuko stands up) 

Zuko: Yeah, you don't believe in anything.

(Cut to close shot of Mai who looks depressed)

Mai: Oh, well, I'm sorry I can't be as high-strung and crazy as the rest of you.

(Cut to over-head shot of the four teens. Zuko walks closer to the fire and Mai.)

Zuko: I'm sorry, too. I wish you would be high-strung and crazy for once, (Close shot of Mai looking away and Zuko standing over her) instead of keeping all your feelings bottled up inside. She just called your aura dingy. Are you gonna take that?
Mai: (Cut to wide shot of the four of them. Mai lays back carelessly on the rock she is sitting on) What do you want from me? You want a teary confession about how hard my childhood was? Well, it wasn't. (close shot of Mai) I was a rich only child who got anything I wanted. As long as I behaved...(cut to shot of the clouds above) and sat still...and didn't speak unless spoken to. (cut to shot of Zuko listening) My mother said I had to keep out of trouble. (Cut to wide shot of the four of them around
the fire) We had my Dad's political career to think about.
Azula: Well, that's it, then. (close-up shot on Azula) You had a controlling mother who had certain expectations, and if you strayed from them you were shut down. That's why you're afraid to care about anything, and why you can't express yourself.
Mai: (close shot of Mai) You want me to express myself? (she stands and yells) Leave me alone!

(The camera pans right, over the four teens. Cut to shot of Mai's face angry in the foreground and Zuko in the background)

Zuko: I like it when you express yourself. (he reaches for her, but she backs away)
Mai: (yelling)Don't touch me. I'm still mad at you.
Zuko: My life hasn't been that easy, either, Mai. (Mai interrupts him)
Mai: Whatever- that doesn't excuse the way you've been acting.
Ty Lee: Calm down, you guys. (cut to Ty Lee and Azula sitting behind her) This much negative energy is bad for your skin. You'll totally break out.
Zuko: (angrily) Bad skin? (Ty Lee cringes. Cut to shot of Zuko looking toward her) Normal teenagers worry about bad skin. I don't have that luxury. My father decided to teach me a permanent lesson on my face. (Zuko points toward his scar)

(Cut to shot of Azula, Zuko and Ty Lee)

Ty  Lee: Sorry, Zuko, I...

(Zuko walks away from them and the camera follows him)

Zuko: For so long, I thought that if my dad accepted me, I'd be happy. I'm back home, now my dad talks to me. Huh, he even thinks I'm a hero. (cut to Azula, who smiles at these words) Everything should be perfect, right (cut to over-head wide shot of the four teens sitting around the fire) I should be happy now, but I'm not. I'm angrier than ever and I don't know why.
Azula: There's a simple question you need to answer then. (she
leans forward) Who are you angry at? 
Zuko: No one, (he looks down) I'm just angry.
Mai: Yeah, who are you angry at, Zuko?
Zuko: Everyone... (he covers his ears in frustration) I don't know.
Azula: Is it Dad? 
Zuko: No, no!
Ty Lee: Your uncle? 
Azula: Me?

(Cut back to shot of Zuko who shakes his head in frustration)

Zuko: No, no... No, no.
Mai: Then who? Who are you angry at?

(The camera quickly pans right, stopping on Azula)

Azula: (sternly) Answer the question, Zuko.
Ty lee: (pleading) Talk to us.

(Cut to shot of Zuko looking confused and frightened)

Mai: Come on, answer the question.
Azula: Come on, answer it.

(Cut to wide shot of group. For a moment there is silence)

Zuko: (yells suddenly) I'm angry at myself! 

(Zuko throws his arms down and the campfire bursts into a column of flame. The girls cover their eyes to protect themselves from the fire. Cut to a close shot of Zuko as wind and embers fly through his blowing hair. The fire burns out and the scene grows dark. Cut to a wide shot of the group)

Azula: Why? 

(Cut to shot of Zuko looking out at the sea with Azula sitting behind him)

Zuko: Because I'm confused. Because I'm not sure I know the difference between right and wrong anymore.
Azula: You're pathetic.

(Cut to shot of Zuko. His back is turned toward us as he looks out to sea. Mai approaches him and puts her arm around him.)

Mai: I know one thing I care about... (Cut to shot of Mai smiling at Zuko) I care about you. (Mai and Zuko kiss. Azula claps, causing them to separate and turn toward Azula. The camera pans left to include her.)
Azula: (still clapping slowly) Well, those were wonderful performances, everyone.
Zuko: I guess you wouldn't understand, (pulls Mai to him) would you, Azula (sarcastically) Because you're just so perfect.

Azula: Well, yes, I guess you're right. I don't have sob stories like all of you. I could sit here and complain how our mom liked Zuko more than me, but I don't really care. (Cut to shot of the burning embers left from the fire) My own mother...(cut to shot of the embers reflected in Azula's eyes) thought I was a monster. (cut to Mai and Zuko. Then to Ty Lee, who looks on concerned. Cut back to a wide shot of the whole group, Azula sitting in the center of the shot) She was right, of course, but it still hurt.

Ty Lee: What Lo and Li said came true. The beach did help us learn about ourselves. (Cut to close shot of Ty Lee. She picks up a smooth stone) I feel all smoothed. I'll always remember this.

(Cut back to wide shot of the group.)

Azula: You know what would make this trip
really memorable? 

(Close shot of Azula looking devious.

Cut to shot of Chan opening the door of his house. The party is still going on behind him. He looks very confused. Cut to Azula and her companions waiting to be let in.)

Azula: We've got some bad news, Chan. 

(The camera zooms in on Zuko's face as he turns toward Chan.)

Zuko: Party's over.

(Cut to an antique vase smashing on the floor. Cut to Zuko kicking a table full of food in half as party-goers run away screaming. Close shot of Chan full of fear. Cut to Mai who throws a knife down a wall cutting five tapestries in half. Cut back to Chan who is still in shock and looks up suddenly. The camera pans upwards to where Ty Lee is crouched in the rafters. She swings down and pulls down two chandeliers which come crashing to the floor. Cut to shot of Chan sobbing with Azula standing behind him. Her arms crossed and she looks pleased. Cut to a final blurred shot of Azula, Ty Lee, Mai and Zuko linked arm in arm very pleased with themselves. A wall of flame right behind them.)
