["Previously on The Legend of Korra" sequence, using clips from "And The Winner Is..."]

Tarrlok: (first seen standing at a podium for a press conference, with Republic City police standing in line behind him, but then continues as a voice over for the clips) Although the Hundred Year War has long passed, we are not living in a time of peace. These revolutionaries who call themselves "Equalists" are not interested in equality at all. They just want to wage war against benders. Chief Bei Fong was supposed to protect Republic City, but she was powerless to stop Amon's attack on the arena. She has failed us all. If we are to survive these dire times, our law enforcement needs new leadership.



Act I

(The scene opens with an overhead view of the Pro-Bending Arena building. The glass dome is broken in places, and construction scaffolding is in place around it. Some cars are parked near the entrance, which is blocked off by a police barricade. The view shifts to show Korra riding Naga up the path to the entrance, with some Metalbender police milling around in the background. The polarbear-dog comes to stop just before a line of police tape, and Korra immediately hops off and yanks the tape up to duck under it.

The scene changes to Mako and Bolin's attic apartment. The view shows a closeup of Mako placing some folded clothes into a half-full box.)

Mako: I still don't believe they're shutting this place down. (grabs the box and stands up to reveal Bolin sitting behind him)
Bolin: (wistful) Yeah, we had some good memories here, didn't we?
Korra: (voice coming from the stairwell) Guys, great news. (emerges from the stairs into the apartment) You don't have to go back on the streets. I talked to Tenzin and made all the arrangements. You can come live on Air Temple Island with me.
Mako: (hesitant, scratching the back of his head with one hand) Oh, we'd love to, but-
Bolin: (excited) Asami already invited us to live in her dad's giant mansion! (The view cuts briefly to Korra, showing her surprised look.) From here on out (grabs Mako with one arm and waves the other out at an unseen horizon), it's going to be the lap of luxury for us.
Asami: (suddenly appearing in the background, holding Pabu, by leaning out from a previously unseen loft) Hey, Korra. (Korra's face freaks out.) I was hoping you'd stop by. (climbs down from the loft)
Korra: (subdued) I was just leaving. So... I guess I'll see you guys around... some time.
Asami: Why not tomorrow? I'd love to have you come visit the estate.
Korra: I don't know. I have some Avatar stuff to do.
Bolin: (doing a high-pitched voice with an accent from the American South, and waving Pabu in front of his face so that it looks like Pabu is talking) Come on, Korra. We all deserve a little rest and relaxation after all this craziness. We could swim in Asami's pool. It'll be fun!
Korra: (laughing) All right, Pabu.
Asami: Great, we'll see you tomorrow.

(Korra goes back down the stairs while everyone- Asami, Mako, and Bolin still using Pabu as a puppet- waves goodbye.

The scene shifts an outdoor location in sunny Republic City. In the foreground are a cluster of lizard crows picking food off the ground, and in the distance behind them is a dingy warehouse. The lizard crows are disturbed by the sound of an approaching vehicle, and take off just before a police truck can run over them as it speeds toward the warehouse. It busts through the building's door as the view shifts to the interior, and Metalbenders break through the warehouse's windows and repel down to the ground. Additional forces come out of the truck. The Metalbenders stream through the building and pull tarps off of abandoned machinery. One of them finds a table stacked with flyers bearing Amon's image. Another opens a crate to find it filled with the same electric gloves used to assault the Pro-Bending Arena. The view shifts to show Chief Ling Bei Fong overseeing the raid.)

Lin: Looks like our intel was good.
Saikhan: There's enough evidence here to bury Cabbage Corp for an eternity.

(The scene shifts to pan down over a tall building with a gold rooftops. A small crowd is gathering at the entrance. The camera zooms in past a statue of a historic Cabbage Merchant standing next to a cart full of his product, holding a head of cabbage aloft with triumph.)

Lau: (being led out the building's entrance by Saikhan, with Lin following closely.) This is an outrage, I'm innocent!
Saikhan: Yeah, yeah. That's what they all say.

(Lin pauses as press cameras begin flashing in front of her.)

Reporter: Is it true that Cabbage Corp is conspiring with the Equalists?
Lin: The evidence points in that direction, but the investigation is ongoing. For the time being we have frozen Mr. Gan-Lan's assets and are closing Cabbage Corp.
Lau: (tearing up) No, not my Cabbage Corp!

(The scene jumps to an exterior view the Police headquarters, and then goes inside to the front hall. Korra is waiting, standing and staring at her reflection in the polished wooden floor.)

Tahno: (lethargic) Hey, Korra. (The view pans up with Korra's gaze to find Tahno hunched on a bench. His hair is hanging loosely and he has dark circles under his eyes.)
Korra: (surprised) Tahno? (sits down and starts speaking softly) Listen. I know we're not exactly "best friends," but I'm sorry Amon took your bending.
Tahno: I've been to the best healers in the city. Whatever Amon did to me, it's permanent. (becomes intense) You gotta get him for me.

(Korra nods, her face hard. She hears Lin talking, and looks over to find the Chief and Tenzin walking with Hiroshi Sato.)

Lin: Mr. Sato, if you remember anything else about what you saw during Amon's attack, be sure to let us know.
Hiroshi: I'm happy to help any way I can. I want these Equalists to pay for what they've done.
Tenzin: (looking to Tahno) We're ready for you now.
Tahno: (stands, turns to Korra, and gives her a casual salute and smile) See you around, Avatar.

(Tahno walks away, and scene changes to the Sato Estate. The camera flies up past the front gate and follows the path uphill, past various buildings, to the main mansion at the highest point. The scene cuts inside to a Lionturtle statue with a waterfall pouring out of its carved mouth. Pabu squeals and takes a flying leap off the statue's head to dive into the large pool. The view shifts to show the whole room, decorated luxuriously with carved golden walls, lawn furniture, and potted plants. Bolin is poised to dive off the statue's head, and on the opposite side of the pool Asami is sitting at the edge dipping her feet while Mako stands in the water beside her.)

Bolin: Earthbending bomb! (He jumps into the pool, splashing the others, as a butler enters the room leading a gawking Korra.)
Butler: Avatar Korra has arrived.
Mako: (waves) Hey, Korra.
Asami: Glad you made it.
Bolin: (emerges from the water with a splash) Welcome to paradise. (sinks down to float on his back with Pabu perched on top of him)
Korra: (sits down on a lounge chair, speaking with bemusement) Looks like you guys settled right in.
Mako: (wading) Pretty much, except someone forgot to ask her father if we could stay here.
Asami: (wading beside Mako) Yeah, but I smoothed it over with him. It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.
Bolin: (emerges from the water beside Korra, dripping, with Pabu on his head) This is the greatest place in the world. Watch this. (to the butler) Fetch me my towel, good sir.
Butler: Yes, Master... Bolin. (grabs towel)
Bolin: "Master Bolin." (points his thumb at the butler and laughs) I love this guy. Now pat me dry.
Butler: As you wish. (quickly rubs Bolin dry)
Bolin: Don't forget Master Pabu.
Butler: Wouldn't dream of it, Sir.

(He loops the towel over Pabu, still on Bolin's head, and speed-buffs the ferret. As soon as the towel is taken away, Pabu's fur puffs out. Bolin grins and jumps back into the water. The Butler slumps with annoyance, a vein comically popping in his forehead.)

Korra: (to Asami as she wades close) So, what do you have planned for us today? (false, weary cheer) Let me guess: shopping, makeovers?
Bolin: (pushes Mako under the water, and turns to raise his hand) Ooh, Ooh! I vote makeovers! (Mako pops back up and shoves Bolin underwater in retaliation.)
Asami: (emerging from the pool) I have something a little more exciting in mind.

(The scene cuts to a professional driving course, where two racing Satomobiles jockey for the lead. The camera follows them as they pass the finish line, revealing Korra and friends watching from the stands.)

Asasmi: Pretty cool, huh?
Korra: (smiling) Way cooler than a makeover.
Asami: This is where Future Industries test drives their Satomobiles. Ever been behind the wheel?
Korra: The only thing I know how to drive is a polar bear dog
Asami: You want me to take you for a spin?
Korra: (eyes wide, excited) Let's do it.

(The view cuts to the starting line, where two Satomobiles are revving their engines. A helmeted Korra and Asami are in one, with the latter in the driver's seat. Asami looks over at her opponent, and he smirks back. A referee waves the white starting flag, and both cars take off past him. The challenger, driving the red car, cuts Asami's gold car off on a turn they both take in a skid. They hit a straightaway as Asami smirks and guns the engine, passing her opponent. The view jumps over to show Mako and Bolin cheering in the stands.)

Mako and Bolin: Yeah!
Bolin: Woohoo!

(Back on the racetrack, Asami is once again in second place. She gains on her opponent, but he notices and moves his car to block her. Asami's eyes narrow. She shifts gears and works the pedals to get more speed out of her vehicle. The car moves closer to the track's inside and creeps up. The wheels scrape up against the road's border, sending up sparks and smoke, but it continues to overtake the red car. Korra looks at the scraping wheel with concern, then over at the other driver as she passes him. He guns his car forward, but his front wheel collides with the gold car's rear wheel, pushing the red car off balance and into a spin. The challenger falls behind as the gold car continues onward. Korra looks back at the spinning red car, then forward at Asami with a big grin. Their car crosses the finish line, followed shortly by the still-spinning red car. Asami smiles and pulls into the pit.

Once the car comes to a stop, Korra hops out. Asami emerges more slowly, taking off her helmet.)

Korra: That was amazing! I didn't think we'd make it.
Asami: (fluffing her hair) Well, you can't be afraid to mix it up sometimes.
Korra: (removes helmet) I gotta admit I had you pegged wrong. I thought you were kind of prissy. (concerned) No offense.
Asami: (laughs) It's all right. People usually assume that I'm daddy's helpless little girl, but I can handle myself. I mean, I've been in self defense classes since I was this high. (motions indicating half her current height) My dad made sure I would always be able to protect myself.
Korra: Smart guy.

(Back at the mansion, the butler opens the door to find the group returned from the racetrack. Bolin is doing the 'potty dance' while Mako is slapping his forehead in embarrassment.)

Bolin: Emergency! Emergency, coming through! Beep, beep! (runs deeper into the mansion leaving a smoke trail)
Korra: Uh, is there another bathroom I can use?
Asami: We have a ladies' powder room upstairs. First door on your right. (Mako steps behind Asami and puts a hand on her shoulder.) You can freshen up in there.
Korra: Thanks.

(The scene cuts to Korra washing her hands in the sink. She shuts off the water and dries with the towel, then notices a powder puff beside the sink. With trepidation, she lifts the puff by its handle, and raises it to her face. She hesitates, gazing at the unfamiliar instrument, then shuts her eyes and roughly slams the puff onto her face. A cloud of powder explodes outward to completely hide her whole upper body, sending Korra into a coughing fit. She emerges from the bathroom still coughing and waving floating powder from her face. As she walks away, she overhears Hiroshi's muffled voice coming from behind a closed door.)

Hiroshi: (voice over, muted) No, no, I assure you. Everything is going exactly as planned. (Korra's face hardens, and she looks around to make sure no one is watching before she sneaks to the door to peak through the keyhole.) Mhhm, yes. Luckily the Cabbage Corp investigation has bought us enough time. (Through the keyhole, she sees Hiroshi sitting at his desk with his back turned towards the door.) Trust me. By the end of the week, we'll be ready to strike.

(Hiroshi slams the handset down on the phone, and Korra jumps up with alarm. She visibly struggles with her thoughts before running back down the hall.

In the main hall, Mako and Asami are watching as Bolin poses for the butler, who is squirting perform at Bolin. Korra runs past without even looking at them.)

Asasmi: You're leaving? But I-I thought-
Korra: (turns around as she continues to walk towards the door) Sorry, I forgot I'm supposed to airsit, I mean babybend, I-I mean babysit the airbender kids. See you later.

(She dashes out the door, and the others are left to stare in surprise. Fade to commercial break.)



Act II

(It is night in Republic City. Spotlight traverse the sky, and a Metalbender airship floats lazily above the city. The camera pans down to show Korra, Tenzin, and Lin having a conversation beneath the city's skyscrapers.)

Tenzin: So you think Mr. Sato manufactured those gloves for the Equalists, then framed Cabbage Corp?
Lin: That's a bold accusation, but what proof do you have?
Korra: Well I don't exactly have proof, but I know what I heard. Sato's up to something.
Lin: He does have the means... and he has a motive.
Tenzin: That's right.
Korra: A motive? What is it?
Tenzin: Twelve years ago, the Agni Kai Triad robbed Sato's mansion. (sad) A firebender killed Sato's wife during the break-in.
Korra: (sorrowful) That's terrible.
Tenzin: It was tragic. It's possible he's been harboring anti-bending sentiment all this time.
Lin: Maybe we should look at Mr. Sato a little more closely.

(The view is filled by a close up of the doors to the Sato mansion. They are opened by the butler, whose eyes widen and face falls at the sight of the off-screen visitors. Mako and Asami are glimpsed coming down the stairs in the background when the view cuts to show Lin, Tenzin, and Korra walking in with determination. The trio passes Mako and Asami on the staircase's first landing. Surprised, Mako grabs Korra by the shoulder.)

Mako: What's going on? Why are they asking Hiroshi more questions?
Korra: I overheard him on the phone yesterday. Asami, I don't know how to tell you this, but I think your father might be involved with the Equalists.
Asami: (outraged) What? I don't believe this. (walks off to follow Lin and Tenzin)
Mako: You spied on Hiroshi? What's your problem?

(Mako stalks up the stairs, leaving Korra by herself. She looks down with disapointment.

The scene cuts to Hiroshi's office. He is sitting at his desk in the foreground, his back to the camera. Lin and Tenzin are standing side-by-side.)

Lin: Mr. Sato, we just have a few follow-up questions for you.
Asami: (barging in through the door and walking around to Hiroshi's side) My father is innocent. Just because we're not benders doesn't mean we support those awful Equalists!
Hiroshi: (surprised) Equalists? Is that what this is about? I can assure you I have nothing to do with those radicals.
Mako: Yeah, you don't know what you're talking about, Korra.
Korra: (gives Mako a defiant look, then turns to face and point at Hiroshi) I overheard you on the phone. You said the Cabbage Corp investigation bought you time and you're getting ready to strike. Explain that.
Hiroshi: (laughs heartily) This is all just a misunderstanding. Resulting from the young Avatar's overactive imagination. My number one competitor was knocked out of the game. It's providing me an opportunity to strike the market with a new line of Satomobiles. It's just business, nothing nefarious.
Tenzin: (sharing a look with Lin) In order to put all suspicions to rest, might we have a look into your factories and warehouses?

(Asami gives a loud, angry sigh, and looks like she's about to speak, but Hiroshi holds up a hand to settle her.)

Hiroshi: If you feel it's necessary, you're welcome to search all of Future Industries.

(The scene changes to the unique-looking Future Industries factory. It has four smokestacks, one at each corner of the building. Two Metalbender airships are hovering in the sky around the factory.)

Broadcaster: (voice over) Is it possible presidents of Cabbage Corp and Future Industries both have Equalist ties? (The view goes inside to the factory's loading bay. Trucks and forklifts are scattered about, while Metalbenders search through stacks of boxes. Korra has Naga sniffing around.) Or did Hiroshi Sato frame his long time rival, Lau Gan-Lan? Or did Chief Bei Fong just plain arrest the wrong man? (Link breaks open a crate with the metal wire whips built into her armor.) So far the investigation has yielded no evidence to incriminate Sato. (Throughout the factory, Metalbenders are breaking open crates with their whips and searching the contents.)

(The scene cuts to outside the factory. One of the airships has come down out of the twilight sky to hover right next to the building. Lin and Tenzin watch as the police using their grappling whips to ascend into the airship's bay. Korra comes from off-camera riding Naga and approaches her mentors. She leaps down to talk to them.)

Korra: I can't believe we didn't find anything.
Lin: It would appear Hiroshi is innocent.

(Asami and Mako walk over from off-camera, and Asami puts her hands on her hips as she confronts the others.)

Asami: (hostile) Okay. You did your search. Now you can all leave.

(Lin stares Asami down and grunts, not going anywhere. Mako catches Korra's gaze and steps off to the side. She follows him to where they can converse apart from the others. Asami and Lin watch them from the background.)

Mako: So, I hope you're convinced now.
Korra: (angry) No, I'm not. I don't care how cooperative Hiroshi is being, I know he's lying.
Mako: Why are you doing this? (points) Are you that jealous of me and Asami?
Korra: (Korra gasps loudly and leans forward with clenched fists) What? Don't be ridiculous. That has nothing to do with it.
Mako: If you don't drop this, consider our friendship over.
Korra: (stares at Mako, then closes her eyes and looks down) I'm sorry. (opens her eyes) Hiroshi is not the man you think he is.

(Mako just grunts, then walks away to join Asami. She glares at Korra even as Mako puts an arm around her and leads her away. Korra closes her eyes again and sighs before walking off in the opposite direction.

In the background, a man is pulling the factory's large door closed. The view cuts close to this worker, and he turns around to look at Korra with intense eyes. He heads in her general direction, unnoticed by anyone. Tenzin and Lin are still nearby, and Korra is petting Naga. The worker purposefully walks right past Korra, not quite looking at her, and discreetly puts a folded piece of paper in her free hand as he goes past. Korra's fingers tighten around it reflexively, and her eyes go wide with surprise. She quickly brings the paper up to examine it, then looks around to see where it might have come from. She catches sight of the worker as he boards a truck, surrounded by several of his fellows in identical uniforms. One waves as the truck drives off.

Korra opens the paper and reads it, then quickly turns to Tenzin and offers him the note.)

Korra: I think you guys should hear this. (reading off the paper) "If you want to find the truth, meet me under the north end of the Silk Road Bridge at midnight."

(The scene cuts to the Silk Road Bridge at the appointed hour. A crescent moon is almost fully obscured by clouds, and another Metalbender airship patrols the skies just above. The view pans down reveal Korra, Tenzin, and Lin walking beneath the metal structure. They stop when they hear a low hiss.)

Worker: Psst! Over here. (steps out from behind a metal strut as the others approach) Listen. I joined the Equalists because I believed in what Amon said. (fixes the collar of his jacket so that it rises and obscures his face from view) I thought he could make life better for us non-benders. But I didn't sign up for this, this war.
Lin: What do you have on Hiroshi Sato?
Worker: He manufactured those gloves for the Equalists.
Korra: I knew it.
Worker: And there are rumors he's working on something even bigger. Some new kind of weapon.
Tenzin: We searched all of Future Industries and found nothing.
Worker: That's because he has a secret factory.
Korra: Where?
Worker: It's right underneath the Sato mansion.

(Korra, Tenzin, and Lin's eyes all go wide, and the Avatar gasps. Fade to commercial break.)



Act III

(The view shows Republic City at night, lit up with golden light from its many tall buildings. A Metalbender airship is flying across the sky above. Within, Korra is crouched against the airship's wall. She takes a deep breath and exhales, then looks to her right where Tenzin and Lin are staring down at the city from the observation deck.)

Tenzin: Raiding the Sato mansion is a risky move with Tarrlok breathing down your neck. If we're wrong-
Lin: I know. I can kiss my job goodbye. But protecting Republic City is all I care about. We can't let Amon get his hands on this new weapon.

(An exterior shot shows the airshp arriving at the Sato estate. The towers and buildings are all lit. The view cuts to a room in the mansion, where Bolin, Mako and Asami are all sitting in chairs and relaxing. Sculptures line the back wall, and the low table in front of the trio boasts a phonograph and a large tray of fruit for Bolin. He has Pabu on his shoulder and lowers a bunch of grapes into his mouth, while Asami leans over to Mako and shows him a record sleeve.

Suddenly, the doors burst open and a team of Metalbenders rush in, all of them in ready Bending stances. They fan out across the room, followed by Lin and Tenzin.)

Asami: (outraged) What are you doing here? (The phonograph abruptly cuts out.)
Lin: We have reason to believe there is a factory hidden beneath the mansion.
Asami: I think I would have noticed if there were a factory underneath my house! (softer, looking away) The lies you people come up with just to persecute my father.
Tenzin: Where is your father?
Asami: In his workshop, behind the house.

(The scene moves to the exterior of the workshop. The Metalbenders are approaching slowly, covering each other's backs and spreading their line of vision out across the large grassy yard. The view cuts inside just as the Metalbenders burst through the door and move through the workshop. Plenty of junk and tools are lying around, but the center of the room is empty. Tenzin leads the others into the shop.)

Asami: (calling out) Dad? Hello?
Officer: Chief, the estate's been secured. No one has left the workshop since we arrived.
Lin: Perhaps we just couldn't see him leaving. (Lin ambles out into the center of the room, her hands clasped behind her back. She stops, turns around, then abruptly raises her leg tight against her body. The bottom of her metal boot retracts, revealing the bare foot within, then she stomps down on the floor. The view goes completely black, but is quickly lit up white shockwaves that travel out from Lin's foot and pass over everything in the room. It is exactly like Toph's old tremor-sense. As color returns and the view goes back to normal, Lin straightens from her stance.) There's a tunnel beneath the workshop, running deep into the mountain side.
Asami: What? (annoyed) There's no tunnel.

(Lin looks down at the empty patch of floor, then takes an Earthbending stances and rips a metal square out of the floor with a wave of both arms. The entire group approaches the whole and looks down. The camera pans out to reveal a braced, dark tunnel with an industrial elevator just below a flight of metal stairs. Asami looks crushed, Mako's eyebrows are raised, Korra simply stares grimly, and Bolin has a hesitant expression.)

Bolin: (whispering to Asami, from behind a hand.) Do you think your dad knows about this tunnel?
Asami: I don't understand. There must be an explanation
Korra: (gently) Maybe you don't know everything about your father. I'm sorry.
Lin: Officers, into the tunnel. Be cautious. (They snap from attention and file down the stairs, leaving Mako, Bolin, and Asami behind. The teens move to follow, but Lin's voice stops them.) Uh-uh. You three stay up here. Officer Song, keep an eye on them.

(Officer Song salutes while Lin goes to follow the other Metalbenders. Korra looks back at her friends, Mako front and center, as she and Tenzin follow Lin. Mako cannot hold her gaze, and looks to the side with a chagrined expression.

The scene cuts to the large elevator platform, as it follows a rail down the diagonally descending tunnel. The only light is a spotlight at the front of the elevator, and red emergency lighting throughout the shaft. Korra is leaning against a railing in the foreground, looking around. After a short ride, the elevator comes to a halt against a perpendicular walkway that leads off screen. The Metalbenders quickly follow it, moving in Bending stances.

They emerge into a brightly lit, massive room covered in crisscrossed metal bracing. Near the entrance, two massive banners bearing Amon's face hang from a rafter.)

Lin: Not your average backyard workshop.

(The view cuts over to show a line of machines parked up against a wall. Superficially human, they stand on legs that end in tank treads, boast a pair of massive clawed arms, and have bulbous heads that resemble first-generation diving helmets with large glass view-ports. The view shifts back to Korra and company, revealing more of the 'mechatanks' behind them.)

Korra: And I'm guessing those are the new weapons.

(The camera zooms in on one of the mechatanks, traveling over its metal skin and showing where the plates have been bolted together as armor. The view travels up and over the 'head,' turning around to show the group standing below at what seems like a significant vertical distance. The Metalbenders move to form a circle around Tenzin, Lin, and Korra.)

Tenzin: Hiroshi was lying all right, but where is he?

(Suddenly, a metal wall pops up from the floor behind them and completely cuts off the whole end of the room with the exit. Most of the lights go out, plunging the room into shadows.

Back in the workshop, Asami, Mako, and Bolin are staring down into the tunnel and hear the sound of the wall clamping shut.)

Bolin: What was that?
Mako: We need to get down there and see what's going on.
Song: Absolutely not. You're staying put until the chief comes back.
Mako: (looking at Bolin, who nods back and adopts an artificially nonchalant expression) All right, we'll stay put. But can we wait outside or something? It's so dusty in this workshop. (rubs nose, almost smiling)
Song: No. We're waiting right here.

(Bolin casually rubs a foot against the floor.)

Mako: Okay, but don't blame me if I start snee... if I start snee... if I start...
Song: What's your problem, bub?
Mako: I'm about to-

(Mako leans back as if to sneeze, then throws himself forward and spits out a massive flare of fire that sets Officer Song stumbling backwards. Bolin raises his foot, causing a small square pillar to pop out of the ground just behind Song. The Metalbender trips and flips to fall on his stomach, and Bolin quickly rushes over and leaps into a body-slam right on top of Song. Mako quickly comes over and helps Bolin pin Song down.

Cut to Office Song tied up to a barrel in the workshop and gagged. His hat is on the ground next to him. The view switches around to show Mako standing up, Bolin and Asami behind him.)

Mako: Sorry, pal. We know you were just doing your job.
Bolin: Yeah. (mocking) Just stay put until the chief come back. (quickly) That sounds very familiar, doesn't it? Why? Because you said it.

(The trio approaches the tunnel. Mako puts his hands on Asami's shoulders and stops her from continuing forward. Bolin continues on.)

Mako: Asami, you should stay here. We'll check it out.
Asami: I have to find out the truth about my father.
Mako: I understand. That's why I'm going down; to find out for you. Please.
Asami: All right. (Mako heads down the tunnel stairs.) Be careful.

(Mako turns back, sharing a last look with Asami.

Back in the secret factory, Lin rushes at the trapping wall and tries a Bending move to raise it. The wall doesn't respond.)

Hiroshi: (intercom voice over) I'm afraid you won't be able to metalbend that wall, Chief Bei Fong. (Sickly green spotlights start flipping on, causing the captives to flinch under the glare. The lights are shown to be coming from the mechatanks, which are powering on.) It's solid platinum. My mechatanks are platinum as well. (A group of the mechatanks drive over and form a half-circle around the Benders. The view cuts to Hirshi himself, in the cockpit of one of the mechatanks. he is clutching a steering lever in each hand.) Not even your renowned mother could bend a metal so pure.
Korra: (echoing from the other side of the mechatank's view-port) Hiroshi, I knew you were a lying. no-good Equalist. Come out here and-
Hiroshi: And do what, young Avatar? Face the wrath of your bending? No. I think I'll from inside here, where my odds are a little more... equal. (The camera zooms out, passing through the view-port to settle below the Benders.)
Lin: That source was a set-up. You lured us down here.
Hiroshi: Guilty as charged.

(Hiroshi pushes one of the control levers, and his mechatank shoots out a grappling claw. Lin, Tenzin, and Korra all jump out of the way. The other mechatanks move in. One smashes a claw down toward a group of Metalbenders, but they dodge and shoot out their whips to entangle the mechatank. Two other Metalbenders tangle up another of the vehicles, while Lin dodges another grappling hook attack and leaps up into the air above it. As she arcs through the air, she deploys large metal wrist blades out of her armor. As she lands on the mechatank, she punches at the cockpit's main window and drives the blade in as far as it will reach. The view cuts inside the cockpit, where a masked Equalist shifts out of the way of the blade. More blade attacks burst in through the various windows, keeping the driver from doing anything but twisting around in fright. Back outside the cockpit, Lin continues to stab away as the mechatank rolls backwards into some scaffolding.

The view zooms out from the dusty crash and through the side window of Hiroshi's cockpit. A burst of exterior fire lights the cockpit up with orange glow, and then the view cuts to show Korra Firebending at the mechatank. The humanoid vehicle rolls forward with hesitation, but then is pushed back by a burst of air that comes from over Korra's shoulder. The view cuts to show Tenzin in an Airbending stance, while Metalbenders are still wrangling mechatanks in the background. Tenzin moves towards Korra and off screen, each step carrying him into a different attack that unleashes powerful bursts of wind.

Cut to the Metalbenders. They are pulling at their whips, grunting with exertion, but they're starting to be pulled forward by their quarry. One even carves Earthbending gouges in the floor with his feet, but that fails to keep him in place. The view shifts to one of the Metalbenders' backs, where the spool of metal whip-wire is starting to smoke as the wire is yanked continuously by the struggle. The view cuts to one of the wrangled mechatanks, with two whips wrapped around its left claw. The arm moves around, trying to resist, then locks into place and pauses for a second. Suddenly, electricity emanates from the claw, traveling up the metal wire and shocking the Metalbenders. They all scream and get launched backwards. The mechatank is freed.

Lin, still stabbing away at her unmoving mechatank target despite having already shattered every window, turns to see what's going on and is immediately struck by one of the projectile grappling-claws. She is thrown off her mechatank, crashes and bounces off the nearby scaffolding, and then is yanked flying into the air by another mechatank. She comes to a hard landing on the floor and bounces a few times.

Elsewhere, Korra and Tenzin are double-teaming another mechatank. It's pushed up against a while, struggling against continuous fire and air blasts. The view cuts inside the tank's cockpit, where Hiroshi is being bounced around by the attacks. His pince-nez glasses are knocked off his face and fall off camera. Hiroshi growls, and pushes both his control levels forward. Outside, one of the mechatank's grappling-claws shoot forward at Korra, but she dodges with a series of backward flips that carry her out of the claw's continuing path. She Earthbends a chunk of the floor into the air and fires it back at the mechatank, but another claw comes at her from behind and catches her. She is pushed flying into a some of the metal machinery on the far side of the factory, and bounces off painfully.)

Tenzin: Korra!

(As Korra falls, Tenzin shoots out a swirling sphere of air that catches her and lands her softly on the ground. Seeing her safe, Tenzin turns back to the mechatank and dodges another grappling-claw attack. Within his cockpit, Hiroshi works some more levers, and his tank rolls foward while firing its claws again. Another mechatank joins the attack. Tenzin once again dodges all the claws, and jumps into an Airbending move that summons a giant, spinning wind-wheel around him. Tenzin rides it forward like he's surfing and avoids another claw, then leaps into the air. Hiroshi's mechatank stops and fire some new projectile, a metal disc that deploys small, whip-like tendrils. It catches Tenzin as he spins through the air in preparation for another counter-attack, wrapping around and electrocuting him. He lands hard on the floor and stays down.

Hiroshi's tank comes to a stop, and the front opens into a series of panels that lets the driver climb out. Hiroshi steps down onto the factory floor and looks at his defeated enemies- Lin, Tenzin, Korra. The Lieutenant steps forward to join him.)

Hiroshi: Well, I'd say that was a near flawless test run. (turns to the other mechatanks and points at the Benders) Load everyone into the transports and deliver them to Amon!

(The scene jumps to show a pair of trucks now parked amidst the mechatanks. Masked Equalists carry the unconscious Metalbenders to the trucks' cargo-containers. Off to the side, near where Tenzin, Lin, and Korra are lying, a panel of the floor lifts up slightly and scrapes to the side. Bolin and Mako peak out through the new hole in the floor.)

Bolin: Oh no.

(The Equalists toss another Metalbender into a truck.)

Mako: Korra was right! We gotta do something, quick!

(As the Equalists continue their work, the brothers sneak closer, stopping to hide behind a large cylindrical tank. After pausing to make sure they haven't been spotted, they run out to the others. Bolin gets Tenzin and hauls the Airbender up onto his back, audibly struggling with the weight, while Mako lifts up Korra on his own back. Then they both lean down and each grab one of Lin's arms.

The view suddenly cuts to Hirshi, wearing mechanical gloves that crackle with electricity. The Lieutenant is beside him, fighting sticks at ready.)

Hiroshi: Not so fast, boys.
Bolin: (drops Lin, and starts gesturing with Tenzin's arms) Hello, Mr. Sato. Wow. What a really, swell, scary, factory you have here under your giant mansion.
Mako: (icily angry) Sponsoring our team, supporting the Avatar. It was all just a big cover.
Hiroshi: Yes. And the most difficult part was watching my daughter... (closes eyes) traipse around with a Firebending streetrat like you!

(Hiroshi sends another shock through his gloves, and steps towards the brothers, but is halted by Asami's voice and turns around with surprise.)

Asami: Dad, stop! (closes eyes and turns her head away, then looks back at her father, sad) Why?
Hiroshi: (sadly) Sweetie, I wanted to keep you out of this for as long as I could, (view briefly cuts to Mako, still holding Korra as she wakes up) but now that you know the truth, please, forgive me. These people, these benders... They took away your mother, the love of my life. They've ruined the world! But with Amon we can fix it, and build a perfect world together. (Asami has a stunned expression, then averts her gaze.) We can help people like us everywhere. (Hiroshi takes off one of his electric gloves, and holds it out.) Join me, Asami.

(Asami just stares, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. She slowly moves towards her father. She looks at the glove with an expression that could be as much fear as wonder, and reaches out a trembling hand. Mako, Korra, and Bolin all watch. Bolin looks crushed. Asami takes the glove, and slips it on. She looks at it on her hand, her expression harsh.)

Mako: No.
Asami: (sad) I love you, Dad.

(Asami closes her eyes and turns her head, then shoves her gloved hand against Hiroshi's chest and hits him with a massive burst of electricity. He screams and then falls. As soon as he's down, the Lieutenant rushes over and tries to attack Asami with his sticks, but she gives a high kick that pushe his first blow out of the way. She stops his second attack by grabbing his wrist, and twists him around in an Aikido move that both brings him to his knees and shocks him with the glove. He collapses to the ground with a scream of his own.

Mako and Korra stare with stunned, slack-jawed expressions. Two of the mechatanks turn to view the commotion.)

Mako: Let's get out of here!

(The group follows Mako into a run. They hop down through the hole Bolin made before. Just as Asami is escaping, leaving only Bolin, one of the mechatanks fires off a series of the electrified bola-disks that had been used to subdue Tenzin. Before the first one lands, Bolin hops down the hole and pulls it shut behind him by Earthbending an adjacent slab of the floor over like a door. The next two disks bounce harmlessly off.

The scene cuts to outside, where the Metalbender airship is flying away from the Sato estate. Within, Asami watches through the windows as her home shrinks away. She looks devastated, and clutches a pole for support. The camera zooms over her shoulder to show Mako looking at her, with Korra behind him, then continues past them to a bench where Lin is lying. Tenzin stands over her.)

Lin: (weakly) My metalbenders are on their way to Amon, and it's all my fault. Tarrlok's right, I failed as Chief. First thing in the morning, I'm handing in my resignation.
Tenzin: (urgent) No! You can't give up like this.
Lin: (weak, but angry) I'm not giving up. (pulls herself up into a sitting position) I'm going to find my officers and take Amon down. But I'm going to do it my way, outside the law.

(Tenzin looks at her, but doesn't react.

Back with the others, Korra has her own defeated expression. Behind her, Bolin is looking out the window with Pabu on his shoulder. The camera pans to the side to show Mako right next to her.)

Mako: I'm sorry I didn't believe you, but Asami's dad being an Equalist is not an easy thing to believe, even now.
Korra: I know. I'm sorry this whole thing happened.
Mako: So, does your offer to live at the Air Temple still stand?
Korra: (smiling) Of course it does. And Asami's welcome too.
Mako: Thank you so much.
Korra: (puts a hand on Mako's shoulder) After everything she's been through, she's going to need you, Mako.

(Mako nods, then turns around and approaches Asami. He puts his arm around her, and she shifts to look at him before snuggling against his chest. Korra watches for a moment, then turns away. Outside, the airship approaches the glowing Republic City.)
