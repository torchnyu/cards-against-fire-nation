Avatar Escape - Yangchen
Transcriber: SMBH



(We see Aang and Hei Bai at the top of a mountain high above the clouds.)

Aang: Hello? Avatar Yangchen? Anyone here?

(Yangchen fades into existence in front of Aang and Hei Bai. She wears adult Air Nomad clothes: orange overcoat with long sleeves, a long, yellow tunic underneath, and a yellow waistband. She has a necklace pendant similar to the one Monk Gyatso wore.)

Yangchen: It's an honor to meet you, Aang.
Aang: It's been such an amazing experience to meet my past lives.
Yangchen: (Focus on Yangchen's face. She has a blue Airbender Master arrow on her forehead and long, brown hair that starts at the top of her head) And what did you learn by meeting them?
Aang: Well... I realized that no Avatar is perfect. They all struggled and made mistakes. Like me.
Yangchen: Very wise.
Aang: (close-up on his face) But it made me wonder - why is the Avatar Spirit a human in every life? Wouldn't it be better if the Avatar was an all-powerful spirit that never died?
Yangchen: I don't think so.

(Flashes into images as Yangchen speaks. We first see Katara doing a waterbending move. Sokka holding his boomerang appears as Yangchen begins to talk.)

Yangchen: (voice-over) The Avatar must be compassionate towards all people... (Toph appears in front of Sokka and Katara, between them, and in an earthbending pose, then Iroh appears standing next to Toph wearing Ba Sing Se clothes. Then Zuko appears behind Iroh, wearing his "Crossroads of Destiny" clothes) ...and the only way to do that is to live with them.

(Another flash and we see Appa being carried away by the sandbenders.)

Yangchen: (voice over) The Avatar must experience sadness... (Cut to Aang's face, crying). Anger... (cut to Aang in the Avatar State with robes flowing) Joy... (Cut to Aang and Katara penguin-sledding) ...and happiness.

(Cut to the image of the Gaang right after they recover Appa, from "The Earth King". Flashes end, and we go back to Aang and Yangchen's conversation at the top of the mountain.)

Yangchen: By feeling all these emotions, it helps you understand how precious human life is.... so you will do anything to protect it. (Zoom out and we see Aang, Yangchen and Hei Bai, who is lying on the ground) If you were an all-powerfull spirit living on the top of some mountain.... you wouldn't have much in common with an ordinary person.

(We see Yangchen from the front, and behind her we see ghostly images of the other three Avatars, starting with Kuruk closest to Yangchen, then Kyoshi behind Kuruk, and finally Roku, behind Kyoshi.)

Yangchen: So the Avatar continues to take human rebirth. And with each life, learns what it means to be human.
Aang: Now that I've reconnected with all of you, does that mean the Avatar Spirit is okay?
Yangchen: Yes. But your physical body is still injured. You need time to heal.

(Yangchen touches Aang's forehead. Aang's arrow tattoo starts glowing and so do Yangchen's hand and forehead arrows.)

Yangchen: And unfortunately, it seems your ability to enter the Avatar State has been disrupted. You won't be able to rely on your past lives to help you. You must rely on your friends. And when you wake up, you won't remember this journey to the Spirit World. It will be like a forgotten dream.

(Yangchen starts to fade away.)

Yangchen: Until we meet again, Aang.
