["Previously on The Legend of Korra" sequence, including clips from "Endgame."]

Shiro Shinobi: Six months ago, Avatar Korra defeated Amon and the Equalists. Since then, the Council was disbanded and the United Republic elected its first president. Tenzin's brother, Commander Bumi, retired and moved to Air Temple Island. And Korra and her boyfriend, Mako, have been the talk of the town. Peace has come to Republic City but unbeknownst to the Avatar, danger now threatens the Southern Water Tribe.       



Act I

(The film effect fades away to a shot of a fishing boat out on a dark, rainy night on the ocean as a fog horn blows. Cut to a shot of a Greenhorn and an Old Salt holding a lantern on the top deck of the boat.)

Old Salt: This your first watch?    
Greenhorn: Mm-hmm.               
Old Salt: Well then, you'd better keep your eyes peeled, laddie. You never know what creatures lurk in the murky depths.

(The Greenhorn gasps and looks down at the water while the Old Salt turns to leave, laughing quietly. Cut to a bird's eye view of the boat as a squid-like spirit the size of the boat swims underneath it. Cut back to the Greenhorn.)

Greenhorn: Uh, sir?
Old Salt: What? Ahh!!!

(The Old Salt screams as the spirit grabs him with one of its tentacles and pulls him into the water.)

Greenhorn: Man overboard! Man overboard!

(More tentacles emerge from beneath the water's surface and wrap around the fishing boat, pulling it under. The scene fades to the title card, then to a far, wide, panning down shot of the Pro-Bending Arena at night as spotlights shine around it. The fight bell can be heard ringing.)

Shiro Shinobi: It's pro-bending night in Republic City and have we got a doozy for you. (cut to an interior shot of the arena) Fan favorites, The Fire Ferrets, are about to take on hot newcomers, The Rhino-Lions.

(Cut to Bolin and Pabu wearing their uniforms. Pabu is standing on a railing.)

Bolin: Now we all know that our last match was garbage. Terrible. Even Pabu could have done a better job. (Pabu chirps and moves closer to Bolin) But that's in the past, because when you back a Fire Ferret in the corner, well, mister, he comes out fighting! (Pabu gets into a fighting stance and hisses.) So let's get out there and bend like there's no tomorrow. Are you with me?     

(The camera pulls back as Bolin does a fist pump and we see the backs of his teammates. Cut to a shot of the front of the teammates as the firebender girl holds her arm and looks down nervously, and the waterbending boy wipes his nose with his arm and sniffs loudly. Cut to a close shot of Bolin looking disappointed before the fight bell is rung. Cut to a zooming out shot of the two probending teams facing each other on the floor of the arena, summoning the elements as they prepare to fight. The camera quickly pans right as the Fire Ferrets are all knocked back over the egde of the arena. Cut to an overhead shot of the team plunging into the water below.)

Shiro Shinobi: Ooh, the Fire Ferrets go down in the water and right into the record books for the fastest knockout in pro-bending history.

(The fight bell is rung as we cut to a close up of Blolin climbing onto the edge of the floor out of the water, sighing in disappointment.)

Bolin: Where's Mako when I need him? 

(Cut to a closeup of Mako's motorcycle as he races it down the street and banks away from the camera. Police sirens are blaring from his bike as it flashes warning lights. Cut to a shot of a speeding truck taking a sharp turn at an intersection, its tires screeching. It drives towards the camera and past it with Mako in hot pursuit. Cut to a close up of Mako's eyes, wearing goggles over them, and slowly pan right. Cut to a shot from below with Mako's bike in the foreground as the gate of the truck ahead of him opens. Cut to a closer shot of two criminals in the back of thr truck, as one of them begins to waterbend. He holds the water out in front of the larger man. The larger man claps his hands together, and the water turns into steam, which engulfs Mako. The two waterbenders begin pouring more water onto the street. The smaller man exhales and the water turns into ice on the road. Mako gasps as his bike begins to slide over the ice. As it spins around, Mako throws fire at the ice and melts it, and regains balance. Cut to an overhead shot as the truck passes by a contruction site and smashes through a barricade. Another truck begins to cross in front of Mako. Mako banks to the left towards a makeshift ramp made of wooden boards leaning against a pickup truck. Cut to a close up profile shot of Mako and quickly zoom out as he uses firebending to boost his bike off the ramp. Mako flies over the escping truck. He twists his bike around in midair and shoots a blast of fire at the front of the tuck. The truck skids for a moment before the engine explodes, filling it with smoke. Mako lands in front of the truck and skids to a halt. The truck hits a fire hydrant and rolls on its side before it skids to a stop and its fuel tank explodes. Cut to a shot of three criminals climbing out of the broken windshield and landing in a pile on the street, exhausted. Mako approaches them and takes off his helmet and goggles, smiling.)

Mako: Looks like you had some car trouble, good thing the police are here.

(The sounds of a plane engine is heard before we cut to a close up of a plane's landing gear hitting a landing strip. Cut to a close shot of one of the plane's propellers moving into frame, then cut to a shot of Asami climbing out of the cockpit and taking off her helmet. She is approched by an engineer.)

Asami: I think these planes are finally ready to ship.      
Future Industries engineer: I hate to mention the elephant-rhino in the room, but since your father was thrown in prison, no company will work with us. We're nearly bankrupt.     
Asami: Don't worry, I'm going to the South Pole to meet with someone who can help us put Future Industries back on top.          

(Asami pats the engineer's shoulder and walks past him. The camera follows her as her smile turns into a frown of worry. Cut to an establishing shot of Airbender island as Oogi flies by. The camera follows the flying bison and stops at the ground, where we see Korra, Ikki, Jinora, and Meelo racing on air scooters. They disappear behind a hill for a moment before coming over the top of it in closer range of the camera, with Ikki ahead and Korra tailing behind. They go into a covered pathway where Pema is walking, holding Rohan, an ear of corn, and a large raddish. The airbenders speed by Pema, startling her and making her fumble with the vegetables.)

Pema: Woah! Ah!

(Korra and the children race around the airbending gates, making them spin. Cut to a shot of them dropping over a ledge and racing past the camera. Cut to a medium close shot from the side of Ikki ahead of Korra in the background and Korra in the foreground. Ikki looks back at Korra with a smirk and Korra looks back. Cut to a close up of Korra smirking as she turns her head back to the front and her eyes glow as she enters the Avatar State. Cut back to the side shot. Ikki looks on with surprise as Korra takes the lead. Cut to an overhead shot as Korra passes through the torii gate and wins the race with Bumi waving a checkered flag. Cut to a shot of Korra as she dismounts the air scooter. Cut to Bumi coughing from the dust kicked up as the airbender children cross the finish line.)

Bumi: The Avatar is the winner!

(Cut to a shot of Korra as she stands up and her eyes lose their glow as she exits the Avatar State. She turns and smirks and the camera pans left as Ikki approaches Korra angrily.)

Ikki: No fair, you can't go into the Avatar State to win.

(Korra sticks her tongue out at Ikki and makes a raspberry noise.)

Tenzin: (offscreen, sternly) You did what? (cut to Tenzin walking towards them) The Avatar State is not to be used as a booster rocket. You are toying with a dangerous power that you obviously do not appreciate.          
Korra: It's the "Avatar State" and I'm the Avatar. Who appreciates it more than me?       
Tenzin: Clearly, you need more training to grasp the depths of your spiritual connections. Not to mention that you're still a long way from mastering airbending.           
Korra: I have mastered airbending. 

(The camera quickly zooms out as Korra punches blasts of air at the surrounding shrubbery, sending leaves floating.)

Korra: See? Mastered.         
Bumi: Looks pretty good to me.   
Tenzin: (sighs and puts a hand to his face) Is it too late for you to un-retire from the United Forces?     
Bumi: The paperwork's gone through, little brother. From now on, it's 24/7 Bumi Time!

(Bumi grabs Tenzin's head and pinches his cheek. Tenzin makes him let go and walks up to Korra.)

Tenzin: You've mastered Korra-style airbending. Now you need to master real airbending. Hopefully, our visit to all of the Air Temples will give you the inspiration you need to delve more deeply into your studies.          

(Tenzing unscrolls a map of the Earth with the locations of the Air Temples marked, along with a cartoonish caricature of himself with a thumbs up drawn in the middle. Cut to a medium close shot of Korra looking appalled, then irritated before the camera zooms out and we see Ikki, Meelo, and Jinora.)

Jinora: Can we see where Grandpa Aang was born?  
Meelo: How many lemurs can I have?           
Ikki: I want to get tattoos, but instead of arrows, I want lightning bolts.     
Jinora: You can't get lightning bolts, that doesn't make any sense.              
Ikki: (angry) You don't make any sense!              
Meelo: (cheering) Fight, fight, fight!

(Ikki and Jinora press their foreheads against each other as they growl and glare at one another, before Tenzin pulls them apart.)

Tenzin: (sternly) No one's fighting! We're going to have a wonderful time. (sighs and puts a hand to his face) Now that the President is in office and I'm not needed on the council, I can finally relax with my family and give Korra the attention she needs.    
Korra: (sarcastic) Great. More attention.         
Bumi: (laughs) Relax? I'd pay money to see that. Maybe I'll tag along just to see "Vacation Tenzin." 
Tenzin: You're not invited.  
Korra: Before we go on your Dad's study trip, we're going to have some real fun in my hometown at the Glacier Spirits Festival. They've got rides, games, and all kinds of fried food on sticks.    
Jinora, Meelo, Ikki: simultaneously Yay!

(The children begin running around Tenzin and Bumi and cheering. Tenzin clenches his eyes shut a moment and frowns from the stress as Bumi puts an arm around his shoulder.)

Bumi: Yep, there's Vacation Tenzin. And you can't stop me from going to the festival, Mom already invited me.

(Cut to a long shot of a ship on the ocean at night with the moon shining above. Its horn blows and we cut to an overhead panning down shot of Korra and Mako sitting against Naga on the deck.)

Mako: So I walk up and say, "Looks like you had some car trouble, good thing the police are here."   
Korra: (chuckles) Did you write that beforehand? 
Mako: Yeah, I had a few others. (pulls out a piece of paper from under his shirt and reads) Let's see, uh... "Looks like you guys should put more 'try' in triad," Huh? Or, "when you get to jail, tell 'em Mako sent ya."     
Korra: Ooh, I like that one.     
Mako: Okay, I'll use that next time. Bei Fong says if I keep it up, I could make detective soon.              
Korra: Oh, that sounds so fun. All I do is train all day. It's like Tenzin's totally forgotten how I beat Amon.      
Mako: Tenzin's just trying to help you become the best Avatar you can be.           
Korra: Of course you'd take his side. 
Mako: I'm not taking his side. I'm just-
Korra: I'm gonna take a walk.

(Korra stands up and walks out of frame. Mako and Naga watch her leave. Mako turns to Naga.)

Mako: Why is it so much easier to bust triads than it is to get through one conversation with my girlfriend?

(Mako leans back against Naga and crosses his arms while Naga goes back to sleeping. Cut to a front overhead shot of the ship docked with a crowd of people gathered on the pier. Cut to a shot of Meelo, Jinora, and Ikki hugging Katara, while Kya stands to the side.)

Jinora, Meelo, Ikki: simultaneously Gran-gran!   
Katara: Oh, you've all gotten so big.         
Jinora: (hugs Kya) We missed you, Aunt Kya.      
Kya: Oh, I missed you too. (cut to a shot of Tenzin, Bumi, and Pema with Rohan approaching them from the ship) Your father doesn't bring you to visit nearly enough. He's probably scared I'll beat him up like when we were kids. (lightly punches Tenzin's arm)
Tenzin: I'm not scared of you... (rubs his arm) Any more. 

(Cut to a side shot of Korra hugging Tonraq while Mako stands behind Korra and Senna stands to the side.)

Korra: You remember Mako.  
Mako: (offers a hand shake) Sir.  
Tonraq: (crosses arms sternly) I hope you're not getting my daughter into any more trouble up in the city.      
Mako: Uh, no. I, uh--no.              
Korra: Knock it off, Dad.

(Tonraq chuckles and grabs Mako's hand, shaking it heartily. Bolin walks into frame.)

Bolin: Wow, look at all these people that came out to greet us.     
Korra: Uh, no... they came to greet them.

(Cut to a long shot of a royal Northern Water Tribe ship docking on the other side of the pier. The crowd claps and cheers. Cut back to Korra, Mako, Bolin, Tonraq, and Senna.)

Tonraq: (bitterly sarcastic) The great chief of the Northern Water Tribe comes to grace us with his presence. Hooray.
Senna: Just relax, Tonraq. He'll be gone soon enough. 

(Cut to a shot of the ship's flag, with an arctic hen perched at the top of the mast. The bird makes a call, flying towards the camera and out of frame. Cut to a side shot of Unalaq, Desna, and Eska walking down the plank to the pier, accompanied by guards. Cut to a close profile shot of Unalaq, then pan down and to the left to Eska and Desna. Cut to a shot of Korra, Mako, and Bolin.)

Bolin: Whoa, who are the lovely ladies?          
Korra: That's Eska and Desna, the chief's children. Desna is a guy.       
Bolin: Oh, no, sure. I knew that. And which one is Desna?

(Cut to a side shot of Unalaq and his group approaching Korra's group. Tenzin and his family stand in the background. Unalaq turns to Korra and bows.)

Unalaq: Good to see you again, Avatar Korra.   
Korra: (bows) Good to see you too. 
Unalaq: Tonraq.   
Tonraq: Brother.

(Cut to a shot of Mako and Bolin looking at each other worriedly. Cut to a low angle shot of Tonraq and Unalaq facing each other, with everyone else surrounding them. Cut to commercial.)



Act II

(Fade in to a wide establishing shot of the bay at the Southern Water Tribe and pan right to the city. Cut to a shot of people at the festival and pan right. Cut to Korra, Tonraq, Unalaq, and Tenzin walking down the street.)

Unalaq: It's a shame the Southerners have abandoned all connections to the spirits, even during the most hallowed times.    
Korra: I've always loved the Glacier Spirits Festival. It's fun.               
Unalaq: This festival used to be a solemn time of fasting and meditation. Now it's just a chance to watch some rube try to stick an entire arctic hen in his mouth.   

(Cut to a shot of Bolin sticking a cooked arctic hen on a stick into his mouth, with the other characters in the background. He turns to them.)

Bolin: (with mouth full) Wha- what? It's so good.    
Tonraq: Traditions change. It's not the end of the world.    
Unalaq: Tell that to the sailors who are being attacked by angry spirits in Southern waters. Some traditions have purpose.          
Korra: Wait, spirits are attacking ships?  
Unalaq: (nods) I'm surprised the Avatar doesn't know about that. Apparently you haven't been given all the information you need. It would be my honor to instruct you in the spiritual ways of the Water Tribe.       
Korra: I wouldn't mind learning about fighting spirits. Airbending is getting pretty boring.     
Tonraq: Tenzin is Korra's instructor. He can give her all the training she needs.
Unalaq: So you've said.

(Cut to a wide shot of the top of Varrick's ship and pan down to Asami and Bolin with Pabu on his shoulder.)

Asami: I'm glad you came with me to this meeting. Varrick is one of the richest men in the world, and he controls the entire global shipping business. So you're my assistant. Just stand there and don't say anything.     
Bolin: No problem, Pabu and I are natural assistants. Man, this is nice. I gotta get into this whole "business" thing.

(Asami and Bolin walk up the plank towards the ship. Cut to Varrick sitting on a cushion, his eyes closed and his fingers pressed against his head in concentration while Zhu Li sits beside him, writing on a notepad. He is surrounded by guests. The camera pulls back and Asami and Bolin come into frame. Cut to a close shot of Varrick's feet and pan up to his face. He suddenly opens his eyes and grins in excitement.)

Varrick: Did you see that? Levitation! I was a foot off the ground. Is that incredible or what?

(The camera pans around the room as the guests all clap.)

Male Guest #1: How does he do that?     
Male Guest #2:That's unbelievable.     
Male Guest #3: That's amazing.

(Cut to a shot of Varrick as he stands up and bows. Cut to a side shot of Bolin and Asami. Asami claps as Bolin scratches the back of his head in confusion.)

Bolin: It looked like you were just sitting on a pillow.

(Asami gasps and puts her face in her palm in embarassment. Cut to the guests as they gasp and turn to glare at Bolin. Cut to a close up of Varrick as he looks up in shock. He frowns and marches up to Bolin, leaning in close and making Bolin lean backwards as Asami watches. Pabu hides away in Bolin's shirt.)

Varrick: Are you saying I wasn't levitating?      
Bolin: (gulps) Uh... no?             
Varrick: Well, why didn't anyone tell me? Now I look like an idiot! Swami, you're fired!

(Varrick points at the Swami, who bows deeply and quietly walks away backwards. Varrick watches him go, then roughly slaps an arm around Bolin's shoulder, making Pabu jump away in fright out of Bolin's shirt.)
Bolin: Aah!
Varrick: I like you kid, you're a real straight shooter, just like me. Ms. Sato? He's with you?    
Asami: Mmm-hmm. (sighs in relief)
Varrick: Brought your tiger-shark with you to do business, huh? Now that's moxie. (Zhu Li shoos away two of the guests to make room as Varrick sits Bolin down on a cushion.) Get over here and pop a squat. Zhu Li, get some tea for my guests.
Asami: Thank you for meeting with me. As you know, Future Industries is looking for a partner to handle our shipping-
Varrick: Sure. But first, you gotta check out my new venture: moving pictures. Zhu Li, do the thing. You're gonna love this.

(Zhu Li shoves the tray of tea she is serving to Bolin into his arms. She quickly runs over to an object on a table with a red cloth draped over it. She removes the drape to reveal a film projector and quickly turns it on. Cut to Varrick and Asami as Varrick sits Asami down. The camera zooms in on the wall in the background as the projector starts. A silent, grainy clip of an ostrich horse running is played for a moment before Varrick's head comes into frame.)

Varrick: Mind-blowing, right?      
Bolin: (impressed) Yeah. 
Varrick: Now, forget that! That's the past! Shut it off, Zhu Li! Imagine watching this. Ginger, come over here and do your poses.

(Bolin gasps and we cut to a close up of a red haired women, Ginger, in a white fur coat, and saxaphone background music begins playing. The camera zooms out as she throws the coat to the floor and does a few sexy poses, puntuated by the music and a stylized background. Cut to Bolin, staring wide eyed and drooling, until Varrick gets in the way of his view. Bolin tries to look around Varrick at Ginger.)

Varrick: Spectacular! And we tell a story; there's romance, action, some funny animal stuff for the kids. You know, whatever. Thanks Ginger, go rest your gams. (sits between Bolin nd Asami) How about that, tiger-shark? We're gonna do big business with these "movers," as I call 'em.
Asami: Okaaay... but I'm just concentrating on getting Future Industries back on track. If we could hammer out a dea-         
Varrick: Stop. Look me in the eye. 

(Varrick presses his face right up against Asami and stares intensely into her eyes, making Asami look very awkward. The camera zooms in on them as there's a tense moment of silence. Asami gets a grip and stares back at Varrick with the same intensity. Varrick points his finger at Asami and grins.)

Varrick: We got a deal! 

(The camera zooms out to an overhead shot as Varrick sits up straight and points upwards, making Asami fall over. Zhu Li helps Asamiu up and the guests all cheer. Cut to a closer shot of Bolin, Varrick, and Asami as Varrick shakes Asami's hand.)

Varrick: We'll hammer out the details at the royal feast tonight. Now, who wants a rocket-boat ride? 

(The guests all cheer and follow Varrick out, leaving Asami, Bolin, and Pabu.)

Bolin: Is that how business usually goes?    
Asami: (happily hugs Bolin and ruffles his hair) You are a natural assistant.

(The scene cuts to several lanterns hanging overhead. The camera pulls back and focuses on an overhead shot of the dining room below. Cut to Korra and Unalaq sitting at the head table.)

Korra: This is a wonderful feast in your honor, Uncle.    
Unalaq: This is nothing. When this festival was founded, the tribal elders would commune with the spirits. People would watch the brilliant displays of light as spirits danced in the sky.
Korra: Wow. I've never seen that. 
Unalaq: And that is a shame, since the Avatar is the bridge between the material world and the spirits. That is why I want so badly to teach you, to help you fulfill your destiny.
Tonraq: (camera zooms out to show him sitting next to Korra) I thought I had made it clear that Tenzin is teaching her.        
Unalaq: Every Avatar before you traveled the world to learn. It was Tenzin and your father who kept you secluded at the South Pole.          
Korra: I thought Aang ordered the White Lotus to keep me down here?      
Tonraq: We all did what we thought was best for you.  
Korra: Who I train with should be my decision, Dad, not yours or Tenzin's.

(Cut to a shot of Tenzin looking back at Korra from further away. Bumi's head comes into frame and the camera zooms out to show Kya sitting beside Tenzin. Bumi gently elbows Tenzin.)

Bumi: Looks like someone's trying to take your place as the Avatar's stick-in-the-mud mentor.    
Kya: Bumi, don't pick on Tenzin, you know he's always been sensitive.   
Tenzin: I'm not sensitive!

(Tenzing crosses his arms and pouts as Kya and Bumi laugh. Cut to a shot of Katara holding Rohan in the background while Kya pokes Tenzin in the shoulder. Zoom in and focus on Katara watching sadly. Cut to a shot of Unalaq's back as he stands up to address the room.)

Unalaq: As your chief, it is my honor to speak at this festival, which was founded to bring our tribes together and restore the ancient balance between our world and that of the spirits. But I am saddened to see what it has become- A cheap carnival that celebrates greedy and trivial humans.

(Tonraq gives Unalaq an irritated look while he drinks from a cup. Cut to a shot of Varrick cleaning his teeth with his fingers while he uses his plate as a mirror. Bolin and Ginger are seated with him. Cut back to Unalaq.)

Unalaq: I fear the time is fast approaching when the North can no longer stand idly by while our Southern brothers slip into total spiritual decay. Angry spirits are already attacking ships in your waters. I only hope we are not too late to change course. 

(Unalaq sits back down and the people begin to mutter to themselves. Cut to a shot from the front as Varrick stands up into frame.)

Varrick: Chief Unalaq, everybody. Always great to have him in town. Now let's have some fun with Wacky Wushu's dancin' otter-penguins.

(Cut to a wider shot as Varrick steps away and Wacky Wushu dances in from the right. He waterbends a slide on the floor which three otter penguins slide across. He bend the water back the other way and the otter penguins slide back into view, standing up in front of Wushu before they all bow. The scene cuts to a wide, overhead establishing shot of the festival at night. Cut to Bolin, Mako, and Korra. Mako feeds Korra some cotton candy, which she greatly enjoys before feeding some to Mako. Bolin is eating rice balls on a stick and stares at the two of them with an annoyed look. Bolin turns his head away and sees something. Cut to Bolin's perspective as he sees Eska and Desna. Cut to a closer shot of Eska and Desna, then cut back to Bolin, Mako, and Korra. Bolin clears his throat, smirks, and nudges Mako with his elbow.)

Bolin: Wish me luck. (hands Mako his rice balls) I'm making my move. Whee!            
Mako: Good luck.
Korra: Those two have always creeped me out. They smell like a grandma's attic.

(Cut to Eska and Desna as Bolin approaches Eska.)

Bolin: Hey, I'm Bolin, a friend of Korra's. You're Eska, right? Wow, I'm just... I'm loving these robes.

(Eska turns to glare and hiss at Bolin. Bolin is a bit taken back before clearing his throat.)

Bolin: So... you are from the North, right? Cool. That's like, you know, that's like, my favorite direction.  
Desna: I think he is trying to establish some kind of bond with you based on your geographic point of origin.        
Eska: Perhaps it would be interesting to spend time with a person whose ways are so rough and uncultured. You amuse me. I will make you mine.      
Bolin: You mean like a boyfriend or... like a slave?     

Eska: Yes. (grabs Bolin's collar) Win me prizes.

(Bolin laughs nervously as Eska pulls Bolin with her and Desna. Cut to a shot of a water gun carnival game, using cute caricture cutouts of Aang as targets. Jets of water hit the targets, with the one closest to the camera hitting the hole in the targets mouth, causing Aang's arrow to light up and a cutout of Momo above his head to rise up. Cut to a shot of Mako and Korra from behind as they play the game. Mako is winning and Korra is missing.)

Korra: Unalaq offered to train me. He says he can teach me about the spirits and my connection to them. 
Mako: Sounds good. What does Tenzin think?     
Korra: Tenzin thinks I'm his prisoner or one of his kids. I'll never finish training with him in charge.    

(Korra uses waterbending to increase the size and pressure of her water jet. It hits the target full on and makes the Momo cut out quickly reach the top of the meter. Cut to the carnival barker shouting through a megaphone.)

Carnival barker: We have a winner!

(Cut to a close up of a plush Appa toy as Korra holds it up.)

Korra: I mean, you heard what Unalaq said. The South is spiritually unbalanced and it's the Avatar's job to fix it but my Dad won't even let me think about Unalaq teaching me. (beat) Well? 
Mako: Well, what?     
Korra: What do you think I should do?    
Mako: I guess you should do what you think is right. I support whatever decision you make.               
Korra: (sarcastic) Oh... thanks. That's a big help.
Mako: I thought you wanted me to be supportive. Now you want me to tell you what I think? Make up your mind.          
Korra: (throws the toy into Mako's arms and walks off) Just forget it.

(The scene cuts to a night time shot of several huts with lights on inside near a cliff as snow falls. Cut to a low angle shot of a wind chime hanging over a door. The wind blows it and it chimes softly. Cut to the inside and we see Korra sleeping against Naga. Naga lifts her head up to listen to something, then gets up to go outside. Cut to a close up of Korra looking tired.)

Korra: Ugh. Naga, what are you doing? (Naga starts howling) Naga, hush. (goes outside and sees Naga howling at the cliff's edge. She runs up to Naga and places her hands on Naga's neck) Quiet Naga, you'll wake everyone up.    

(Naga casually licks Korra's face and continues howling. Cut to Mako and Bolin exiting their own huts from below, with Korra and Naga in the background.)

Bolin: What's going on? 

(Cut to a close up of Korra as she turns to look at what Naga is howling over. Cut to a shot from Korra's perspective as a large dark spirit materializes.)

Korra: What. Is. That?

(The dark spirit suddenly runs towards Korra. It jumps at her from below and kicks her. Mako and Bolin see this and start running to her aid. Korra goes tumbling until she collides with the rocky ledge in front of her hut. The dark spirit's tendrils wrap round her arms and it pins her against the wall while it comes face to face with her. Cut to a close up of Korra and the dark spirit as Korra struggles and it slowly draws closer. Cut to commercial.)



Act III

(Fade in to the close up of Korra and the dark spirit restraining her. She struggles but can't break free. The camera quickly zooms out as the dark spirit begins to open its toothy jaws, just before it is hit with a blast of fire. The spirit drops Korra and turns to its attacker. Cut to a Mako and Bolin running forward. Mako begins punching more blasts of fire while Bolin slides over the ground and begins to bend the earth.)

Bolin: Got it!

(Bolin swings his arm upward and bends a thin wave of rocks aimed at the spirit. The spirit jumps to the side and the rock wave misses. Mako shoots another blast of fire at the spirit, but it dashes out of the way and then dashes at Mako and Bolin.)

Bolin: Don't got it!

(The dark spirit swipes at Mako and Bolin with its tail and knocks them down a hill. Tenzin, Tonraq, and Senna come out of their huts and go to help Mako and Bolin. Cut to Korra as she stands up and runs towards the dark spirit. She jumps and twists her body in the air to perform a vertical tornado kick, firebending a fast arc of flame at the spirit. The spirit dodges again and Korra punches a blast of fire at it, but misses again. The spirit closes the distance and Korra blasts fire at it from close range while jumping back. The spirit jumps into the air and begins falling towards Korra. Cut to the spirit's point of view of Korra as it dives at her. Korra dodges out of the way and the spirit crashes into the snow. Behind Korra we see Tonraq ride towards her and past her on an elevated ice slide.)

Tonraq: Korra!

(Tonraq circles around the spirit and begins bending large ice walls around it to trap it. Tonraq comes to a stop and there's a short moment of silence before the spirit's tendrils burst out of the top of the ice cage. The tendrils violently grab Korra and Tonraq and toss them around. Tonraq hits the front wall of a hut and falls down, while Korra is flung down the hill towards the festival. The spirit breaks out of the ice cage and Tenzin jumps up from below and approaches the dark spirit.)

Tenzin: Spirit, why are you angry with us? What have we done to offend you? 

(The spirit turns to look at Tenzin for a moment behind swiping its arm at him and knocking Tenzin away. Cut to a far shot and zoom out as we see Tenzin flying away from the spirit and hitting thw snow in the background. In the foreground we see Korra from the back standing up. Cut to a close up of Korra as she inhales deeping and puts her fist into her palm, closing her eyes and entering the Avatar state, her eyes glowing when she opens them. Cut to the spirit as it rushes at Korra. Cut to Korra as the wind kicks up around her and she floats into the air. The dark spirit jumps and dives at Korra, but Korra flies into the sky and out of the way on a thin tornado. The dark spirit bursts through the festival fence and goes skidding over the fair ground before righting itself and coming to a halt. 

Before it has time to act, the dark spirit is hit by a barrage of fire blasts from Korra as she circles around it. The spirit is briefly hidden by a large, orange fire cloud, and then out of its tendrils shoots out from the cloud and snatches Korra. Korra yells in pain before the tendril throws her into a tll stck of wooden crates. Korra is disoriented as she tries to get back up. She looks up as the dark spirit begins to approach her. It raises its harm to attack her but stops as water begins to circle around it. The dark spirit looks to the side, and we cut to Unalaq waving his arms in a circle, bending the water. The water begins to take on a more defined spiraling ring shape around the spirit. Cut to Korra as she watches, and there is a glow. Cut to the now calmed spirit as the water around it starts to emenate a golden glow. Unalq raises his arms over his head, and the dark spirit starts to glow as well. Cut back to Unalaq lowering his arms, then cut to a long, wide shot of the scene as the glowing water rings dissipate and the spirit slowly walks off. Cut to a shot from behind Unalaq as he watches the spirit go.)

Unalaq: Go in peace.

(The spirit dissolves into golden specks that fly into the wind. Korra runs up to Unalaq and looks to the spirit She turns as Tonraq and Tenzin run up to them.)

Tonraq: Korra! 
Tenzin: Are you all right?

(Tonraq puts a hand on Korra's shoulder, but she shrugs it off as she addresses Unalaq.)

Korra: How were you able to control that spirit when no one else could?     
Unalaq: As your father could tell you, I have spent my life studying the spirits and learning their ways. All of this knowledge is lost in the South, but I could teach you everything I know.
Tenzin: Chief Unalaq, clearly you are very knowledgeable but Korra still has much to learn about airbending, and I hope that going to the Air Temples will help her connect with the past Avatars.
Korra: Ugh.
Unalaq: The Air Temples will teach her nothing. Only I can give her the training she needs to be a complete Avatar.      
Tonraq: I've told you that will not happen.  
Korra: Hey, I'm right here! Anyone want to ask me what I think?          
Tenzin: Korra please, listen.  
Korra: I'm tired of listening to you. Both of you. You keep me locked up, telling me you know what's best but both of you were powerless against the spirit attack. (there is a brief pause as Tenzin and Tonraq glance sadly at each other) I think it's time I had a new teacher.      

(Tenzin closes his eyes and tilts his hed down sadly.)

Tonraq: Now, Korra-
Korra: Unalaq has proven he's the only one who knows what I need to learn. I have to go with him.     
Tenzin: Please, I know you're angry, but we've come so far together.        
Korra: I'm sorry, Tenzin. (crosses arms and looks away) This is as far as we go.    

(There is a brief moment as Tenzin lets Korra's response sink in.)

Tenzin: It has been a pleasure serving you, (bows) Avatar Korra.

(Tenzin begins to walk away. Cut to a wide overhead shot and we see the rest of the characters watching from dwn the path. The scene cuts to Tenzin tying up a sack while in the background his family is riding on top of Oogi. He looks up when he hears Katara, and we cut to her with Kya and Bumi on either side of her.)

Katara: I think you forgot a couple of things.       
Tenzin: (blinks) Mother, I think I need some time alone with my family right now. (picks up the sack and turns away)
Katara: This is your family, Tenzin. When you get to be my age, you'll be thankful for the time you had with your siblings. Besides, I think it's important that you all visit your father's home together.  

(Tenzin turns back and puts the sack down, just before Bumi walks up and punches his arm and puts an arm around him, followed by Kya.)

Bumi: Come on, it'll be fun.    
Kya: I'm dying to see that laid-back "Vacation Tenzin" I've heard so much about.       
Tenzin: All right, hop on. (Bumi and Kya walk past him towards Oogi. Tenzin walks up to Katara and they hug) I love you, Mom. We'll see you soon.   

(Cut to a shot of Bumi struggling to climb onto Oogi, with Tenzin's leg in the foreground. Tenzin kicks backwards and sends a gust of air at Bumi, sending him flying upwards and onto the saddle.)

Bumi: Oh!

(Cut to a wide shot of the festival ground as Oogi flies away and out of frame. The camera pulls back and pans left to reveal Korra and Mako watching them leave. Cut to a close up of Korra and Mako.)

Korra: Do you think I did the right thing?   
Mako: (sighs) I don't know. I'm sorry, but I'm not very good at this Avatar counseling thing. But I know your heart is in the right place, you'll just have to trust it.       

(Cut to a close up of Korra and Mako's hands as Korra takes Mako's hand in hers and they intertwine their fingers. Cut to an extreme close up of Mako as he looks down at his hand, then up at Korra and smiles. Cut to a close up of Korra smiling back. We hear footsteps and Unalaq places his hand on Korra's shoulder. The camera zooms out and pans left to Unalaq.)

Unalaq: I know this was a hard decision Korra, but it was the right one. Now it is time to put it behind you and begin your new training. I have great plans for you.
